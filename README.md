## The Legalisation of Abortion in Ireland
### A Linguistic Analysis based on the Speeches of the Oireachtas between 1980 and 2018

This is a more in depth linguistic analysis of my other project (Abortion_Debate_Ireland_No.1) which I wrote in 2019. 
We expanded and enhanced the dataset and did more detailled analyses on the speeches.
