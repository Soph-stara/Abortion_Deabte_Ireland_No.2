10;Private Members' Business. - Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1980: First Stage (Resumed).;03.06.80;M;Mr. Séan Browne;Fianna Fáil;Deputy Noel Browne has moved that leave be given to introduce the Bill and this motion has been opposed by the Government. The Deputy has five minutes to support his motion.;1938728
11;Private Members' Business. - Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1980: First Stage (Resumed).;03.06.80;M;Dr. Noel C. Browne;Clann na Poblachta;The reason for the introduction of this Bill is simply to permit a referendum to be carried out in order to allow the public to decide whether they are in favour of deleting Article 1. 3.2 and 41. 3.3 allowing for a law permitting divorce where there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in marriage. This facility is already available in the North. It is usual, where the Government opposes such a Bill, for the Opposition parties, while not necessarily supporting the principles of the Bill, in the interest of democratic parliamentary practice to permit the Bill to be at least introduced and printed and then discussed. This occurred in the Capital Punishment Bill some years ago and, of course, in the contraceptive Bill later on. Ideally in an important issue where conscientious doubts are said to be held by Deputies both for and against the right to divorce, a free vote of the House [1471] should be permitted. Since the right to divorce is already a part of Labour Party policy and Deputy FitzGerald has recently advocated that amending legislation in respect of and amendments to the Constitution should be introduced and the Taoiseach has equally expressed his commitment to radical constitutional changes if so requested by the Northern Unionists I hope that the discussion on this subject, the right to divorce, will at least be permitted by all-party agreement. There is no doubt but that the legitimacy or validity of a minority civil right should not depend on the size of the minority. All of us know, however, that responsible authorities exist for the belief that changing attitudes of women to the social role in society, new stresses due to industrial and socio-economic changes have led to an increase in the breakdown of marriage in the Republic and an increasingly insistent demand for the right to divorce. Recent ESRI figures show that up to some 50 per cent of people are in favour of some form of divorce laws. Further, our failure to provide suitable housing accommodation, secure, well paid jobs and recreational facilities for children have added to the destructive pressures on family life in the Republic. Since the vast majority of the people of the Republic are members of the Roman Catholic Church, this Church while itself permitting effective dissolution of marriage and subsequent remarriage under its own annulment procedure does not favour civil divorce. For this reason I suspect that successive Governments and political leaders have failed to introduce a law permitting divorce in the Republic. In recent years the Catholic Church has made it clear however that Catholic legislators may both advocate and enact laws opposed to their Church's teaching but considered by the legislators to be in the common good. Such, I suggest, is this proposal on the need for divorce now in the Republic. There are number of reasons, the most compelling of which are humanitarian and compassionate. [1472] There is as well the question of our respect for Article 44 which guarantees the rights of a religious minority to their freedom to practise their religion. Concerned action by the Catholic majority now conceding this civil right to a relatively helpless religious minority would more readily establish our bona fides on the issue of genuine concern for the rights of a religious minority in an ultimately united Ireland. Because of its consistent failure to implement the basic principles of pluralism, secularism and radicalism in our Constitution and laws I have continuously questioned the validity of Irish Republicans' claim to represent an authentic Republican philosophy. I have consistently held that Mr. de Valera's 1937 Constitution has been the greatest single impediment to political rapprochement between the peoples of the North and South. I am glad to see that the Leaders of Fine Gael and the Government party, through the Taoiseach in Downing Street and subsequently at his press conference, have conceded that radical amendments to the Constitution are now needed. I suggest that this is not a time for new time consuming commissions of inquiry since such an inquiry, the prestigious all-party Dáil Committee in 1967, have already established the need for some form of divorce procedures. There is an urgent and growing severe human problem in our society with much avoidable suffering involving adults and children alike to whom a Bill of this kind can bring badly needed help. I ask for support at least in allowing for discussion in the Dáil of the serious issues involved.;1938729
12;Private Members' Business. - Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1980: First Stage (Resumed).;03.06.80;M;Mr. Gerard Collins;Fianna Fáil;I have already indicated to Deputy Browne that I oppose the motion. As the Deputy is aware, recently the Taoiseach said in this House that the Government had no plans at present to promote legislation to amend the Constitution to remove the prohibition on the grant of a dissolution of marriage. It will be readily appreciated by Deputies that it would be inconsistent with that statement if we were not to oppose this motion which [1473] seeks leave to introduce a Bill designed to do precisely that. On any issue as basic as this the Government should not be neutral but should oppose a piece of legislation for which, in their view, there is not any significant level of public support. The Government recognise and are deeply concerned about the hardship and suffering that arises for people whose marriages have broken down. However, to be in any way ambiguous about the possibility of divorce legislation would be misleading to those amongst them who might wish to avail themselves of divorce facilities in that it would hold out prospects that are unlikely to materialise. It would also be seriously disquieting to what I have no serious doubt constitutes the majority of our people who support the constitutional prohibition on divorce. Any legislative proposal to hold a referendum would necessitate a full analysis of what a civil divorce law would entail. I believe such an analysis at this stage would only serve to demonstrate the size of the existing majority opposed to such legislation and would not serve any useful social purpose. Finally, I should like to refer briefly to what is sometimes regarded as the related question of nullity. There is some misunderstanding on the question of nullity. It is simply not the case that the constitutional prohibition on divorce prohibits also changes in the civil law of nullity. Attempts are made to suggest that the existence of a number of annulments that are not recognised in civil law is a problem that is created and made insoluble by our Constitution. It is not. The Constitution does not prohibit changes in the law of nullity and the reasons for the problems are quite separate from the existence of the constitutional prohibition on divorce. There are, however, very complex issues involved and these were recognised by the previous Government when they referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission. That nullity and divorce are separate concepts is shown by the fact that nullity is well known to the laws of [1474] other countries, even those which have divorce. Question put.;1938730

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage.;09.02.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;Limerick East): Tairgim: 'Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.' I move: 'That the Bill be now read a Second Time.' The Bill proposes to amend section 3 of Article 40 of the Constitution by adding the following subsection— '3º The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.' The Government are proceeding with [1354] this measure in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government that legislation would be introduced to have adopted the Pro-Life Amendment published by the outgoing Government. As stated in the Programme, the Parliamentary Labour Party reserve the right to a free vote on this issue. I am sure the reasons for proposing that the Constitution should be amended in this respect will be familiar to all Deputies, having regard to the publicity which this issue has received over the past year or so but, for the record, I think it right to refer briefly to the background. The existing statute law on the subject is contained in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861. The effect of those sections, broadly speaking, is to make it an offence unlawfully to procure an abortion. Until recent years, those provisions were regarded as adequate but developments, mainly in other countries, have taken place which have given rise to concern amongst many people. It has become apparent that judicial decisions concerning abortion can alter fundamentally what had been accepted to be the law, even to the extent of introducing what is virtually a system of abortion on demand. I do not suggest that there was any widespread fear that such a development might occur for a number of years ahead as far as our own Supreme Court is concerned. There was also, however, another and, I believe, a well-founded fear. That was that a situation might arise where an Irish Government might find itself pressurised by a decision made abroad — in Strasbourg, for example — into introducing legislation to facilitate abortion or, in the alternative, faced with a series of legal actions before the European Court. Recent developments in cases taken under the European Convention on Human Rights are such as to suggest that that Convention may be interpreted as conferring a right to have an abortion. I do not suggest that a constitutional change would affect the decision that may be made by the European Commission or Court but, if the people of this State now indicate through a referendum that [1355] they do not want abortion to be facilitated, it seems to me that that expression of the people's will must prevail. It is quite clear, of course, that this State could never have signed that convention if it had been seriously thought that it might one day be interpreted in a way that would make pro-abortion legislation compulsory. I may say in passing that I very much hope it will never be so interpreted because, if it is, I believe that it will prove detrimental to the further development of international agreements relating to human rights and freedoms. I say this because the interpretation of a convention or similar agreement in a wider way than was ever thought possible at the outset, while it may appear at first sight to be a vindication of a particular point of view, cannot but make Governments much more reluctant to enter into any further commitments of a similar kind since they cannot know what they may be committing their countries to. It will be clear from what I have already said that I am not suggesting that there is any serious risk that the Supreme Court as it is now constituted would hold that the Constitution as it stands is such as to be incompatible with the present statutory prohibition on abortion. Indeed, the very opposite might well be the case — the court might hold that there is already a constitutional protection for the unborn even though it is not explicitly stated. The issue has not, in fact, come before the courts but there are two dicta of Mr. Justice Walsh which suggest that the unborn child has a constitutionally protected right to life. It will suffice to refer to one of them. In G. v. An Bord Uchtála, he said- '[The child] has the right to life itself and the right to be guarded against all threats directed to its existence whether before or after birth .... The right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend and to have preserved and defended, that life.' Nevertheless, that view, however persuasive, is not binding. Our constitutional law is in a continuous state of development. [1356] In this context, it is necessary to think of the United States Supreme Court decision on marital privacy. That proved to be the first step on the road to what has become something very close to abortion on demand. Such changes could come about in disregard of deeply-felt convictions of the majority, even the great majority, of the general public. Changes have come elsewhere as a result of legal decisions with consequences that have dismayed even some of the very people who were originally to the fore-front in advocating liberalisation of the anti-abortion laws. These were the considerations that led my party — and, I assume, the main Opposition Party though perhaps I should make it clear that I am not authorised to speak for them — to agree to propose a constitutional amendment to protect the right of the unborn so that the amendment might be put to the people by way of referendum. The Bill we are debating today was presented to this House by the previous Government last November and, having lapsed on the dissolution, was restored to the Order Paper on the initiative of this Government. That is all I think I need say on the background. It will be clear from what I have said that, as I see it, the object of the amendment, to put it briefly, is to ensure that, unless and until the people in another referendum decide otherwise, the kind of statutory restriction on abortion that is contained in the existing law, as that law is generally understood to be, can be retained without risk of being set aside by any judicial authority, domestic or foreign, and moreover that it will in fact be retained. One could make the same point in another way by saying that the object is to ensure that what is commonly called legalised abortion does not become a feature of our law or of our society against the wishes of the people. Although the Government of which I an a member were not involved in the drafting of the proposed amendment, we are in no doubt that the drafting of the amendment presented difficulties. It is indeed apparent that many drafts were produced by various people before the present text was adopted and put forward. [1357] I am sure that the previous administration would not have claimed that it is a perfect text — there is no such thing as a perfect text in such a context — but I, for my part, acknowledge fully the work done in this respect by the previous Government. That work produced the present text which, when it appeared, met with a substantial measure of support or acceptance even amongst people who had been sceptical, though more recently there is evidence of some second — or perhaps I should say third — thoughts. My party accepted the amendment as reasonable. Having as I hope clearly acknowledged the work done and the merits of the text produced by the previous administration, I also acknowledge that, more recently, questions have arisen as to whether the particular wording of the amendment could cause unforeseen difficulties. For example, on the one hand, I have been advised that, on one particular interpretation, the amendment could in fact have an effect very different indeed from what it might at first sight appear to have and that it could positively facilitate the introduction of abortion on a very wide scale. That point, though it has received some brief mention in print, has not to my knowledge been widely made, but it is of its nature a serious point that deserves to be and must be seriously considered. On the other hand, on another interpretation of the text, which has been put to me by a very responsible authority as a probable interpretation, it could require the State to make the 1861 Act more restrictive than it is, which I think is something that nobody has suggested it is either necessary or appropriate. I think it right to emphasise that I am not saying that any of the interpretations to which I have referred would necessarily be upheld by the Supreme Court, but they have been put by responsible people as interpretations that could be supported by reasoned argument and that might prevail. Moreover, quite apart from those points that have already come before me in various ways, I am more than willing to listen with an open mind to anything said by anyone inside this House or outside that will help to clarify [1358] the text and prevent any future difficulties. But I would not like there to be any misunderstanding about this. When I say that I have an open mind about suggestions for amendment, I mean of course suggestions that would not affect or erode the underlying principle of the amendment which is that the practice of abortion in the ordinary sense of that term should not be permitted to creep into our law. I am committed to that underlying principle and there is no point in my saying that I will give consideration to any suggestions that would conflict with it. Such suggestions cannot be accepted as far as I am concerned. That, I think, is all I need to say at this stage about the reasons for introducing the Bill and about my attitude to the particular wording of the constitutional amendment which it proposes. It would be unreal, however, if I were to leave it at that and ignore the fact that the proposal has attracted criticism based on the contention that it reflects a sectarian view of the rights of the unborn or, at best, that it reflects a view that ought not to be enshrined in the Constitution as distinct from ordinary legislation. In principle I do not see that any distinction can be drawn in this context between a statutory provision and a constitutional one to the same effect. It is possible to argue that it is unwise to give constitutional status to a particular statutory provision but that is a different matter. I do not think that it is possible to argue that a provision which in a statute is not sectarian can become so if it appears in the Constitution. A number of those who have described the amendment as sectarian are using arguments which, if valid, would also apply to the existing law. The existing law, however, is contained in a statute that was enacted by the Westminster Parliament for the whole of the then United Kingdom in the year 1861. It is a statute that operates to this day in Northern Ireland. I leave that point at that and move on to the substance of the criticism that has been made. Some of that criticism has come from people speaking from what I might call the secular-humanist stand-point. [1359] I cannot hope to convince anybody of that way of thinking. If a person believes that a woman has a right to have an abortion at any time and for any reason or none — that the matter is exclusively her concern and that, as the expression has it, hers is the 'right to choose'— there is really no common ground that I can see for debate between that person and somebody who believes that pre-natal life is human life with independent rights of its own, rights that are in some sense commensurate with its status as human life. What I have to say must therefore be primarily addressed to people who support the underlying idea that abortion normally is, at the very least, an offence against human rights but who nevertheless believe that it must be accepted as the lesser of two evils in certain circumstances. Even on that basis, there is a major problem about discussion because of the very wide variation in what different people would regard as sufficiently exceptional to justify an abortion. Not only is there no agreement amongst different religious denominations on this issue but, in many cases, there can be wider differences of view within a particular denomination than between one denomination and another. The law cannot cater for the variety of attitudes which different people may conscientiously hold unless it is wide enough to cater for the view that accepts what amounts to abortion on demand. Of course, one must take that a stage further and ask why the law should not allow even for abortion on demand. Why, in what is claimed to be a pluralist society, are minorities not allowed to have abortions where their consciences so permit? For an answer to that, one has to look at the nature of the problem. If a person believes that the unborn have a right to life, even though it be only a qualified right, that person cannot agree that the law should allow that right to life to be taken away simply because somebody else, even somebody so intimately and uniquely related to it as its mother, decides that it should be so taken. Even [1360] if it could be shown that that view about the right to life of the unborn was objectively invalid, those who hold it would still have the same duty to act according to their consciences and, in so far as they could through the laws enacted on their behalf, to protect what they see as human life. For those who believe that another human life is at stake, the matter is clearly not a purely private decision but a matter which ought to be dealt with by the law and, while giving due weight to the rights of the mother, they must logically afford that protection even against the wishes of the mother. Indeed, if that were not so, abortion law would have little meaning. There is, however, a special difficulty if in fact the attitude to which I have referred about the importance of pre-natal life is, for all practical purposes, exclusively held by members of one church even if they may be in the majority. I think, therefore, it is worth looking at the facts a little more closely. First of all, an important distinction must be made. It is one thing to say that abortion should be permitted for special reasons at a certain stage of pre-natal life and quite another thing to say that the early stages of pre-natal life are such that the life that is there has no rights at all. I do not think it is either necessary or desirable for me to attempt to discuss here whether, in any debate about life at and from human conception, one should seek to distinguish between 'life', 'human life', 'human being' and 'human person'. In very large measure, that kind of argument is sterile because it is often a matter of how one defines the terms one is using. The substantive question at this point is whether there is any validity in the claim that the Catholic Church is alone in holding that the point at which pre-natal life has a claim to protection is the time of conception. The question of possible exceptions to a general prohibition on abortion can be dealt with later. There is, of course, no doubt that the Catholic Church holds that the critical point is the time of conception. There is equally no doubt that some opponents of the amendment, in seeking to establish that the amendment is sectarian, have [1361] given the impression that the emphasis on conception as the relevant time is, in their language, the 'Catholic' view. Incidentally, if anybody doubts that that is the impression given, even by casual references, I would refer to a recent leaflet of the Anti-Amendment Campaign where they expressly referred to the possibility of the expression 'the unborn' being interpreted as operative from the time of conception as being an interpretation 'in a strictly Catholic sense'. May I say in passing that I myself am using the word 'Catholic' simply as the term that corresponds with ordinary usage in this and many other countries — I am sure I need not state that I am not using it in any way that would be offensive to those Protestants who apply the adjective 'Catholic' to themselves or their Church. The Church of Ireland have issued several statements on the amendment. They oppose the amendment for reasons they have given. They have, incidentally, not only not used words such as 'sectarian' but have gone to trouble to correct allegations that they had done so and I believe that, when the dust of this present controversy has settled, they will be recognised for the care they have taken in what they have said. In their statements, they have consistently referred back to — and one may fairly say they have taken their stance on — a report presented to the Lambeth Conference of 1958. That report, which I assume from the Church of Ireland statements was in fact adopted by the Lambeth Conference, accepts the possibility of abortion at the dictate of 'strict and undeniable medical necessity'. I shall come back to that later. At this stage I simply note that the fact that the report admits some exceptions on grounds of medical necessity gives added force to what I now want to say about another point in the report, namely that it also includes the following: In the strongest terms Christians reject the practice of induced abortion, or infanticide, which involves the killing of a life already conceived ... May I repeat the words: 'the killing of a life already conceived'? So it seems that [1362] the Anglican Church too, or in our context the Church of Ireland, takes the view, in the context of an examination of the problem of abortion, that conception is the point of critical significance. I believe that the words 'the unborn' quite probably would be interpreted by the Supreme Court as being applicable from conception but for reasons independent either of Catholic or Church of Ireland theology. I understand that the weight of legal opinion is strongly behind the proposition that that is how the existing law of the land is to be interpreted. That is all the more significant when the particular law is exactly as we inherited it at the foundation of the State — the same law as then obtained in the neighbouring island — and therefore, one may reasonably assume, not influenced overtly or covertly by any ecclesiastical pressure groups. I give the following quotation, the date of it is 1957 but, despite legal changes since then which liberalised abortion law in England, the basic position as to what is covered by the law remains, even to this day. The quotation reads: At present, both English law and the law of the great majority of the United States regard any interference with pregnancy, however early it may take place, as criminal unless for therapeutic reasons. The foetus is a human life to be protected from the moment when the ovum is fertilised. Again, the words at the end of that bear repetition: ' ...a human life to be protected from the moment when the ovum is fertilised'. The quotation is from page 141 of The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law by Dr. Glanville Williams, acknowledged as one of Britain's most eminent academic lawyers and, as it happens, a strong advocate of liberal abortion laws. Incidentally, in case anybody should think that even Dr. Williams, in the tradition of Homer, could have nodded on that particular occasion, I could add that the same statement of the law may be found in another work of his, volume 5 of Current Legal Problems — The Law of Abortion, pages 128-129. [1363] Is this acknowledgement of conception as the critical point peculiar to the common law countries? Apparently not. The Report of the European Commission on Human Rights in a 1977 case, Bruggemann and Scheuten v Federal Republic of Germany, paragraph 60, states that a survey of 13 states who are parties to the European Convention on Human Rights revealed that, and I quote, 'without exception, certain rights are attributed to the conceived but unborn child ...'. It may be that the word 'conceived', in relation to some of the states concerned, is an interpretation by the Commission, but the word is apparently actually used in the laws of a number of the 13 states. If we go further afield, to the western hemisphere, we find that the American Convention on Human Rights, which was drafted under the auspices of the Organisation of American States and which came into force in 1978, provides, in Article 1, that the right to life shall be protected by law and, I quote, 'in general, from the moment of conception'. Once again it will be seen that the emphasis is on conception as the critical time. So, the proposition that conception is the point of commencement of life the taking of which constitutes abortion and to which legal rights are attributed is more than just a peculiar notion of the Catholic Church or of it and the Anglican Church. It is a proposition that in one way or another seems to be reflected in the laws of most of what is usually described as the western world. This, of course, does not in any way imply that those laws do not admit of wide exceptions. Obviously they do and, as I have already indicated, the United States Supreme Court has decided that the rights of privacy of the mother take precedence over the rights of the various states to legislate as they might wish, at all events until a late stage in pregnancy, but that is not the point that is now at issue. The point that I am making is that I think it must be quite probable that the Supreme Court would interpret the words 'the unborn' as extending back to the time of conception and that if they were to do so they would not in any [1364] rational sense of the term be applying a peculiarly 'Catholic' interpretation to those words. If we agree, even as a working hypothesis, that that is how the expression would be likely to be interpreted and that there is ample legal support from the laws of other countries for adopting such an approach, there still remains, of course, the problem about exceptions and I will not try to deny that it is a very, very difficult one and, at the end of the day, there may be no real solution but only an appeal for mutual understanding. I hope, however, that I may have some contribution to make at least towards promoting mutual understanding. Why cannot we have clearly expressed exceptions to cater for the views of minorities? I have already touched on the nature of that problem: first, that we are dealing here with deep-seated convictions that what is at issue is not the right of dissent but the protection of independent human life and, second, that there is such wide disagreement about the exceptions that no law could cater for all opinions without reducing itself to something meaningless. In a recent newspaper article — in The Irish Times of 2 February 1983 — a prominent spokesman of one of the Protestant Churches was quoted as having made certain comments and, in between the direct quotations, there was what appears to be an attribution of opinion to him in the following terms: But that didn't change the basic opposition to the amendment and though the 'life of the mother' clause would cover some of the Protestant requirements for termination of pregnancy it didn't cover the psychological health of the mother or the position of rape victims. If this is in fact a substantially accurate attribution — and it is in line with what has been said by others so in any event it represents a point that calls for an answer — it immediately raises two difficulties. The first is that it is not easy to see how there could be anything that could properly be identified as 'Protestant requirements for termination of pregnancy', bearing in mind that the Irish Council of [1365] Churches in their statement have expressly drawn attention to the fact that differing views are held amongst the member Churches. The second difficulty is perhaps even more important. I can well understand and sympathise with the feeling of concern which underlies references by a Christian clergyman to the psychological health of a mother in distress, but the sad fact is that if one were to invite someone to write an abortionists' charter, something that would most simply and effectively provide for abortion on demand without actually using those very words, the ready-made phrase is 'the psychological health of the mother'— not, indeed, that any variation on that theme would be much better. It is not a question of being on the slippery slope — with that kind of provision or proviso in the law, we would already have reached the end of the slope: we would have arrived. I know of no way around this obstacle. Even if there were no difficulties in principle in providing for exceptional circumstances in which the law might treat induced abortion as acceptable, I know of no way in which the law could provide for exceptions based on hard cases without leaving the door open for abortion on an increasing scale, all the more so when even here the public are being bombarded, day in day out, with pro-abortion propaganda. If anybody, whether representative of any of the Churches or of the Jewish community or of any other group, can produce to me a text that will meet those problems, I have already indicated that he or she can be assured that I will give the suggestion my fullest consideration and nothing that I have said or that I will have to say in any way takes from that. I want now to refer briefly to hard cases. I would like to make it quite clear that by hard cases I mean a very small minority of cases where an abortion may be sought in very difficult circumstances. I am not referring to certain drug treatment that may be afforded to a rape victim within a fairly short time of the rape. I am not referring to that because, on the information available to me at present, and having regard to the special [1366] considerations that have to be taken into account where a rape has taken place and a conception that might otherwise occur may be prevented, I am not to be taken as accepting that that kind of treatment of a rape victim would be in conflict with either the letter or the spirit of the amendment. But there could be some hard cases where the 'treatment' sought would constitute abortion which conflicts both with existing law and with the proposed amendment. The question may, therefore, legitimately be asked whether what I have said amounts to saying that neither the law nor society can take account of hard cases no matter how heartrending they may be and that there can be no allowance for a woman who breaks this rigid law. Of course it does not mean that. The law forbids theft. It does not go on to say that allowances will be made for a person who is in serious need. Yet, in its practical operation and in its application by the courts, hard cases are catered for and one of the basic functions of the courts is to apply the law in a manner that takes account of all the relevant circumstances. This may not seem to some to be the ideal answer, and I can see their point of view. But, in practical terms, I suggest that it is either that or open the flood-gates. If leaders of religious groups put, on one side of the balance, a problem, which, however real, concerns what they surely accept as being a very small number of cases that they would be prepared to see as exceptions, and if they put on the other side of the balance the massive scale of abortion that is nowadays a feature of life over most of the known world, what conclusion can they reach as to which is the greater evil? There is only one remaining point that I think it necessary to deal with. That is the suggestion that a Constitution deals with general principles and not specifics, that a Constitution ought to be such as to be able in all its provisions to command the assent of all right-thinking citizens and that for those and other reasons it is undesirable that what is presented as a complex moral and social issue should be the subject of a constitutional provision rather than a legislative one. [1367] Some Constitutions set out only general principles. Ours is not one of that kind. It is entirely appropriate that such a basic right as the right to life of the unborn should be explicitly mentioned in it. There are specific references to many rights of much less importance. The suggestion that a Constitution should be such as to command the support of all right-thinking people for all its provisions is, I am afraid, unsustainable as a theory and wholly unattainable in practice. The Constitution's provisions on trade union membership are, for instance, criticised by some as giving too much freedom to unions and by others as unwisely restricting trade union activity. Both criticisms may be invalid but both cannot be valid. Likewise, provisions about, for instance, the right to own private property are criticised. Therefore, I do not think the proposition that a Constitution must in all respects command universal support is one that can be sustained. What of that point that the Constitution should not deal with complex moral and social issues? Certainly there are, within the general area of abortion problems, many issues that are complex in the moral and social sense, but the basic issue, to those who believe that pre-natal life is human life, is not complex. It is starkly simple and reduces itself to whether we as a society are willing to accept the introduction of the practice of induced abortion into our legal system. At the end of the day, there are only two possible answers to that basic question. One is 'yes'. The other is 'no'. I submit to the House that the answer ought to be 'no'. In commending the motion to the House — the motion that the Bill be now read a Second Time — I do so on the basis of what I have said earlier, namely, that in approving of the principle of the Bill, which is what the House does in giving a Bill a Second Reading, Deputies would not as far as I am concerned be committing themselves to the particular wording now proposed or any other particular form of wording but only to the [1368] principle which I think we all understand. On that basis, I recommend the Bill to the House.;2055003

Woods;Fianna Fáil;I find the Minister's speech extraordinary. It must be a precedent that he should come here and recommend to the House the principle of the Bill before us while obviously not having made up his mind about the Bill as a whole. He says that: In commending the motion to the [1372] House — the motion that the Bill be now read a Second Time — I do so on the basis of what I have said earlier, namely that, in approving of the principle of the Bill, which is what the House does in giving a Bill a Second Reading, Deputies would not, as far as I am concerned, be commiting themselves to the particular wording now proposed or any other particular form of wording but only to the principle which I think we all understand. We have had from the Minister a very much two-handed presentation. Repeatedly he has used the phrases, 'on the one hand' and 'on the other hand'. He has left everyone in total confusion as to his position in relation to the Bill. To say the least his presentation of Second Stage is very weak. This indicates a great doubt about the commitment of the Government and particularly of the Minister to the Bill. For all those who are interested in this legislation, this must be a bombshell. At the outset the Minister reminded us that the Labour Party will reserve the right to a free vote on this issue. We were fairly well aware of that but it looks now as if the Minister wishes to have a free vote on the issue also. One can only question whether Fine Gael are supporting the Bill. We have a situation in which not only the Cabinet are divided, as has been indicated clearly, but wherein the Taoiseach came into the House earlier and said that the Bill was being introduced with the collective agreement of the Cabinet purely to the Bill's introduction to the House, or, in effect, the reintroduction of a Bill that we introduced before leaving office. Obviously the collective responsibility has stopped very sharply at the point of the introduction of the Bill. We now have the Minister introducing a note of chaos into the debate on this very important Bill. This is most regrettable. In addition, the Minister has thrown in scare headlines by saying that questions have arisen as to whether the particular wording of the amendment could cause unforeseen difficulties. He says that on the one hand he has been advised that on one interpretation [1373] the amendment could have an effect very different from what it might appear at first sight to have and it could positively facilitate the introduction of abortion on a very wide scale. One can imagine the agony that that sort of statement from a responsible Minister will cause to people who are sincerely interested in the protection of the life of the unborn. The Minister went on to say that though that point has received some brief mention in print, it has not been widely made but is a point that must be seriously considered. Apparently the Minister does not himself believe in the point yet he raises it here by way of what I would regard as a major red herring and scare headline. The Minister went on to say that he thinks it right to emphasise that he is not saying that any of the interpretations to which he has referred would necessarily be upheld by the Supreme Court but that they had been put by responsible people as interpretations that could be supported by reasoned argument and that that might prevail. The Minister tells us that he is more than willing to listen with an open mind to anything said either inside or outside this House that will help to clarify the position.;2055010

Woods;Fianna Fáil;The Minister's leader was not fuzzy about the amendment during the run up to the election. He did not have any doubts about the matter. To prove the point I am making I will quote from a letter sent on 6 November 1982, that was after the election had been declared, to the pro-life amendment campaign people. The letter is from Fine Gael headquarters and is addressed to Ms. Julia Vaughan, Chairman, Pro-Life Amendment Campaign. It reads: Dear Dr. Vaughan, I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the statement which was issued as a [1374] result of a unanimous decision of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party following the publication of the draft amendment. As you will see, we are committed to introducing this amendment in Government and having it put to the people in a referendum before 31st March next. This referendum will not be delayed by any other consideration. This is an integral part of our programme and will be undertaken by any Government that I may have the responsibility of leading after the next General Election. May I add that the Party and myself are grateful for the very helpful discussion that you had with us on this subject recently. Yours sincerely, Garret FitzGerald.

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage.;09.02.83;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;In that case I have no other option but to respond. Unfortunately, I have not had a copy of the Minister's speech. Apparently the ushers ran out of them before they got this far. I am completely unprepared for speaking on this Bill this morning. Tairgim leasú Uimh. 1: Go scriosfar na focail go léir i ndiaidh 'Go' agus go gcuirfear an méid seo a leanas ina n-ionad: ndiúltaíonn Dáil Éireann an dara léamh a thabhairt don Bhille go dtí go bhfaighidh sí tuarascáil ar an mBille ó Chomhchoiste den Dáil agus den Seanad ag a mbeidh cumhacht fios a chur ar dhaoine, ar pháipéir agus ar thaifid. I move amendment No. 1: To delete all words after 'That' and substitute the following: Dáil Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill until it receives a report on the Bill from a [1369] Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad, having powers to send for persons, papers and records. I consider that what the Minister had to say this morning, except for the last paragraph, was an attempt to ride two horses, to appear to support the amendment which the Government have brought in and at the same time to indicate that the Bill was not an attempt to force individuals or people at large to accept a denominational clause in the Constitution. I note that during his speech he did not attempt at any stage to define what he meant by abortion. He spoke about life commencing at conception. Prior to that he said it would be sterile to try to discuss if we were talking about human life, human beings or whatever. I submit to the Minister that a discussion on these very questions is most important. The question of when the Anglican Church or the Catholic Church are talking about life at conception, the form of that life, whether it is a human life or a human being, is a very important point. If we got 166 theologians in here instead of 166 TDs I believe we would get 166 different opinions as to when life commences and whether it is human life or otherwise. I have said a number of times outside the House that I consider this amendment to be a sectarian one. I consider it to be an attempt by a small group of people, who took advantage of a delicate political situation. At a time when the major political parties were looking for every single vote they could find, a small group of people grasped this opportunity and unfortunately the leaders of the two major political parties agreed, on the spur of the moment, to an amendment which will have far-reaching consequences, much more than appears on the surface at the present time. We have put down an amendment to this Bill asking that the matter be referred to an all-party committee. The reason for that is that I feel there is a need for everybody in the House to sit down calmly, out of the glare of publicity, and to tease through all the legal, theological and medical implications of the proposal [1370] before us today. We are talking about an amendment to the Constitution which, as the Minister said, deals with the question of life. We are attempting to deal with that today in a couple of hours. At the same time, the Dáil has on numerous occasions, over a period of 20 years or more, referred other questions, questions which were not so important, to committees of the Dáil. They have sat on them and discussed the matter year after year and brought forward recommendations. But the Dáil, because it was unsure, failed to proceed with the amendment to the Constitution which was recommended. I suggest that this particular amendment is far more important than anything which has come before the Dáil on three previous occasions and, for that reason, I strongly recommend that the amendment put down by The Workers' Party to this Bill be supported by the majority of the Deputies in the House. The question of whether the amendment will prevent the use of certain contraceptives is an important issue which was not dealt with by the Minister. He indicated that in his view the Bill would not prevent the administration or prescribing of a morning-after pill in rape cases. That brings us back to the question of whether the life referred to is a life from the point of conception. I feel it is an indication that the matters which the Minister referred to have not been fully thought through. He talks about abortion on demand and he indicates that nobody in the House wants abortion on demand. He does not talk about the exceptions which the Roman Catholic Church allow where pregnancies can be terminated in two specific circumstances. Presumably, from the terms of the speech the Minister made, he does not regard the exceptions allowed by the Catholic Church for abortions, but they are terminations of pregnancies. They are induced abortions. The Minister claims that this Bill is to prevent induced abortions. I feel that the Dáil would be far better served at this stage if it accepted the amendment put down by The Workers' Party in order to allow quite a detailed study of the implications so that we are not saddled with a sectarian clause in our Constitution and that the [1371] political development, not only of this State but of the island as a whole, will not be stunted in any way. The Taoiseach is on record as being anxious to engage in a constitutional crusade with a view to making our Constitution more acceptable to people in Northern Ireland who are not inclined to agree to a united Ireland. Despite what the Minister has said, the generality of people and certainly those who are not Roman Catholic are very strongly of the view that the inclusion of this amendment in the Constitution will render that document even more sectarian than it is already. As I had not expected to be involved in this debate until near the end, I shall not speak further at this stage.;2055018

62;Financial Resolutions, 1983. - An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht (Colscaradh), 1983: Cead Tabhairt Isteach. (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Divorce) Bill, 1983: Leave to;15.02.83;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;I would like to say how short five minutes is to deal with such an important question as divorce. It is fairly clear to most Deputies that there is a growing need for divorce legislation in this State. There is a growing body of statistics indicating that marital breakdown [202] is on the increase. It does no credit to this House if we continue to ignore this problem. Marital breakdown is a fact of life and the ban on divorce does nothing to protect family life. It simply aggravates the distress of those who find themselves in this situation — the mother, father and children of the marriage. In accepting this Bill the House would not be committing itself to any precise form of divorce legislation. It would simply enable the House to get down to discussing what type of divorce is required and which would best suit the conditions in this State. The 1967 all-party committee recommended that the constitutional ban on divorce should be removed. For that reason alone, it is pointless referring this aspect of the problem to an all-party committee. If the House agrees that this Bill should proceed to the next stage, it would enable Deputies to express their views on this very important topic and to say precisely what kind of divorce legislation is needed. In the brief time available to me I would like to mention a number of anomalies that exist under the present situation. Irish people domiciled abroad who get divorces abroad, have those divorces recognised in this State and if they remarry in this State their marriages are recognised as legal. On the other hand there are, I believe, approximately 3,000 marriages in this State which have been annulled by the Roman Catholic Church and when the people involved in this type of situation remarry they are considered by law to be living in a bigamous marriage. On the other hand, the Revenue Commissioners recognise as legitimate the claim by persons involved in a so-called bigamous situation and recognise them as man and wife for the purpose of tax allowances and so on. Clearly that is a very unsatisfactory situation. Because of a lack of a clear position on this question we have desertions which are running into thousands. There are 15,000 applications for desertion allowances, mostly from women because of the anomaly in the social welfare code and there are 6,000 in receipt of the deserted wife's allowances. [203] It is pointless for us to continue to ignore a problem that exists. In view of the fact that many Deputies from all parties have indicated that they consider this matter should be dealt with, I appeal to the parties to allow a free vote tonight. I appeal particularly to the Labour Party who in their recent election manifesto 'called for family law reform including civil divorce for marriages irretrievably broken down'. Apart from the Labour Party I appeal to all Deputies to allow this Bill to proceed. In conclusion I hope Deputies will consider this Bill in the light of the great human suffering of all concerned in marriages that have broken down. I appeal to everyone to take the position that we can no longer bury our heads in the sand. We must recognise that this problem exists, and if this House is to have any relevance we must sit down and tackle it.;2056436
63;Financial Resolutions, 1983. - An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht (Colscaradh), 1983: Cead Tabhairt Isteach. (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Divorce) Bill, 1983: Leave to;15.02.83;F;Ms. Nuala Fennell;Fine Gael;The Government are opposing the granting of leave to introduce this Bill. The Dáil will be aware that the Programme for Government provides for the setting up of an all-party Oireachtas committee which will examine and make recommendations on the problems of the protection of marriage under modern conditions and of marriage breakdown and on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required. The committee's deliberations must necessarily include consideration of the constitutional prohibition on divorce, and the Taoiseach already made this abundantly clear to the Dáil on 26 January 1983 in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy De Rossa. I believe that there is a common concern among Deputies with the increasing incidence of marital breakdown and the overwhelming burden of distress and human misery it causes. It is, however, clear that no political consensus has yet emerged on how best to deal with the problem in a way which properly balances the interests of individuals, both adults and children, with the interest of society as a whole. [204] Marriages break down — and some of them break down irretrievably. This is a sad fact of life, and the main purpose of the all-party committee will be to consider how best the State can support marriage and the family, which all of us, in the words of the Constitution, recognise as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society. To the extent that we can identify how the resources of the State should be mobilised in support of marriage and the family, this will be our primary aim. Without anticipating the findings of the committee anyone concerned with the problem will certainly be aware of the need for greater emphasis on marriage counselling — and this is an area where State support might be improved. I hope it will be possible for the committee to arrive at a consensus as to how the marriage laws should be reformed in present-day circumstances. The issues involved are very important to the type of society in which we live and we will have to consider them openly and honestly. The proposed terms of reference of the committee are at present being drawn up, and the Taoiseach has expressed the hope that it will be possible to get all-party agreement in this regard. I believe it is essential that Deputies on all sides come together to see how best we should deal with the problem of marriage breakdown. No party can claim a moral prerogative which enables them to ignore this issue — the people who elect us are entitled to expect that we would at least have the courage to look at the contemporary difficulties of society.;2056437

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;F;Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn;Fianna Fáil;I take a tremendous [495] interest in anything Deputy Kelly has to say about the legal system because he is very fair. I take issue with the Minister for Health when he states: It is abundantly clear that any attempt to change the law in this regard would meet, rightly, with the overwhelming opposition of Irish society, not least as reflected in the membership of this House. I question how any attempt could meet with the overwhelming opposition of Irish society. There could well be marches and protests but if abortion becomes legal as a result of a decision of the Supreme Court it will be too late to do anything about it. Some people may say this might not happen. Speaking on Wednesday last, 9 February, Deputy John Kelly said: Naturally lawyers will differ: they could not live if they did not differ and my opinion is no better than that of the next lawyer. However, I want to state my opinion in so far as a judgment of a future likelihood is an opinion. I think there is not the smallest chance that Chief Justice O'Higgins, Mr. Justice Walsh, Mr. Justice Griffin, Mr. Justice Hederman and Mr. Justice McCarthy will at any time interfere with or strike down the old legislation which penalises abortion. That is a guess based on observing the Supreme Court at work, which is my special interest and hobby. In so far as I can measure these judges — and I know them personally — there is not the slightest chance of it happening. I cannot foresee what a generation of judges will do 30 or 50 years from now. I concede freely to the Pro-Life Amendment Group and the other groups who take a very sincere and understandable interest in the matter that they are quite right in saying that public opinion here can change rapidly, and has in fact changed rapidly. The McGee case which was decided in 1973 most certainly would not have been so decided 20 years previously. If the Supreme Court had been asked in 1953 to strike down that section of the Criminal Law [496] (Amendment) Act, 1935, one would have been laughed out of court. One would have found it difficult to get solicitor and counsel even to raise such a case. I would not like to be positive about what might have happened had it been raised in 1963. If one were lucky with one's High Court judge — I will not mention names — the High Court in 1963 might have made a decision similar to that made by the Supreme Court in 1973. However, I would not like to guess whether it would have got through the Supreme Court at that time. I admit freely that the climate of opinion changes, and that that is a very good instance of changing opinion which was reflected in the judgment of a court. Having listened to Deputy Kelly last week and read his contribution on numerous occasions since, it appears that he feels, as most of us do, that Irish constitutional law has developed to such a stage where the outcome of a constitutional challenge to the present legal prohibition on abortion cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. It must be clear that the only way to make certain that abortion does not become legal in Ireland in the coming years is to write into the Constitution an amendment which reinforces the existing law against abortion. Many people have asked if the EEC could impose abortion legislation here. Would this not require a change in the Treaty of Rome, something which could only take place with the unanimous agreement of member states? We could veto any such proposal. In the case of the European Court of Human Rights about which we have heard so much, decrees of that court cannot override the Irish Constitution if they conflict with it, or can they? If those facts are true then they surely represent another reason for the inclusion in our Constitution of a clear statement of the right to life of the unborn which no Parliament, or court, here or elsewhere can change in any way. In November 1982 Fianna Fáil in Government proposed the following amendment to the Constitution: 'The [497] State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.' That wording was endorsed by Deputy Garret FitzGerald, leader of Fine Gael when in Opposition. He promised that if elected to Government he would accept the same wording and hold the referendum before 31 March 1983. In the course of a letter to the Pro-Life Amendment Group, dated 6 Novemeber 1982, he said that as a result of a unanimous decision of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party — perhaps the Ceann Comhairle, a member of the parliamentary party at that time, can confirm this — they were committed to introducing this amendment in Government and having it put to the people before 31 March next. He said that this referendum would not be delayed by any other consideration. In an interview on the RTE programme, 'Today Tonight', on 4 November 1982, Deputy FitzGerald said that before endorsing the wording he had taken legal advice on it and he thought it was the best amendment 'we could get'. I should like to inquire if that legal advice came from the person who is now Attorney General. Every person expected that that solemn promise by Deputy FitzGerald would be kept. The wording had been approved by the legal advisers to the last Government and by the legal advice given to the Taoiseach when he accepted it last November. Claims have been voiced lately that the amendment could somehow bring in abortion but they are spurious claims. The suspicion that it is all a ploy to discredit the acceptable wording and, indeed, to bring in what might be termed as weaker wording cannot be ruled out. It would be sad if abortion came to Ireland through the deliberate tardiness of a Government already solemnly pledged to bring in the pro-life amendment. Let us look at the sequence of events since November. What has happened since then? Deputy FitzGerald has been elected Taoiseach and he has had to weld [498] together a party which includes conservatives, intellectuals, liberals and, perhaps for the first time in his political career — I make that statement in the best sense — he is faced with having to make a decision which will alienate some of his party colleagues and supporters. Hence we have a plethora of systematic knockout punches to the amendment prepared by Fianna Fáil and accepted by Fine Gael in Opposition. Is it a coincidence that one liberal Fine Gael Deputy was the first to voice concern about the amendment, that hours later he was followed by Labour colleagues, including members of the Cabinet, and that this public relations exercise was compounded by the statement of the Minister of Justice followed by what are confused and muddled legal opinions of the Attorney General? The most serious aspect of it as far as I am concerned — I imagine it concerns the Chair as a legal person — is that the Minister and the Attorney General——;2057488

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Dr. Rory O'Hanlon;Fianna Fáil;Since last week when the debate was adjourned there have been statements from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. These have added to the confusion about this Bill. Yesterday there was a highly selective version of the Attorney General's advice published in The Irish Times and I will be dealing with that later. It has been stated: In addition the proposal would not permit an abortion to prevent serious injury to the physical or mental well being of the mother as distinct from her death. Although such abortions are not permissible under existing legislation the effect of the amendment would be to close off the possibility of the Oireachtas even considering that they might be permissible in some circumstances. That is exactly the type of situation which [461] the amendment is supposed to close off. Virtually all abortion Acts in the western world allow abortion on the basis of serious injury to the physicial and mental well-being of the mother. In many western countries, for example, the United Kingdom, that has in effect become abortion on demand. The Presbyterian Church in Ireland have issued a document on abortion which states: We have already seen that the provision for abortion for these reasons has been grossly abused. It is not easy to prove to what extent health, particularly mental health, is at risk. Ninety per cent of abortions in Britain were performed in 1979 for reasons of the mental health of the mother or risk to her existing children. It is clear from this extract that one of the reasons for the Attorney General's objection — perhaps the real reason — is that it would effectively prevent the introduction of abortion in Ireland. Also appearing in The Irish Times was the statement that an alternative wording had been presented to the Government by the Attorney General. The wording was stated to be as follows: The Oireachtas may, by its law, prohibit the practice of abortion, and no provision of this Constitution shall be regarded as conferring any right to have an abortion. That would be unacceptable to us because one of the principles in this Bill is that the people by way of referendum should have the final choice if abortion is ever to be introduced here. If we were to accept that wording it would mean that the Oireachtas could at some time introduce abortion and that the 1861 Act could be amended in the Dáil without a referendum. That wording would not constitute a pro-life amendment. My party fail to understand the change in attitude in Fine Gael. Perhaps it has something to do with being in Government or with the attitude of the Labour Party. The Taoiseach was very emphatic about his position and nowhere more so than during an interview with Brian Farrell [462] on RTE's 'Today Tonight' on 4 November 1982. He stated: When the formula was produced we were pleasantly surprised because we had feared that it would be a negative kind of formula which would attempt to lay down the conditions in which abortion should be illegal and you get into problems of definition there. What we had proposed, and I pressed this very strongly in my Ard Fheis speech, was that it should be literally a pro-life amendment which would strengthen the protection of life, the life of the unborn, and I was very relieved the amendment took that form. I feared it might take the other form and when we examined it carefully and saw the wording of it and took advice on it, it seemed to us that it was about as good a formula as you could get. I have to admit that in the Government's favour. Later in that interview he said: I think it is the best amendment you can get and it seems sensible to say so in those circumstances. I fail to understand why there is such a change of attitude now. It is extraordinary that the opinions coming before us now did not come over the last three months. When the Bill was brought before the House last week for a Second Reading there were doubts of this nature. It was obvious from this side of the House last week that there was confusion on the Government benches. The pro-life amendment is all about the most fundamental right, the right to life. There have been arguments that there has been no need for a change in the Constitution or to add this amendment to it but if one looks at Article 40 of the Constitution, which deals with the right of the citizen, one will see it does not refer to the unborn child. Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, an Irish citizen is defined as a person born in Ireland, which in effect means that the right that we have comes after we are born and not before. It is obvious that in 1937 there was no need to put a protection for the unborn into the Constitution because at that time it was never envisaged that Governments would legalise [463] abortion. The 1861 Act makes abortion illegal and it is interesting to note that that Act is still the law in England but there has been a holocaust of abortions in that country in the last 15 years — more than two million to date. The 1967 Act merely exempts a doctor from culpability under the 1861 Act if two doctors, acting in good faith, believe that a woman should have an abortion. That is the reason why the wording suggested in The Irish Times that might be put forward to give the power to the Oireachtas would be unacceptable. There is no doubt that at the time the 1961 Act was introduced in the UK it was not intended that there would be abortion on demand but it is accepted that there are doctors who are prepared to carry out abortion on demand there. In December last efforts were made in the House of Lords to amend the Act to bring it more into line with the intention of the sponsors of the Bill when it was first introduced. The courts here could decide that the 1861 Act was unconstitutional. While that is highly unlikely at present, nevertheless it is a possibility in the future. If one wants to consider how long that might be one has only to look at the American situation. There was no political movement in America before 1968 for the repeal of the abortion laws but in that year the lobby started. After two years they were able to overthrow a 140-year-old law that prohibited abortion in New York city and in 1973, five years later, in the case of Roe v. Wade the right to privacy was extended to include the termination of a pregnancy. Within five years of the start of the lobby abortion was legalised in the US. It is also interesting to note that in every country where contraception was legalised the lobby commenced immediately afterwards for abortion. In many countries abortion is used as an alternative, particularly in women over 40, as, if one might term it so, a means of contraception in other words, the women do not take any precaution and have an abortion later. The Oireachtas could amend the 1861 Act to allow abortion. That is an alternative to the courts declaring [464] that Act unconstitutional. It is fair to ask this question: what would be more democratic now than to give our people the right in a referendum to decide this issue? Doctor Natheson, one of the promoters of abortion on a large scale in the US visited Ireland last November and he stated that he had turned very much against abortion. He was anxious to see a new amendment to the Constitution in the US and he made it clear that the pro-life groups in Ireland should learn from the American experience and campaign for the passing of an amendment to our Constitution before abortion is imposed upon us. The medical profession have a long history of working with unconditional respect for human life. That goes back more than 2,000 years, before Christianity, to the time of Hippocrates. The hippocratic oath states that nothing should be given to cause an abortion. The World Medical Association in the declaration of Geneva in 1948 called on all doctors to maintain respect for human life from the time of conception even under threat and not to use their knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity. The two major medical organisations here, the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union, although it may not have been within their general terms of reference to discuss such matters, at their annual general meetings both passed unanimous resolutions condemning abortion because of the strong feelings in the profession against abortion. In the past 15 years a number of countries have assumed the power to take the life of the unborn child through their abortion laws. The role of doctors has been extended. Indeed, in some countries it is obligatory for them to take this life. Abortion is not and should not be a medical problem. It is a social problem. Life starts in some form at conception. At that time it is fair to say it is human life with potential rather than potentially human. At 12 weeks the infant is fully formed with discernible eyes, ears, face, limbs. Sir William Lily, an expert in the study of unborn children said: [465] We know the infant is responsive in the womb to touch and light, to sound and to stimuli which you and I would consider painful. A number of arguments have been made against the amendment many of them on the basis that we should have abortion in some circumstances, for example, when there is concern that the mother's life is put at risk to save the child. I should like to come back to the Attorney General's statement reported in The Irish Times yesterday. Under the heading 'With due regard to the equal right to life of the mother' he said: If a doctor were to be faced with the choice as to saving the life of one, and thereby terminating the life of the other, then I believe that the only lawful conclusion to this dilemma would be that he could do nothing, absolutely nothing, which infringed on either right. It is only where there is no possibility of the foetus surviving, even without the doctor's intervention, that no difficulty will arise. I will leave legal comments on the Attorney General's statement to those who are qualified to make them, but I would have to say, in my opinion as a medical doctor, that that paragraph is rubbish. I am absolutely sure, knowing my colleagues, that there is no situation in which a doctor would stand by and do nothing, or absolutely nothing, whatever the difference is. Doctors are not confronted with the sort of situations where they have to sit down and study what action they will take in a particular case. Medical ethics are based on the natural law with due regard to the equal rights of mother and infant. A doctor would never have to say: 'I will save one life and I will let the other go.' The type of cases which have been mentioned by those who are opposed to the amendment are very rare, for example, where a woman has cancer of the womb. Cancer of the womb in a pregnant woman is a very rare condition. Where it does occur, if it is necessary for the womb to be removed, it will be removed. If the woman needs radiotherapy she will have radiotherapy. The fact [466] that there is a pregnancy in the womb does not mean there is an abortion, because there is no intent on the part of the doctor to merely kill the child in the womb. The doctor's intent is to remove the cancerous womb. The same can be said about ectopic pregnancy, a pregnancy outside the womb. It is possible that in years gone by there were medical conditions which might have caused problems for the woman who had such a pregnancy. Nowadays with modern medical treatment that would be extremely rare. Professor O'Driscoll and Dr. Murphy of the National Maternity Hospital studied 74,317 deliveries in the National Maternity Hospital and found that 21 women died during pregnancy in that period. There was no case where they could say abortion would have saved the mother. They published their work which was a very detailed study, in the Irish Medical Journal of August 1982. I should like to quote from one paragraph in that article: The final conclusion is that therapeutic abortion would have had no beneficial effect on maternal mortality in this hospital during the seventies and, by analogy, women do not die in childbirth because therapeutic abortion is not practised in Ireland today. From my own experience as a medical practitioner, from what I have read in literature and from what I know from my colleagues, I do not believe it is necessary to introduce abortion for the medical cases which are quoted by those who are against the amendment because they want abortion legalised. Rape is another case in question. However, it is very rare for a woman to become pregnant as a result of rape. There have been various studies carried out and the general consensus seems to be that, on average, one woman in 500 who is raped becomes pregnant. That would mean it would be a very rare occurence and years would go by without any woman becoming pregnant. If abortion was made legal for women who had been [467] raped it is possible that a woman could come along to her doctor and say she had been raped, even though that was not the case, in order to procure an abortion. It would be very difficult for the medical profession to decide in a case like that. I believe it would open the door to abortion on demand. While, obviously, one must have compassion for the victims of rape, if they go along quickly enough to their doctor or to the outpatients' department, something can be done to prevent them becoming pregnant under the present law without any infringement of that law, by way of contraception, which is not abortion. It is interesting to note that Dr. Alec Byrne, who was before the UK courts in 1938 for carrying out an abortion on a girl who was raped, was opposed to the 1967 Act when it was introduced. Some people believe that an abortion should be available to a woman whose unborn child is severely handicapped. That has already been dealt with by my colleague, Deputy Woods, and, from my own experience of working with the handicapped, I see no reason why they should be denied the right to life. Many of them have made a valuable contribution to our society in the field of literature, art and science. It has also been suggested that the amendment would ban contraception. The amendment will not change the existing law. It has been argued that some of the present contraceptives act as abortifacients, for example, the intra-uterine device. Nobody can say in any given case how that device works, whether it is working as a contraceptive, an abortifacient or not working at all, because it is possible for a woman to become pregnant and come to her full term with the intra uterine device inserted. Again it is a question of intent. It is hard to see how, under existing laws, anybody could be charged as a result of using an intra-uterine device. As the law will not change when the amendment is added to the Constitution, then the question will not arise. There is also an argument that the woman should have the right to choose [468] and the freedom to control her own fertility. There is no such right in our law and, therefore, the amendment cannot diminish or interfere with a right that does not exist. It is important to point out that the unborn child is not a part of its mother's body but a unique individual with the same, fundamental right to life as any other person. It is true that the pro-life amendment will not stop women going abroad for an abortion but I hope the debate here and the amendment to the Constitution, when carried, will force the Government and society to take a more enlightened and positive attitude towards those women who find themselves forced by social pressures to have abortions. I also hope there will be a positive attempt to prevent discrimination against the unmarried mother as a result of this amendment. There should be a build-up of support services for those who need them, for example, financial help, emotional support, medical services and whatever other support is necessary so that these women will be able to continue their pregnancies happy in the knowledge that they will have their baby without any fears or guilt. It has been suggested that the amendment is sectarian, that it represents the Roman Catholic stance. It is hard to understand this argument although churchmen seem to have varying views on this. Nevertheless, it has been suggested as a reason why we should not proceed with the amendment. It is important to state once again that the amendment is about a basic human right — the right to life — which transcends all religious views. It is the same for an agnostic as it is for a member of any religion. It is no harm to note that the 1861 Act was brought in by a British Parliament and nobody has stated that it was sectarian. When the amendment is introduced into the Constitution it will not change the 1861 Act. It is difficult to understand the argument that it is in some way sectarian. As a member of a union affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions it came as a surprise and a disappointment to me to find that the executive were opposed to the pro-life amendment. I [469] would have expected that in proper democratic fashion they would have been anxious to give the people the opportunity to decide for themselves if they wished to have an amendment to the Constitution. The cost of holding the referendum should not be an issue. That cost is estimated at £750,000 but most of that money will give employment on polling day and to the printers. In my view the money will be well spent. I believe that when the people get an opportunity they will vote to write into the Constitution an amendment that will protect the life of the unborn. I cannot accept the suggestion that the amendment would make this State less acceptable to the Unionists in Northern Ireland. I know the Northern people and I believe they would be much impressed by this part of Ireland being prepared to stand up for the most fundamental of human rights than if we were carried away by the rising tide of liberalism that has beset western civilisation. The Reverend Sydney Garland, President of Life, speaking on behalf of a number of Protestant Churches in Northern Ireland, made it clear that he positively welcomed the amendment and he rejected the suggestion that it was sectarian. I should like to quote the Reverend Ian Paisley, Moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church, and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, when he spoke last November on the subject of abortion. He said: 'Life is a gift from God and no one has the right to take it away except the giver, whether that life is in the womb or in the world.' It is also significant that the Reverend Ian Paisley, Jim Molyneaux and others were vehemently opposed to the extension of the 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland. It is important that the Fianna Fáil position on the amendment be quite clear. We do not want any postponement of this legislation. It was not Fianna Fáil who stated that the referendum would be held before 31 March. We want the legislation through the House as expeditiously as possible. Fianna Fáil believe the wording we put forward is correct and nothing that has been said has convinced us that we should alter that view. [470] Having regard to numerous statements by the Taoiseach, particularly his interview with Brian Farrell on the 'Today Tonight' programme, and also to statements by the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, one might ask why at this stage, having circulated the Bill, is there any question of change? We should get a speedy answer to that question. Do Fine Gael and/or Labour want a pro-life amendment? As I said earlier, some of what has been suggested as an alternative would not be pro-life. Are we witnessing an orchestrated move to prevent the amendment? We are entitled to answers to these questions. In May 1981 before the Taoiseach formed his first Coalition Government he promised he would introduce the necessary legislation to bring forward the referendum on such an amendment. We know that when in Government at that time he distanced himself from his promise and he went off on a constitutional crusade. Before the last general election he promised again to introduce the amendment and it was he who stated the referendum would be held before 31 March. During the motion on Dáil reform there were many references to this House and the perception of the public with regard to this House. I am concerned that the credibility of the House and the Government — not the credibility of Fianna Fáil who have taken a consistent stand on this matter — and particularly the credibility of the Taoiseach is at stake here. He should gather his courage, honour his commitment, hold the referendum on the wording presented and give the people an opportunity in the most democratic way to enshrine protection for the unborn child in our Constitution.;2057490

As a person who does not have legal qualifications I should like to ask the Taoiseach, or whoever wishes to reply, if the Director of Public Prosecutions has a role to play in this matter or if he is only making a statement at the instigation of the Government. The striking feature of the statements of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions is that they have helped only to further confuse an already confused situation. Take the statement by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the present wording could make it difficult for him to institute prosecutions. When the Minister is replying, perhaps he could clarify for me whether prosecutions by the Director of Public Prosecutions are instituted under the Constitution or under the law. I do not want to believe that the Government — and I certainly do not believe it of the majority of the Deputies in Fine Gael — are embarking on a sophisticated scuttling of this amendment. They do not accept our wording. They know what they are about to propose will be unacceptable. Therefore, one has to ask the question: What then? The Government are assured of the full support of Fianna Fáil for the present wording of the amendment. The last thing this country wants now, or at any time in the future, is to make a political football out of a tremendously genuine desire on the part of the vast majority of the people to enshrine in our Constitution a simple but unassailable right to life of the unborn.;2057500
83;An Bille Um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Joseph (Joe) Doyle;Fine Gael;I am concerned about the emotional atmosphere which has been generated outside this House on the [500] debate on the proposed amendment to the Constitution and the very considerable fear that anyone who expresses opposition to it is branded an abortionist. I regret that this should be happening and I want to dissociate myself from it. I also regret the method by which this amendment has been brought before the House. It is wrong that at election time, groups, no matter how well-intentioned their motives are, should pressurise political parties into entering into an agreement to change our constitutional law. My colleague, Deputy Kelly, dealt at length and very well with that point. I fully concur with what he said. People who support the anti-amendment campaign say they are not expressing a view either for or against abortion. I trust that those who are opposed to the amendment will respect my views in the same way as I respect theirs. This is my first address to this House and I speak on this Bill from a very deep personal conviction about the dignity and value of human life. Human life begins in the womb and must be protected and respected from there on until death. I speak on my own behalf and on behalf of the majority of the Irish people. For me the issue is a simple one. The unborn should have the same right to life as the born. In the amendment the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and guarantees to defend and vindicate that right. Respect for life at all stages is not only a Christian principle but also a human principle. Respect for life is engraved in the heart of man, in his conscience and in his sense of personal responsibility. In taking a stand for the sacred character and absolute rights of the unborn, a person is at one with the deepest convictions of the human conscience. It is my belief that the embryo foetus possesses a fundamental right to life from the moment of conception. From that moment the foetus is already provided with all the genetic elements which will shape its future development as an adult person. As Deputy O'Hanlon said this morning, this is more than a potential human being it is already a human being with potential, complete with every [501] genetic detail, unique, individual and unrepeatable. People who support abortion speak as if the unborn had no rights. The United Nations Organisation in 1959 declared that the child, because of its mental and physical immaturity, needs special care and safeguards, including legal safeguards, before as well as after birth. One of those involved in the test tube baby experiments said that in crushing unwanted embryos he was conscious of destroying human life. Protection for unborn life should be part of society's whole commitment to the improvement of the quality of human life. There is a strange contrast in modern society between, on the one hand, the genuine compassion which lies behind the movements to abolish capital punishment and to ban nuclear arms and, on the other hand, the killing of the unborn. A responsible caring society must say yes to human life at all stages, and safeguard and improve the quality of that life. The question has been asked: is this amendment sectarian? Because the majority of the Irish people are Catholics and the Church anti-abortion and pro-life, some people can easily label the present amendment as being sectarian and divisive. They argue that it offends against the principles of pluralism. The principles of pluralism are valid and must be respected in many cases. The question is: is abortion a case in which pluralism can be applied? The pluralistic thesis on abortion does not seek to argue that particular attitudes towards abortion by various denominations of people are right or wrong. It holds that the law should not select between different views but allow them all to be held, that those who consider abortion to be right are free to have an abortion while those who consider it to be wrong are not free to have an abortion. The difficulty with this approach is that the right to choose abortion is at the expense of denying the unborn the right to life. A pluralistic society can be neutral about many things but it cannot be neutral about fundamental rights. In protecting the rights of the unborn the State is not being sectarian. The present legislation [502] prohibiting abortion could be challenged at any time on the basis that it offends against pluralism. While it would appear that the Constitution guards the right to life of citizens or persons, the attitude of the Constitution to the unborn is not clear. Could it be maintained that at present the unborn have no legal rights, no legal existence and are constitutionally unprotected? The answer to that question is yes. For that reason it is necessary to ensure that the unborn are no longer exposed to that risk. In dealing with the text of the amendment, I wish to make it clear that I do not believe any form of wording is sacrosanct. If the wording proposed by the previous Government, and accepted by the present Government, is defective, we must change it to ensure that the purpose of the amendment is achieved. On the other hand, I wish to be clearly identified as someone who will not countenance the abandonment of the principle of a constitutional prohibition on abortion under a smokescreen of manufactured doubts. Two major questions are raised about the proposed wording. First it is suggested that the word 'equal' when applied to the mother's right to life may cause difficulties of interpretation. For my part, to say one person's right to life is equal to that of another is meaningless except in so far as we are all held equal before the law. The right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is always circumscribed by circumstances such as the right to self-defence which may permit the ending of one life in order to protect the life of another or others. The same choice may sometimes have to be made in gynaecology. To suggest that the rights are equal means very little, if anything, especially in circumstances where preserving one life can end the life of another. I would prefer to let the phrase 'the right to life of the mother' stand on its own without qualification. The second objection is the lack of clarity in the word 'unborn'. This has been described as an adjective and unnecessarily ambiguous. I cannot accept that it is necessary to add a noun to this adjective. If the phrase means to cover all stages of development, from conception [503] to birth, it would be ungainly to qualify it by a phrase like 'the embryo', 'foetus' or 'child'. If every stage from the fertilised ovum to fully developed child before birth is correctly termed 'unborn' then it seems to be a suitable phrase. I also suggest that the word 'unborn' might mean capable of being born and thus restrict the protection offered by the amendment to a viable foetus. I am advised there is no foundation for such a view. Subject to the deletion of the word 'equal', a legal novelty which gives rise to some misgivings and concern, the amendment should stay much the same as it is. Another matter of grave importance is the suggestion that an alternative wording should be sought which would restrict the Supreme Court in its interpretative role in this area but which would leave the hands of legislators unfettered. Any amendment which begins with the phrase 'no court shall ...' or similar words might let the Supreme Court down while allowing this House to alter the law without reference to the people. If this is the kind of amendment being contemplated, I should warn its proponents that I would find it unacceptable. Anyone who knows the real value of social conditions will be well aware that the mere passing of an amendment to the Constitution is unlikely to materially affect the rights of the unborn. No amendment can save a life or improve the lives of our children. The legislation of abortion, either by legislation or court decision, could cost many lives. To do justice to the illegitimate child — a phrase which I dislike using — much more than an amendment to the Constitution is necessary. The stigma of illegitimacy must be removed and the prejudice of centuries which termed the child filius nullius, the child of nobody, must be overcome. We are no better than latter day Mr. Bumbles if we beat our breasts regarding abortion and yet allow illegitimate children to be branded as second class citizens. Charles Dickens found many people in Victorian society who combined an air of morality with an attitude of indifference. I cannot help feeling that [504] the passing of 150 years has made very little difference. A campaign to protect the unborn is futile unless it marks the commencement of a revolution in our attitudes towards those born out of wedlock. There must be a clear and unambiguous acceptance of the recent proposals of the Law Reform Commission to this end. The stigma of illegitimacy must be removed as soon as possible and I was glad to hear the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, in this regard. Anyone who urges commitment to the amendment, without a similar commitment to caring for and giving equal treatment to the child born out of wedlock, does not deserve an audience. It is alleged that the present amendment, if passed, will not stop the traffic to England of those who seek abortions outside the State and will not stop other abuses connected with abortion. The argument, if true, should not prevent the need for a constitutional declaration on the rights of the unborn. Those who are deeply opposed to abortion are saddened by the number of Irish girls who go each year to England to have pregnancies terminated. This is caused by the irresponsible attitude of many Irish people in their personal relationships and I regret that the male population have a great responsibility in this matter. This amendment highlights the need for individuals, families, churches of all denominations, local communities, local authorities and the State to be much more supportive, compassionate and caring towards those with difficult or unwanted pregnancies — especially the unmarried mother who may see abortion as the only solution to their great distress. The amendment enshrines a principle shared by the great majority of the people. The deletion of the word 'equal' which I regard as ambiguous, would remove the genuine obstacle to acceptability. I urge this House to proceed with the debate in order to place this worthy constitutional reform, amended as I have suggested, before the people at the earliest possible time.;2057501

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;F;Ms. Eileen Lemass;Fianna Fáil;The Minister for Health, in his statement, gave the following as [505] one of the reasons why he is against this amendment: In this case, however, I have to say that in my view the extensive, considered and dispassionate debate in the community as a whole which should precede any initiative to amend our Constitution, has not taken place. In all my time as a public representative, I have never come across any debate so extensive or intensive as this, so I do not think that the Minister for Health is right when he says that a debate has not taken place. The only curtailment that might have been put on this debate was when the Government stated, about two weeks ago, that it would get only one day in this House. Deputies in Fianna Fáil were very disturbed about that statement but subsequently, apparently for various reasons, it was changed and the debate was allowed to continue. I am very saddened and discouraged at present by what is happening because of the disagreement within the Coalition Parties. They obviously have come to the conclusion, in very recent times, that they want to change the words as they are. We all know that the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, gave his full commitment to it. those words. He had legal advice at that time and he was fully committed to it. Why, one day, is he fully committed to the words and, shortly afterwards, totally against them? The whole debate is becoming more divisive and it is causing much trauma and uncertainty among people. It is most unfortunate that the Government did not honour their commitment to go ahead with the pro-life amendment as worded. Those who say the amendment was not necessary and that it should not have been started in the first place are partially right. Had the discussion not occurred the legislation we have would protect the unborn to a certain degree. Up to two years ago there was no real demand for this amendment, but at the moment the situation is such that it must go ahead because of the discussions that have taken place. The people must be given [506] the opportunity to vote in the referendum. Bringing into the discussion medical and legal argument as well as the churches has been divisive. I am perturbed for a number of people in the Protestant churches who have been labelled, whether pro- or anti-abortion. I would say that all the Protestant community are against abortion. The Rev. Sydney Garland, on behalf of Ministers of four Protestant denominations, stated emphatically that the Protestant community were in favour of the referendum. I will quote a few sentences from his statement: As a group of Protestants we wish to welcome the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland. We utterly reject abortion as a great assault on the sanctity of life. We rejoice in the continuing protection which the Pro-Life amendment would ensure for the unborn child. We agree that the unborn as well as the born have a right to life. We accept that the life of the mother is also protected in the wording of the amendment. We reject the criticisms of the amendment put forward in some recent Protestant statements. It is said that this amendment will not help in any way the women who go to London for abortions. I agree it will not, but it will certainly prevent an increase in the number of women who go to London for abortions. As the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, stated, we must be sympathetic in many circumstances where a woman or girl makes this awful decision to have an abortion. As a society we must take the blame for much of this. We can understand the situation and have sympathy for the people concerned. For instance, I can imagine the distress of a mother who suddenly discovers that her 14- or 15-year old daughter is pregnant. What a dilemma not only for the girl but also for the mother and father of the girl. The mother sees the life of her daughter ruined. To go through a pregnancy at that age must be very traumatic not only [507] for the girl herself but for the family also. Perhaps in the circumstances the mother might be tempted to go to London with her daughter, but what will that solve? What good will it do? Killing the child will not help the young teenager. Society should give back-up support to that family. They should be given advice and help in every way. The family should not be left in the situation that they see no other way but to take their daughter to London for an abortion. I read a case recently in the newspapers of a women from a rural area who went to London for an abortion. She had five young children, twins who were retarded and a husband who batters her. The woman comes back from London relieved of the unwanted pregnancy, but what does she come back to? She comes back to the five children, to the twins who are retarded, to the husband who beats her up and probably to another pregnancy in a few months time. It is her situation that is wrong. The fact that she goes to London for an abortion is not doing her any good. Probably it is only putting her into a situation of guilt, psychiatric upset or emotional upheaval that will only add to her dilemma. That woman should be given help with the husband who is battering her and also with her children. There are many cases where we can at least understand and sympathise with women. As the Minister of State said, it is not an easy decision for any woman to have to take. I was glad to hear the Minister of State reiterate her full commitment to this amendment. I know that not everything written in newspapers is correct but there is also no smoke without fire. The Minister of State was quoted as having made the following statement in America.;2057503

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Barry Desmond;The Labour Party;Before addressing myself to some of the principal susbtantive issues raised by this Bill I wish to place on record my concern about some elements of the context within which this Bill has been brought before us. It is of course a sign of a vibrant democracy that groups with particular interests and opinions should have ready access to the organs of public opinion and above all to Members of the Legislature. It is also entirely proper that matters of such fundamental importance as those raised by this Bill should receive extensive public discussion. In this case, however, I have to say that in my view the extensive, considered and dispassionate debate in the community as a whole which should precede any initiative to amend our Constitution has not taken place. Instead, we have witnessed an unprecedented campaign to promote this legislation prior — and I stress that word — to the legislative process having a democratic opportunity to assess the grave questions raised in this debate. More importantly, however, I regret the attempts which seem to me to have been made to discredit those who have voiced their reservations or objections to the measure now before us. As one who has made my opposition to abortion well known I find it personally offensive that, by a mixture of direct attack and innuendo, those who for good reasons oppose this Bill should stand accused of favouring abortion. I trust that [472] such tactics will play no part in the full consideration of this measure by this House. I wish now to turn to some of the reasons why I believe the Bill before us and any similar form of amendment should be resisted. I wish to make it perfectly clear that as much as anyone in this Chamber I am utterly opposed to abortion. My reaction to this Bill therefore is shaped by my overriding concern that this problem be alleviated and removed. My reaction is also shaped by my concept of the place of the Constitution in the life of our community. As I understand it, there is universal acknowledgment that the procuring of an abortion is at present illegal under Irish law. Furthermore, it is abundantly clear that any attempt to change the law in this regard would meet, rightly, with the overwhelming opposition of Irish society, not least as reflected in the membership of this House. It has been argued that the reason why we should amend our Constitution in this regard is due to the possibility that at some future date abortion might be imposed upon the community through judicial interpretation of the Constitution as it now stands and possibly in furtherance of our obligations under international law. There is no evidence to suggest that the tradition of judicial interpretation in this country could lead to such a finding. Rather, there is a widespread feeling that such an interpretation would be repugnant to anyone trained and moulded by Irish law and tradition. In short, the amendment as proposed would not in my view add one iota to the legal ban on abortion in this country. Should such an amendment be made, however, it is salutary to consider the probable consequences. Most obviously such an amendment as is offered to us in this Bill would firmly place the whole question of the right to life of the unborn and abortion within the arena of judicial interpretation. In a matter such as this the wording of a constitutional provision must necessarily be somewhat imprecise. Such indeed is the case in the form of words now before us. In explicitly requiring the courts to have regard to a number [473] of different and possibly conflicting legal rights and responsibilities, I would suggest that such an amendment invites litigation. I would go so far as to say that for the future the present ban on abortion may be argued to be put at greater risk through adoption of this form of words or any similar form than by leaving the whole question to the normal process of statutory control. A second area of imprecision which would flow from the form of words proposed relates to the future position of women who may currently receive treatment in the form of the removal of a cancerous uterus or a termination of an ectopic pregnancy. These procedures, in conformity with the teaching of the majority Church, are currently available because they are argued not to represent abortion. They do, however, result in the termination of a pregnancy and, although this is perhaps technically the outcome of a surgical procedure, I am impressed by legal commentators who have suggested that the future of these procedures may be in doubt following enactment of an amendment such as this. Those who support the introduction of this amendment are unlikely to wish that this be a result of their plan. I do not see, however, that they can be sure that this will be the case. I strongly feel that it is of critical importance at this juncture of this debate that I should, as Minister for Health, put on record not merely my own views — and indeed I stress that my views are shared with those of expert opinion within my Department — but also those of the Attorney General, Mr. Peter D. Sutherland S. C. He has now advised the Government that further to the Minister for Justice's request for advice on the legal implications of the proposed amendment his views are as follows and it is important to put them on record now: In summary: the wording is ambiguous and unsatisfactory. It will lead inevitably to confusion and uncertainty, not merely amongst the medical profession, to whom it has of course particular relevance, but also amongst lawyers and more specifically the [474] judges who will have to interpret it. Far from providing the protection and certainty which is sought by many of those who have advocated its adoption it will have a contrary effect. In particular it is not clear as to what life is being protected, as to whether 'the unborn' is protected from the moment of fertilisation or alternatively is left unprotected until an independently viable human being exists at 25 to 28 weeks. Further, having regard to the equal rights of the unborn and the mother, a doctor faced with the dilemma of saving the life of the mother, knowing that to do so will terminate the life of 'the unborn' will be compelled by the wording to conclude that he can do nothing. Whatever his intention he will have to show equal regard for both lives and his predominent intent will not be a factor. In these circumstances I cannot approve of the wording proposed. It is of equal importance that this House should, in the context of a mature and careful deliberation of the implications of this Bill, take cognisance of the statement issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is important to put that statement on record and I put it on record as follows: He said. 'Pursuant to the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, section 2, the Director of Public Prosecutions has expressed his views regarding the effect upon prosecutions of the procurement of miscarriages under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 in the event of the proposed amendment being promulgated by a referendum.' The director indicated that at present he would, subject to the normal proofs, have no difficulty about instituting a prosecution in relation to the deliberate termination of a pregnancy in any case in which there was no immediate threat to the life of the mother. If the proposed text became part of the Constitution he stated that he would experience grave difficulty in maintaining a prosecution in many cases falling within that category. The view of the director was that the proposed wording would introduce profound uncertainty in regard to the enforcement of the [475] law relating to procuring abortions. I suggest that the views of senior staff in the Department of Health, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the considered, mature and very carefully expressed views of the Minister for Justice, on whom fell the role of introducing this Bill, must be given the greatest of consideration in this House in relation to the text of this amendment. I mentioned earlier that my opposition to this Bill is also influenced by my perception of the role of the Constitution. In many respects Bunreacht na hÉireann is an admirable document, not least in regard to its provisions concerning human rights. As elaborated by the courts, our Constitution has served us reasonably well over the past 40 years and more. Changes in the text must be approached with great caution. However, I do believe that there are many respects in which the Constitution merits further examination and perhaps substantial change. Members will be familiar with the principal areas in respect of which change has been canvassed from time to time. For example, I am concerned that the provisions of the Constitution concerning private property may have an unduly restrictive effect on social legislation which would eliminate many of the most glaring abuses arising from land speculation. Such changes should follow detailed consideration and widespread discussion. At the end of this process constitutional change should reflect a groundswell of opinion and the provisions enacted should provide a focus for unity and common purpose. By contrast, the provisions of this Bill have served as the focus of social division of an intensity unprecedented in recent times. This House must be concerned with the divisive influence of the campaign which culminates today in our continued discussion of this Bill. I believe that it is particularly unfortunate that the nature of the division thus fostered is characterised by quite clear denominational differences. In these times of ecumenical dialogue and progress, when the need for reconciliation [476] between the denominationally distinct communities in Northern Ireland has never been greater, it is entirely regrettable that a constitutional amendment of dubious intrinsic value should serve to drive a wedge between adherents of the majority Church and the other principal religious communities. There are, of course, many thousands of members of the majority Church who, while fully respecting and supporting their Church's teachings and tradition in this matter are totally opposed to this amendment. In short, the damage to communal well-being, which will result from the social divisiveness of this measure, far outweighs the notional, and indeed very dubious benefits which it may confer. Many have commented on the deplorable waste of resources which will be involved in conducting a referendum of this issue at this time when the scarcity of resources has forced painful decisions upon the Government with regard to the availability and expansion of valued services. As Minister for Health I am acutely aware of the potential benefits of the alternative uses to which the resources concerned could be put. However, this is not a major objection on my part. Over and above all other considerations, my opposition to this Bill and the proposed amendment stems from the legalistic and impersonal response to the tragedy of abortion which it purports to represent. Of course, it is no answer to the problem of abortion. The sorry trail to abortion clinics in Britain and other countries still remains. It is inconceivable that effective action could be taken to prevent Irish women, who so choose, from seeking abortion in Britain in the tragically large numbers of recent years. Some have suggested that they could be forcibly restrained. Even if such were physically possible, which it is not, the measures required would be intolerable in a civilised society. A solution to the grave problem of abortion is not to be found in constitutional amendments. It is, rather, to be found in a serious analysis of the reasons why so many of our people, who have been raised in an atmosphere of respect for human life, should so decide to seek [477] abortion. I would suggest that the answer may be found, in large measure, in the pressures experienced by many vulnerable women, particularly young unmarried women who find themselves pregnant. This pressure comes from immediate family, relatives, neighbours and friends many of whom would cheerfully vote in favour of the amendment contained in this Bill but apply a different and particularly unfeeling standard when the problem confronts them personally. A community which, to a considerable extent, encourages women to seek solutions to their problems outside Ireland would be entirely hypocritical in enacting the proposed amendment. As Minister for Health and Social Welfare I propose to give special attention to those services which may reduce the pressure on those otherwise led to seek abortions in Britain and elsewhere. I am very much aware of the valiant efforts made by statutory and voluntary organisations to provide such services, often in a hostile climate. I might make the point that I am currently, within the Department of Health, seeking some basic fundamental information regarding this question. As soon as I have the information I will make it available. I refer to information in relation to women who go to the UK, America, Holland, France and other countries seeking abortion. This is far more than 4,000. I also believe that the availability of an effective family planning service would contribute in no small measure to reducing the numbers considering abortion as a real possibility for themselves. In this regard, I have already announced that I am undertaking a comprehensive review of the operation of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979. I shall be bringing proposals for changes in this area to the Government at an early date. I only wish that the same energy, drive, commitment and money which has been devoted to the campaign promoting this amendment could be devoted to tackling the grave problems faced by many families in the care and development of children in our society after birth. My opposition to this Bill stems from deep personal conviction as well as what [478] has been, I hope, a careful and dispassionate weighing of the various issues involved. The Labour Party secured an agreement in the Joint Programme for Government that all of our members would have the democratic right to a free vote on this issue when it came before the House. I think that that is the honourable course and I feel that all Members should be in a position to express themselves freely on this issue. I regret that this may not be the case. I am more hopeful now that this debate has commenced that wiser and more tolerant counsels will prevail. This proposal originated outside the main parties and has been pushed by a vociferous pressure group who, despite their good intentions, may do more harm than good. It will have no substantive impact on the services provided by the State and it is impossible to judge what its legal consequences may be. In these circumstances I see no difficulty in voting on this Bill in accordance with my assessment of its merits since differences between Deputies who are members of the Cabinet on this issue carry absolutely no implications for the execution of the agreed programme for government. Accordingly, I strenuously urge the House to reject this Bill and not to go ahead with this socially divisive measure, the possible side effects of which are unknown and which would have no practical impact on the phenomenon of abortion in our society.;2057509

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;F;Ms. Eileen Lemass;Fianna Fáil;I do not have the name of the newspaper but I think everyone knows what I am talking about. It was most unfortunate for Fine Gael and the Taoiseach that the paper quoted what the Minister of State said in America. I know she denied it but what she was trying to realises there must have been some truth in what was quoted. However, I will take the advice of the Chair and will leave it at that. Fianna Fáil accept 100 per cent the wording of the amendment but according to the Attorney General certain words in the amendment might have the opposite effect. One of them is the word 'unborn'. If the Attorney General is serious about this — I suppose he must be — I would accept 'unborn' as being from fertilisation and if he would like to insert in the amendment 'the unborn is a child from fertilisation' I would accept that. However, when he says that 'unborn' could mean that a foetus between the 25th to the 28th week becomes a person, at what moment does it become a person, a child? Is it at the 25th, 26th or 27th week? A birth could take place at 20 weeks and perhaps the child could survive so you cannot put a definition on any week, day, hour or minute between 25 weeks and 28 weeks. There would be a possibility that an abortion could be allowed up to 28 weeks when the child could be born at 24 weeks and could live. [509] The Attorney General has also referred to the words in the amendment 'with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother'. I do not think that any doctor finding himself with a problem regarding a mother and child will stand by and do nothing. As Deputy O'Hanlon said this morning, he would certainly do everything he possibly could to save both and he would not stand back and allow the situation to arise where he could do nothing for either mother or child. I think the Attorney General is talking a lot of rubbish. The Minister said that he had an open mind about the wording of the amendment. Almost everyone agrees with the principle. The wording is all-important and must be accepted by all sides including representatives of all the Churches in Ireland and the Irish Council of Churches in Belfast. The majority if not all of the Churches of all denominations agree with the present wording and it is only right that the present Government should honour their commitment to continue with the present wording and have this amendment in our Constitution, as they have agreed, by the end of March. Nobody would criticise them overly if it were to go a couple of weeks beyond that. The people, 58 per cent of whom are in favour of this referendum and will vote in favour of the amendment, will not criticise the Government if the referendum should be a few weeks beyond that time. I urge the Government to get the referendum to the people as soon as possible. It has been said that perhaps the European Parliament or the Court of Human Rights in Europe could at some time put us in a situation where legalised abortion might come to Ireland. Many people say it is not possible that that will happen, but I would like to read a page from the Southern Health Board, County Cork, stating what took place in the European Parliament recently.

104;An Bille Um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Michael Barrett;Fianna Fáil;(Dublin North-West): This Bill contains the considered views of the majority of our people who believe that the Constitution should give expression to the right to life of the unborn child. The proposed amendment is intended to give expression to the value that all sections of the community place on human life. The amendment is designed to extend in a positive way the existing constitutional protection of the life of the citizen to the life of the unborn child while at the same time respecting in full the life of the mother. It is argued sometimes that the life of the mother can be saved only by way of abortion but there are no medical circumstances in which [479] the life of a mother can be saved only by killing the unborn child. Women do not die because abortion is not available. A medical practitioner does not give preference to one life as against the life of another. He tries to save both. The Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child was established to rally opposition to abortion in the Republic and, consequently, to affirm the value of human life from the moment of conception by ensuring the absolute right of the unborn child to legal protection from induced abortion. The promoters and supporters of this amendment believe firmly that the amendment as it is worded will ensure that abortion can never be legalised in this country except by way of the democratic will of the people at another referendum. This amendment would ensure that the Supreme Court could never determine that abortion be legalised. This, in itself, would be a great achievement. If the amendment places an obligation on the State to protect the life of the unborn child, the State must then maintain effective legislation to back up the constitutional position. Acceptance of this amendment would not interfere in cases of women going to England to have abortions. There are areas in which a democratic State cannot intrude. In many countries such as Belgium where abortions are performed widely, the State does not prosecute although abortion is prohibited by law. If the present law here had constitutional backing the Director of Public Prosecutions at any future date could not turn a blind eye to cases of abortion in the Republic. Much as we might regret women going to Britain for abortions or to any other jurisdiction in which such injustices are legal, we cannot prevent them from doing so but in so far as possible we can prevent referral agencies from operating. A curtailment in this respect would have the effect of fewer Irish women going to Britain to seek abortions. Those who favour abortion argue that the amendment is sectarian but the right to life transcends all religious beliefs. It is not sectarian nor does it represent the moral view of any [480] one religion. The present legal safeguard in respect of abortion is enshrined in the Offences Against the Person Act. That law was enacted by the British Parliament in 1861 but it could be challenged in court at any time by an abortion lobby in a specially chosen case. In the US abortion was provided for by way of a ruling of the Supreme Court in 1973 but it was done against the will of most Americans. In Britain a Bill known as the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill was passed in 1967 and became known as the Abortion Act. That law removed legal protection from the unborn child up to the 28th week of pregnancy. Since the introduction of that legislation, two million babies have been destroyed. Abortion in Britain has become a very lucrative business with a turnover of between £30 million and £50 million each year. The amount of money involved has led to the development of widespread abortion agencies in Ireland. The lesson to be learned is that the time has come to ensure that the unborn are protected against abortion but we must do so before we have a major problem on our hands. This amendment, if accepted, will give constitutional protection to the unborn child. The right to life is a basic human right. It is a right that must not be ransomed to pluralism or to the concept of the so-called woman's right to choose. We must not be influenced by the condoning of abortion in other countries. The Irish people should be seen to give testimony to the value of human life. Every child, whether he be unborn or whether he be handicapped, has the right to life. These most silent and defenceless babies are part of the human family and need our support in ensuring their right to life. Despite the different views on abortion expressed by the various groups who have been formed to oppose the amendment, they are all in total agreement in their opposition to it and say that it will not solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies. The amendment was never intended to do this. Some of these people argue that their motives for opposing the amendment relate to ensuring the safety [481] of a woman's health especially in cases of rape or incest. A child conceived as a result of either of those two crimes has not committed any crime. He cannot be blamed for the circumstances of his conception. There has been reference from time to time to the EEC or to the European Court of Human Rights imposing abortion on us but no member state can be compelled to adopt abortion laws without there being a change in the Treaty of Rome on which the EEC was founded. In the case of the European Court of Human Rights, decrees of this court cannot override the Irish Constitution. If they conflict with it, an amendment of the Constitution is necessary because our Constitution, as it stands, does not contain any specific protection for human life before birth. The forthcoming constitutional amendment is about the prevention of legal abortion and the direct killing of the unborn life, but as long as the people wish, the existing law will remain. The amendment has no other objective, and its passage will mean no new restrictions of any kind on anyone. It will confer on the most defenceless group in the community the same constitutional protection you and I, as citizens already enjoy. The decision of this Government to change the wording of the amendment is most regrettable. In view of the fact that the present Taoiseach, when in Opposition, announced publicly in November 1982 that his party had sought legal advice on the wording of the amendment and that their legal advisers found it fully acceptable, it would seem that the decision of their Labour partners in Government not to support this amendment, irrespective of the wording, has created a problem for the Taoiseach. The Labour Party's attitude towards this amendment is withholding from the unborn child the same protection which they as citizens enjoy, that is, the right to life. I believe the intervention of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this amendment is most regrettable because it was the general understanding that his role was completely outside politics and that [482] it was his duty to act in that office in an impartial way.;2057522

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;F;Ms. Nuala Fennell;Fine Gael;This debate to provide for an additional subsection to be added to section 3 of the Personal Rights, Article 40, of the Constitution has engendered a considerable, and at times an emotive, if not shrill, public debate. This, I believe, is a reflection of the very deeply held public concern and conviction about abortion, the manner in which it touches our perception of right and wrong, and the way in which we regard life itself. The concept of something in the order of 60 million abortions throughout the world each year is overwhelming in its magnitude, as one which, along with the increasing easy availability of abortion on demand, causes very great concern to many individuals and organisations. It is a concern which can evoke, or can be brought to evoke, a very definite political response. Developing legal and political experience in other jurisdictions strongly supports the desirability of a constitutional guarantee here for the unborn. People who say that this is unnecessary cannot ignore foreign experience. The question for the Oireachtas and the country is the extent to which the right to life should be constitutionally protected. There is an argument that the existing law, the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, is adequate and that there is no possibility whatsoever of the Supreme Court recognising any constitutional right to abortion. We have, however, moved beyond this argument and are in a situation where the issue is now, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, being brought to the people for their best judgment. The wording of the proposed amendment raises serious medical and legal issues for consideration. There is the central question of the actual point in time at which the legal protection afforded by the amendment will extend to the fertilised ovum or to the embryo, and how this protection will relate to existing medical [483] and social practice, such as ectopic pregnancies, uterine cancer and the use of the morning-after pill and inter-uterine contraceptive devices. One of the notable things about the discussion and public debate on the amendment, which has been carried on over the best part of the last two years, has been the apparent contradiction in professional opinion. To many people it appears that we are into the realm of dial-an-opinion politics, with groups in the legal, medical and religious spheres emerging with apparently diametrically opposing theories and evidence to support their particular stand on this issue. Now that the debate has finally come before this House, there are many among us who would wish that it could be an open and honest debate, with Deputies on both sides of the House making contributions based on clear information, full and hopefully impartial briefing and an understanding of any implications involved. Maybe this is too much to expect, in view of the fact that this amendment issue was used in such a cynical way by the Opposition at the start of the last election, but it is none the less something I would aspire to, and believe it is our duty. In my opinion, it is only through honest and open discussion that we can come to a consensus view, which will be the right one for this House and for our society. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the many people who afforded me time and material to contribute to an understanding of the issues involved. Because I am a feminist it has often been presumed that I must be in favour of abortion. There is an automatic assumption that if you work for, or have a commitment to, the campaign for women's rights, you would also be in favour of abortion legislation. I could never support this view because I believe that abortion is fundamentally wrong. I do not expect a citation for this fact, nor would I judge any woman who has had an abortion. I merely mention it because in terms of feminism, I am exceptional when it comes to the international view [484] of abortion legislation and its availability. I also mention it because many Opposition Deputies accused me last year of being pro-abortion, possibly because I have worked for women's rights. Where abortion is resorted to, I regard it as an unfortunate violence against women, apart from the other violence against the foetus. I must further state that while my commitment to feminism does not include an acceptance of abortion as a woman's right, it very emphatically does include a commitment to ensuring that women have free and ready access to comprehensive family planning methods, which I do not regard is now the case, and it also includes a commitment to ensuring the protection and safety of a mother's life in pregnancy and childbirth. I do not intend to get involved in the legal, medical or theological arguments of this Bill. I feel that the Minister for Justice's speech has dealt very effectively with most of those arguments, and I have no doubt that many other speakers will follow this course. I am not a lawyer, theologian or doctor. I am a woman and a mother. I intend to use this debate as a platform to raise the social issues involved in this discussion. The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution is about people and specifically about pregnant women. I do not imagine that the subject of pregnancy in any specific detail is one which can have filled many pages of the Official Report in the past. This could be related to the fact that until recently very few Members of this House could become pregnant and actually give birth. It has not been a problem or a reality for TDs or for many Senators. Because it is very apparent that the pregnant woman has been kept at a distance from the main public debate I would like, with feeling and sensitivity, to bring her into the debate and to dwell now on the condition of pregnancy. Perhaps I should add that it has tended to be regarded as making a case for abortion when on public platforms and in public debate anybody has spoken actually about women and pregnancy and I do not want this interpretation put on my [485] contribution. The overwhelming majority of women between 14 and middle age can become pregnant. For most women it is a happy and welcome occasion. For the majority of women, the missing of a first period is a cause for celebration. Every new pregnancy, every new baby, is a different experience. Pregnancy is an extraordinary manifestation of the working of nature in which women play a major role. For some women, however, the wondrous celebration which I have described does not follow on the warning signs that they could be pregnant. For them it is a time of anxiety, even despair. Until recently, discovering or confirming a pregnancy was usually a long-term exercise, entailing a visit to a doctor, a urine test and very often awaiting the other physical changes or symptoms which confirm a pregnancy. This took a couple of months and involved others — a GP, relations and friends. Nowadays, as with so many other areas of technological advance, we have a do-it-yourself kit which can be bought at any chemist's shop for a reasonable price and which will predict with good accuracy the negative or positive results. There are also various confidential pregnancy testing agencies advertised in newspapers and magazines. With these methods, which need not involve a family doctor or friend or, indeed, anybody else, a woman can very privately and very quickly determine if she is going to have a baby. This confirmation of pregnancy for many women can have a devastating effect. A woman for whom a positive test confirms an awful suspicion can be locked up with her grim secret, isolated, alone and afraid. I would emphasise, for the benefit of men in this House, that to be pregnant is not like any other state of being. It is not like having a cold, being hungry, having 'flu or suffering a hangover, in so far as these are temporary conditions while pregnancy is long-term, with lifetime implications. For many women the news of a pregnancy comes with very mixed feelings. Apart from the women who see it as a cause of celebration and happiness, there are others who feel absolutely shattered [486] at the discovery. I am making this point in some detail because I wish to dispel the idea that women are a homogenous group whose circumstances are all the same and whose feelings are identical. Every woman is an individual. Women live many different lifestyles, subject to different conditioning, under various pressures, but all with a common capacity to become pregnant. There are women all over Ireland, living in every constituency represented by TDs in this House, for whom becoming pregnant is far from a joyful discovery. These women include mothers with larger families than they can cope with, many living in very inadequate housing. They are women with health problems, for whom pregnancy is regarded as a hazard, wives in difficult marriages, women who are not married, girls from 14 upwards who are at school or at work — these are the women for whom an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy can be an unremitting nightmare and who are faced with the agonising decision about abortion. I know that many of these pregnancies are because of lack of access to proper family planning methods or because of inadequate sex education— or due to the immature and irresponsible behaviour of men. Many Irishmen, I am sorry to say, do not accept responsibility for their sexuality, and it galls me to see how quickly many of them will point the finger at a woman who is the victim of an unwanted pregnancy. Can I say that I know that many a fee for an English abortion for an Irishwoman came out of the pigskin wallet of a respectable and upstanding member of Irish society, as a pay-off for his sexual indiscretion. For a society and a country committed to the total exclusion of abortion legislation now and in the future, we have a pitiful record when it comes to the treatment, the needs and the role of the unmarried mother in our society. It was surprising to hear Deputy Dr. Woods, in the first contribution from the Opposition, claim concern about the agencies helping women here to cope with this problem. It had a hollow ring. In his time over the years as Minister for Health assistance to such organisations took second [487] place to expenditure on deals like the Talbot plan, or Knock Airport. The total funding in 1982 for organisations like Cura, Cherish, Ally and the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents, not to mention other health organisations like the Samaritans, came to £34,810. By any standards, this is far from adequate. I would like to commend these organisations for their work and commitment, and assure them of my express support, within the confined financial limits today. I cannot see this constitutional issue in isolation from the lives of the people with whom it is concerned, women and children. We have to take into account the lives of many Irish women in Ireland today. We have an obligation here to tackle the problems confronting women. One of the most appropriate areas for legislative change is the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy, under which it will be possible for an expectant mother to make a declaration of paternity and I am examining the proposals of the recent Law Reform Commission on Illegitimacy with a view to the earliest possible legislation. But we have other obligations — they entail making provision for childcare facilities, legislation to give access to comprehensive family planning, examining the availability of voluntary male and female sterilisation, and above all, to plan a programme of adequate housing for larger families, for those who need them and for single parents so that no woman will be forced by circumstances to have to opt for abortion. It is scandalous that we have families living in grossly overcrowded conditions, as I well know, with 15 and 16 living in a three-bedroomed house and young unmarried mothers with their babies living in damp, rat-infested basements. We should not legalise abortion. I have given a commitment in any election I have ever stood for that I would never contribute to, or support, the decriminalisation of abortion. I support, with my party, the holding of this referendum, but would ask the House to spare a thought for thousands of our countrywomen —[488] and they are our countrywomen — who go to England for abortion. What is this experience like? I think we should dwell a little on it. I would ask the Chair if I may quote a section from a book by Simone De Beauvoir who writes about the plight of women, these Irish women who go abroad. This quotation is from her book called The Second Sex, Chapter 2, The Mother: They undergo the humiliation of begging and cringeing: they beg for an address, they beg a doctor and a midwife to take care of them they risk being haughtily turned down, or they expose themselves to a degrading complicity. The deliberate invitation of another to commit an illegal act is an experience unknown to most men, and one that a women undergoes in a confusion of fear and shame. In her heart she often repudiates the interruption of pregnancy which she is seeking to obtain. She is divided against herself. Her natural tendency can well be to have the baby whose birth she is undertaking to prevent even if she has no positive desire for maternity, she still feels uneasy about the dubious act she is engaged in. For if it is not true that abortion is murder, it still cannot be considered in the same light as a mere contraceptive technique an event has taken place that is a definite beginning, the progress of which is to be stopped. Some women will be haunted by the memory of this child which has not come into being. Helene Deutsch—— That is in the 'Psychology of Women': cites the case of a married woman, otherwise psychologically normal, who was twice compelled, because of her physical condition, to lose a foetus of three months and who felt obliged to erect a small tombstone for each of them. She piously tended these memorials, though she later produced several children. Incidentally in Japan, where abortion is very common, it is a known fact that women who have abortions also erect small memorials. [489] To continue the quotation: If the miscarriage has been voluntarily induced, the woman will have more reason to entertain the feeling that she has committed a sin. The remorse that in childhood may have followed the jealous wish for the death of a newborn brother is revived, and the woman feels herself guilty of having really killed a baby. Pathological states of melancholy may express this feeling of culpability. Other women may gain from abortion the sense of having destroyed a part of themselves and feel resentment against the man who has agreed to or requested this mutilation. In another case cited by Mrs. Deutsch, the girl was deeply in love and insisted on having an abortion for the sake of her lover's career but afterwards she refused to see him, feeling that she had sacrificed too much. Men tend to take abortion lightly they regard it as one of the numerous hazards imposed on women by malignant nature, but fail to realise fully the values involved. The woman who has recourse to abortion is disowning feminine values, her values, and at the same time is in most radical fashion running counter to the ethics established by men. Her whole moral universe is being disrupted. From infancy woman is repeatedly told that she is made for childbearing, and the splendours of maternity are for ever being sung to her. The drawbacks of her situation — menstruation, illnesses ... are all justified by this marvellous privilege she has of bringing children into the world. I merely quote this extract to indicate that it is not a joyful occasion for any woman who has to have an abortion. It is generally accepted that the text of the amendment is not perfect. I believe it is entirely reasonable for the Minister for Justice both to acknowledge this, and to say that he will fully consider any views on a better text advanced by representatives of the Churches or of other groups. That is the essence of democracy. Parliament is the place to consider the detail of [490] the wording, and there should be no objection to accepting that it might be improved upon. The Minister has adopted a very responsible approach which reflects opposition to abortion but does not adopt a 'closed' mind on what is best. The amendment is concerned with protecting and balancing the right of the unborn child and of the mother. It is difficult to define in the circumstances where, precisely, the line should be drawn. The Minister has said that he is more than willing to listen with an open mind to anything said inside the Dáil or outside it which will help to clarify the text and prevent any future difficulties. My contribution here should not be interpreted as advocating or making a case for, abortion here. I do not want abortion in Ireland. I appeal for an understanding and recognition of the risks which could be involved in this constitutional amendment. Finally, as members know, as part of our programme for government and my particular responsibility we have given a commitment to the setting-up of an all-Party Committee on Women's Affairs. It is my hope that this committee which I hope will be set up very soon will be the focus of interest shown in this debate, which is about a women's issue and which will be carried on into the work of that committee when established.;2057533
116;An Bille Um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;F;Ms. Eileen Lemass;Fianna Fáil;As recently as February 1981 the European Parliament held a lengthy debate on the position of women in Europe and the Chair was taken by the President, Madam Veil, who herself brought in legislation for abortion in France. So many people were at that meeting, so many women wishing to hear what was being said, that extra chairs had to be brought to the Chamber for this discussion. They listened to a report of an ad hoc committee which recommended that women should have freedom of choice for abortion and stressed that the progress achieved in Europe in this regard is a contribution to the emancipation of women throughout the world. It was recommended that any pressure which can be brought to bear through Community instruments in those matters on those member states where abortion legislation is still unsatisfactory would be justified. It proposed the harmonisation of legislation on abortion in all member states of the EEC on the basis of three principles: women living in the Community should make their own decisions, prosecution for abortion should cease [512] and the voluntary termination of pregnancy should be free. That that type of situation obtains so close to us as in the EEC of which we are a member is very alarming. Pressure could be brought on this country to legalise abortion and the only safe, secure and positive way to ensure that it would never happen is to enshrine the provision in our Constitution. The people have a right to enshrine that in the Constitution and there should be no ambiguity whatever about the fact that they have that right. The opportunity to exercise it should be given to them as quickly as possible without all this argument, back-tracking and uncertainty taking place at the moment. The Taoiseach agreed with Fianna Fáil's wording of the amendment. He gave his full commitment to it. We have given our full commitment to supporting it and it is very sad that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice should change their minds on this issue. I accept their statement that they are fully committed to the referendum. I cannot see why they cannot still be committed to the wording.;2057534
117;An Bille Um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Liam T. (Junior) Cosgrave;Fine Gael;If the Bill before the House is approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas it will give the people an opportunity to vote on it in a referendum to enshrine in the Constitution protection for the unborn child, which is not specifically referred to in the Constitution at the moment. There has been much talk about the specific wording produced by the previous Government prior to the general election and the change of Government. It has been suggested that there may be some doubts in relation to the wording. If there are it is important that we establish this at an early stage, that we change the wording if necessary or we proceed as heretofore. The Minister for Justice indicated some reservations about it, both in the House and outside it. He is obviously concerned that any wording placed before the people is watertight. I know the previous Minister for Health and the Opposition party are also concerned that any wording which goes before the people is watertight. That is why the Minister for Justice has invited comments [513] from all the various interested people, the main Opposition party and the various other groupings who are concerned that a referendum should be held, to discuss this matter. It is important, if there are any doubts, that we establish these at an early stage. Every person has his or her own opinion in this regard and while the present wording might be regarded as sufficiently adequate by 99 out of 100 courts there might be one court where it might not be adequate. We have obviously to think far ahead because if this change is enacted by the people it will remain part of the Constitution until it is changed by the people. We are, as indicated by the commitment given by the Fine Gael Party prior to the election going ahead, and having introduced the Bill in the House, it is intended to hold the referendum at the earliest possible date. As most people know, legislation has to be discussed and passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas. A certain time has to elapse before a referendum is held in the case of a constitutional Bill like this. I assure Opposition Members and people outside the House of our party's commitment in this regard. If it goes past 31 March as long as we adhere to the referendum, as long as we keep to the principle of the referendum and as long as there are sufficient safeguards in whatever wording is decided on, that will count at the end of the day. I am very glad that our Leader recognised that the unborn were not given enough protection in the Constitution. This was also recognised by the Leader of the Opposition. Both have a commitment in this regard to see that enough protection is given in the Constitution to the unborn. The Constitution gives protection to the life of children and adults but it does not give any specific protection to the life of the unborn child. That is the reason why both of them were committed to enshrining in the Constitution a specific protection for the unborn child. It is only by having such an amendment that a case will not arise some time in the future when some legislation might be overturned by a court. It is most unlikely that the present Supreme Court would [514] overturn some legislation but at some time in the future it is certainly a possibility. What seemed unthinkable 15 or 20 years ago has now unfortunately become a fact in other countries and abortion on demand and killing the unborn child literally at will have become part of the make-up of various countries. I hope this is not something which will happen here. Abortion could become legalised here in two ways. It could become legalised by the Supreme Court rendering present legislation unconstitutional, allowing certain loopholes and eventually allowing abortion in certain cases initially and finally on demand, as has happened in other countries. The other way abortion could become legalised is if both Houses of the Oireachtas were to legalise it. This might seem unlikely and I suppose today it might seem impossible to many people but if the unlikely, particularly in politics, is possible it could happen. I hope, if there has to be a change in the wording and when the Legislature are looking at any possible substitution, that both those avenues for the introduction of abortion will be closed. I hope if the referendum is passed by the people it will ensure that if abortion is ever to become available here that we will have to go back to the people and get their consent to have abortion legalised. While it is most unlikely that the Legislature would legalise abortion it is possible. Both avenues I have referred to have to be taken into account in framing any wording which will prevent abortion. This debate has been going on for a long time. I hope from now on there will be a consensus of opinion among the various interested parties and across the political parties because this is a matter which transcends all the political parties. There may be some people in the various political parties who feel that this referendum is not necessary. I hope the two main political parties — I know there are members of the Labour Party who are also committed — are committed to holding this referendum. If any difficulties arise we can all get down and discuss them. It is important that we unite in the face of certain people outside who are doing everything in their power to prevent [515] this referendum taking place. We might divide into two categories the anti-amendment people. First, there are those who, while opposed to abortion, do not consider the amendment necessary. They have put forward various reasons for this, but I would not agree necessarily with everything they say. There are others who, while claiming to be anti-abortion, are pro-abortion. These people should be exposed for what they are. They know that they will not get anywhere by going on a pro-abortion platform so their attitude is to introduce various elements into the issue to confuse it. They are introducing an element of subtle qualification in an attempt to prevent the referendum from taking place and they are engaging in all sorts of delaying tactics to this end. I should like to mention the coverage that has been given in the media to that sort of campaign especially in one national newspaper who have adopted a total anti-amendment campaign. This paper has carried most unbalanced journalism in regard to this whole issue. We might well ask whether the people concerned with that paper have at heart the legitimate interest of the Irish people. They are trying to dictate both to the Government and to the Opposition and to convince us that in some way a referendum of the kind proposed is in some way undemocratic. If we are not to be guided by the ballot box, how are we to proceed? It is interesting to note how abortion has come about in various countries. In some of these places the concept of abortion would probably have been unthinkable 20 years ago but in various ways, whether by legislation or by court rulings, abortion is now legal in many places. There are people who will say that this could never happen here, but unfortunately the position is that it could happen and possibly will happen if we do not push ahead with this legislation. The anti-amendment campaign people have used tremendous resources and influences at various levels in their efforts to have the referendum postponed. One of the reasons they have put forward in support of their case is the cost of the [516] referendum. I should hate to think that we are beginning to equate the preservation of human rights with monetary considerations. While recognising that much new thinking is required in the whole area of sex education, we must also spend money in helping people who become pregnant but who do not wish to have a child. When we have put this legislation through we must concentrate on providing services for women who find themselves in such difficult situations. We cannot close our eyes to the problem. It has been said that this legislation would not prevent girls from going to England to seek abortions. While that may be true, we must ensure that we will not have abortion here. Another charge that has been made in regard to the amendment is that it is sectarian. The saving of human life and prevention of the killing of the unborn are not the prerogative of any one religious group. They are a human race issue. The killing of unborn babies is to be deplored. The Bill is designed to give effect to a commitment given by this party. Again, I assure Members of the Opposition that our party are committed to holding the referendum at the earliest date possible. It is important that we listen first to any doubts that may be expressed about the wording of the Bill. Then, if there is a problem, we must deal with it but the referendum must go ahead so as to ensure the right to life of the unborn child. The likelihood of legislation being introduced here to provide for abortion may seem remote but we only have to think back on the situation of the past 18 months when hung Dáils were the order of the day and when various pressure groups tried to influence the Government of the day, and perhaps did so, in relation to other matters. However, I should like to think that, in regard to the issue before us, any pressure that might be applied by any group holding the balance of power would be resisted. Regardless of what wording may emerge at the end of the day, it must be watertight in regard to the purpose of the legislation — the prevention of abortion whether by way of a Supreme Court judgment or by way of legislation enacted here. [517] I look forward to the Bill being approved by the House and to the holding of the referendum at the earliest date possible. Some of those who are opposed to the amendment are the very people who seem to be continuously advocating peace and the avoidance of war in the interest of the preservation of human life. What could be more basic than a measure to preserve human life from the beginning?;2057535
118;An Bille Um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Donal Ormonde;Fianna Fáil;In recent years there has been a welcome and a growing tendency in our courts to place special emphasis on individual rights and personal freedom. However welcome this trend, society and the State have an obligation to intervene in areas of potential conflict — for example, in cases where individuals in the exercise of their rights might be endangering the rights of their fellows. It is such an area of potential conflict that is envisaged and provided for in the Bill before us. In this measure we are inviting the electorate to accord to the unborn child a status which many presume is enjoyed already by the unborn. The wording of the amendment reflects as accurately as possible the clear wish of the overwhelming majority of our people and has been framed after wide consultation with leading and legal experts. A number of doctors have levelled criticism at the amendment and have referred to it as an unwelcome intrusion into medical ethics. On the contrary, this legislation will act as an effective guarantor of the centuries-old ethical tradition which acknowledges the inviolability of human life from the moment of conception, a standard abandoned so conveniently elsewhere but which at least this country must preserve. It will not be enough for us simply to put on record by way of constitutional amendment the inviolability of the unborn child. As a matter of urgency we must accept the challenge which follows from our decision, that of offering an acceptable option to the many thousands of women who each year travel to the United Kingdom seeking abortions. At present at least one in every two women faced with [518] the prospect of single parenthood, opts instead for termination in the United Kingdom. A clear commitment is needed to mobilise all the available sources and services to alleviating in so far as possible the complex social and other pressures which force an increasing number of our women to seek such a drastic remedy. I have a major fear that this Government now intend to go back on their commitment to proceed with the referendum on the pro-life amendment. It now appears as if this war of words and the involvement of both the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions is a deliberate smokescreen used by the Government to confuse and upset the people in the hope that this amendment will simply go away. I want to refer to the intervention of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this issue. This is a grave matter and particularly distressing because I believe he does not have a function in this matter and that it is outside his area of responsibility. Under section 2 (4) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, the Director of Public Prosecutions is defined as a civil servant in the civil service of the State. Under section 3 of the Act which deals with the functions of the director, it is stated in subsection (3) that nothing in this section shall affect the functions of the Attorney General in relation to any question as to the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. It is quite clear, therefore, that the director as a civil servant has no business interfering publicly in a matter of political controversy which is furthermore a constitutional matter in which the Attorney General has the sole right to advise the Government as the law officer appointed for this purpose under the Constitution. If the Taoiseach was a party to this being done by the director, then it shows a fundamental misconception of the Constitution on his part. Leas-Cheann Comhairle, let me assure you and the Government that Fianna Fáil do not intend to let this amendment die like the many thousands of unborn children who are dying every day. In November 1982, shortly before Fianna Fáil left [519] office, we tabled the following amendment: The State acknowledges the right of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right of the mother, guarantees in its law to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. This formula was widely accepted by all concerned as the most satisfactory solution to a complex problem. To the best of my knowledge the legal brains on all sides found the wording most acceptable. The Taoiseach on a number of occasions endorsed the wording and was committed to putting the amendment with this wording to the country by 31 March, saying that before he had endorsed the wording he had taken legal advice on it. Do we now presume that that legal advice which he availed of at that time, was not that of the present Attorney General? Must we presume, therefore, that the Taoiseach has a number of legal advisers who are giving him conflicting views? How can the Taoiseach have done such an about-turn on this issue? Can it be that the pressure are so great from within his own party and from his Coalition partners that he is no longer master of his own destiny? What is this amendment all about? The 1861 Offences Against the Person Act deals inter alia with abortion (a) where a drug, for example, is self-administered and (b) where a drug or appliance is used by another person. In both instances the intent to procure an abortion is essential while, in addition, in the first case, where a drug or appliance is self-administered, it is necessary also that the person be pregnant at the material time. The 1861 Act could be set aside in three ways: first, by Act of the Oireachtas second, by its being determined to be repugnant to the Constitution by the Supreme Court and third, by decision of the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. An amendment to the Constitution conferring rights on and protection of the unborn would protect the 1861 Act. Nothing more is intended. Fears have been expressed that it would be used to [520] prevent the prescription and use of certain forms of contraceptives and that in some way repressive action would be taken against certain clinics. Again I say this is not the intention and, indeed, I doubt if such action would be possible. In connection with the interuterine contraceptive device — IUCD — for example, while there is a large volume of medical opinion in favour of the view that it acts as an abortifacient, there is considerable doubt as to the precise mode of action. It would appear to me that in any criminal proceedings the onus would be on the State to prove criminal intent, something which clearly is not possible. In the case of the so-called 'morning after pill', it would have to be established that at the time of taking the pill the woman was pregnant, believed herself to be so, and used the pill for the purpose of abortion, none of which in my view could be established in a court of law. Concerning the wording, as far as I can gather the objections by the Attorney General have been raised against the words 'unborn' and 'equal rights'. 'Unborn' can only mean human life from conception or fertilisation to birth, at whatever stage, and I believe the confusion raised by the Attorney General is continued in this. One could add the words 'from conception' or 'from fertilisation' but that would raise a furore from the users of the morning-after pill and the IUCD. It could then be said that the amendment was sectarian and so on. The second problem in relation to the wording appears to be 'equal rights'. This has always been the case under national law. In 1931 Pope Pius XI emphasised that both lives are equally sacred and this principle has always been applied from the medical ethics aspect. I believe the Attorney General's views are erroneous. My understanding is that Deputy Kelly finds the wording of the Bill satisfactory and he surely is the constitutional expert in the Government party. I do not see many Members in the House to refute that. I believe the introduction of the remarks questioning the words 'equal rights' is divisive and just a red herring across the trail to confuse [521] the issue. What is wanted here is a constitutional amendment to protect the 1861 Act — nothing more — nothing less. Fianna Fáil are totally committed to this amendment. We too, have taken legal advice and the situation is that the wording as contained now in the Bill is the most acceptable under the circumstances. There is no doubt that the amendment is needed because as the law stands now there is no specific protection for the unborn child. The amendment will not, as has been suggested by the Government, change the present legal position in regard to abortion. It will give essential reinforcement to existing law and will ensure that any future decision to legalise abortion in Ireland can be made only by the democratic vote of the majority at another referendum. May I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Government to let the wording stand, to let the referendum go ahead and allow the people to decide for themselves on this major issue? Please do not now try to cloud the issue and confuse the people. We need this amendment our people are entitled to this protection. The Government will not be forgiven by the electorate if they once again do an about-turn on one of their pre-election commitments. The Government and the Minister for Justice have our assurance of full support for the amendment using the present wording.;2057536

120;An Bille Um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Mervyn Taylor;The Labour Party;The previous speaker and proponents of this amendment to the Constitution have said that very many abortions are taking place at present in the UK. We all know that that is so, but if it is so, it is certainly not because our law permits abortion in any way it does not. It prohibits it quite clearly and unequivocally. I understand that the cost of holding a referendum is about £1 million and the object of that exercise is alleged to be that it is necessary to introduce certainty into the law prohibiting abortion. However, irrespective of the formula of words chosen, whether as now before us or in a different form, the reverse effect, in fact, will be achieved. Our law is already quite certain, is fixed and has stood the test of time since 1861, [522] a period of over 120 years. No one to my knowledge has ever seen fit to challenge that law and, as far as I know, no individual person in the entire State has indicated his or her intention of even attempting to challenge the law. If a writ or a plenary summons to challenge the existing law were to issue tomorrow morning, it would take over a year to achieve a High Court hearing and even longer again a Supreme Court hearing. The very earliest such a challenge could take place, if issued at all, to be determined by the Supreme Court, would be about the end of 1985. Yet, such were the pressures brought to bear by a small group and such was the response of the leaders of this country that a commitment was given to have legislation completed and a referendum introduced to bring this issue into our Constitution by 31 March 1983. That was a remarkable achievement by a small pressure group and, I am sorry to have to say, a poor comment on the leaderships that responded and deferred to it in the way that they did. Deputy Kelly touched on this aspect when he suggested that in the run up to a general election the political parties should not receive representations. I do not agree. It would be better if the parties received the representations, but showed enough backbone to resist, or defer, pressures in appropriate cases like this one, rather than bend supine in the fear — whether real or, more likely, imagined — of loss of a few votes. Let us assume for a moment that some person did proceed to issue a writ and challenge the law, what would our Supreme Court likely decide? Would they decide, or might they, that the de Valera Constitution of 1937 permitted legalised abortion? Is it seriously contended that that is what our Supreme Court and High Court judges would determine? Deputy Kelly is a renowned constitutional lawyer and he put it this way, that there was not the slightest chance of it happening. As a practising lawyer for over 25 years, knowing the members of the Supreme Court as I do and having read many of their judgements, I would put it even more strongly. The [523] very idea that our Supreme Court judges would interpret that the Constitution of 1937 permitted legalised abortion is utterly preposterous. To carry the hypothesis to its ultimate, let us assume for a moment that, by dint of some wild aberration, our Supreme Court judges did find for abortion, would not then be the appropriate time for Dáil Éireann to bring in remedial legislation? I find it quite remarkable, at a time of unprecedented economic stress, unemployment at an all-time high, industries and factories closing down daily, that so much valuable time in this House and so much effort and thought in the country are being deflected from the immediate, urgent, vital, pressing issues of now. This is a time, as never before, where the collective brains and political ability of this House should be directed to, and working overtime on, preserving what remains of our industrial base and providing useful employment, building houses for people who have no homes and providing support, financial and otherwise, for the thousands of children of deprived homes. There is much talk here on this Bill of the rights of the unborn. Should we not also spare a thought for the rights of the born? If we did, perhaps many — or, at least, some — of those Irish women who travel to the UK for abortions might not do so if they could be assured here of supportive action, financial and otherwise. We have the remarkable situation that this whole debate is taking place under pressure, with a deadline date, not because there is any pressing, urgent need for a reform of the law on this issue — for abortion already is illegal — not because it would make any difference at all to, or in any way affect, the women who travel to the UK for abortions, for it will change little at all in that regard, not because it will do anything at all to provide supportive services for any of those women who travel to the UK but who might not do so if support were provided for them. This whole measure is being discussed and debated, not on the basis of any existing facts or existing present situation, [524] legal or otherwise, that now faces the organs of Government here. It is based on a whole series of hypotheses, of things that might happen in the future. The first hypothesis is that some person at some time in the future might be minded to issue a writ to declare the Offences against the Person Act of 1861 unconstitutional. Sixty years have gone past in the State and nobody has done it yet, nobody has indicated that they intend doing it. That is the first hypothesis. The second hypothesis is that at some future date the Supreme Court of the day, perhaps in 20 or 30 years' time, might find that the 1937 Constitution of de Valera permitted abortion. The third hypothesis is that, if both those hypotheses came to pass, each of them more unlikely than the last, at that future hypothetical date, Dáil Éireann, the elected representatives of the Irish people, would fail to bring in the legislation that would thereupon become necessary to organise, put in order and regulate that branch of the law. We have real enough problems on hands at present without applying our minds to hypothetical ones which are highly unlikely ever to arise and, if they did, when they arose would be the appropriate time to deal with them. Of course, the problems of 20 or 30 years hence would be for Supreme Court judges of another generation. I do not say that Dáil Éireann might not have to think ahead and apply its collective wisdom to what might happen then but, for the problems of 20 years hence, next year would be time enough to tackle, consider and deal with those. And if that situation arose, highly unlikely and improbable as it is, in my view the proper manner in which to deal with this subject would be to enact laws which would be debated and passed here in Dáil Éireann and not by means of constitutional amendment. This constitutional amendment, if adopted in any form, whether with the existing or any altered words, will initiate a saga that will go on for a long time. In my view it will bring the matter into the ambit of the courts. There will be court cases aplenty on the subject then, something [525] which has been avoided for the last 60 years since this State was founded. The very objective of the exercise is supposed to be to avoid the matter coming for consideration before the courts, something we have successfully achieved for the past 60 years. In my view the reverse effect is quite likely. The final point I want to make on this subject — but I regard it as no less vital and important than my previous one — is the question of the sectarian nature of introducing an amendment on this subject into our Constitution. The record of successive Governments from both sides of the House, in dealing with the minority religions, has been exemplary. Successive Governments have bent over backwards, beyond the call of duty, to meet the religious requirements, educational and otherwise, of the minority religions. As a member of a minority religion myself, we sometimes have a way of putting it like this — that we do indeed suffer from discrimination but reverse descrimination. By that we mean that facilities are accorded us out of all proportion to the numbers of the minority religions. For that reason, and having regard to the excellent record successive Governments of this State have had in the past in dealing with the minority religions, it would be a great pity if the great fund of goodwill that has been built up over decades would be dissipated by pushing through any constitutional amendment on this issue in the teeth of unease and indeed opposition on the part of the minority religions. They have made their position quite clear, that they do regard the proposal to introduce this subject into the Constitution as sectarian. There is no good saying that they should not, that it is unreasonable, that it is not a good idea. The fact is they do regard it as sectarian and have made their position clear on that. That is sufficient. I do not need to spell out what will be the reaction to this issue in the North of Ireland. Irish unity is something to which we all aspire. I have no doubt that that cause will have suffered a setback, and for what? For what — because not one but a number of hypotheses are being considered and taken as likely to come [526] about while, in my view, none of these hypotheses has any likelihood whatsoever of ever coming to pass.;2057538

In a letter published in The Irish Times of 1 July 1982 by a doctor who has spent a professional lifetime in the practice of obstetrics and gynaecology in what is the largest maternity unit in either Ireland or Great Britain it was stated that there was no medical condition known to him where termination of pregnancy was necessary to save the woman's life. In support of that contention of his one has only to refer to the annual reports of the Maternal Mortality Committee in which every death in the Republic of Ireland has been recorded over a period of 17 years, and they have been so recorded on an annual basis. Subsequently a further report appeared which indicated that the number of births in the Republic of Ireland for the year 1981 was 72,335. It is also recorded that eight mothers died in that time. The cause of death was not related to the fact that the woman was pregnant in at least five of the instances and no one of the other three could have been saved by the termination of pregnancy. A scientific article entitled 'Therapeutic Abortion, The medical Argument' which was mentioned earlier this morning by Deputy O'Hanlon appeared in the Journal of the Irish Medical Association in August 1982. It was based on detailed analyses of maternal deaths in the National Maternity Hospital over a period of ten years. The conclusion was that therapeutic abortion would have had no beneficial effect and that women do not die in childbirth because therapeutic [492] abortion is not practised in the Ireland of today. To my knowledge that contention was never challenged. It is unfortunate, indeed sad, that the medical argument has been used as a wedge to prise open the door anywhere abortion has been legalised and is now freely available. It is also very sad that it has been used with tremendous effect to divide the Churches. Surely every form of medical treatment that a patient receives involves some risk to that patient? That applies to men and women and to children, whether born or unborn. An expectant mother who takes a normal aspirin for a headache inevitably involves her unborn child and whenever a general practitioner treats a pregnant woman he must be acutely conscious of this. Those of us in this House who have had the privilege of having children of our own know how potentially harmful drugs are used with greater discrimination during pregnancy. However, in the final analysis every woman must receive whatever treatment her condition requires, medical or surgical, and no form of treatment is precluded whether she is pregnant or not. There has never been conflict here because an essential feature of guilt is the intention to commit a crime. In the case of abortion wrongful intent is an essential element of the criminal action. This is specifically mentioned in the statute which governs the present legal position in respect of abortion here. Professor Kieran O'Driscoll of the National Maternity Hospital and also of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at UCD has stated that during his 35 years at the National Maternity Hospital no woman was every deprived of treatment appropriate to her condition because she was pregnant. The men and women in the street are well aware of this fact and they do not easily confuse legitimate medical treatment with deliberate action undertaken for the specific purpose of killing an unwanted child. If a person does a good act and something foreseeably bad happens, that person is not liable. If there is a dangerous fire and someone must be saved from an [493] upstairs room, a fireman may go up a ladder knowing that it could collapse and kill or injure a person below. He is not liable if an accident occurs. If a girder fell and two men were trapped the foreman might find that if it were shifted one way it would kill the first man, while if it were shifted the other way it would kill the second. Does he stand by and say that since both cannot be saved both must be allowed to die? Of course not, although this is what the Attorney General seems to think a doctor would say. If both cannot be saved, then every effort must be made to save one. There are people who, though they are against legalised abortion, are also against the referendum. I have to assume that those people have reasons for this attitude which satisfy them but it must also be said that there are those who favour legalised abortion in Irish hospitals and are prepared to conduct a vociferous campaign to introduce it here. These people are also solidly against the holding of a referendum and against the democratic process which involves the vote of the common citizen. The people who would wish the law to be changed so that women could have abortions in any maternity hospital are afraid of the steel door that may come down as a result of the referendum. Their wish is not so much to influence the vote of the people as to prevent the people from exercising the right to vote. We have been told many times that the amendment could be divisive on religious grounds. Do the people who hold this view regard the statutory measures which illegalise abortion as being divisive on religious grounds? I take it they do not. The Minister for Health seems to be one who holds that view. I wonder by what intellectual path some people travel which brings them to the conclusion that a measure that would guarantee the continuation of an already existing statute, which they themselves do not identify as being religiously divisive, should itself be regarded as religiously divisive. Are there Members in this House or the other House who feel that precious public time and resources would be [494] expended to no useful purpose on this amendment? In the course of his speech the Minister for Health stated: Many have commented on the deplorable waste of resources which will be involved in conducting a referendum on this issue at this time when the scarcity of resources has forced painful decisions upon the Government with regard to the availabilty and expansion of valued services. As Minister for Health I am acutely aware of the potential benefits of the alternative uses to which the resources concerned could be put. In my opinion public time and public resources could not find any more worthy area of endeavour than the safety of the voiceless. Surely that should not be a matter of argument it is a matter of values. People ask why there is a necessity for an amendment to the Constitution. As it now stands the Constitution does not contain any specific protection for human life before birth and only by such an amendment can we be certain that the existing ban on abortion will not be removed as a result of action in the courts. The referendum will give the people rather than the courts ultimate control over policy in this area. Abortion is prohibited by the 1861 Act. Like any other law in this country, this could be changed by the Oireachtas, although I think it is unlikely. However, a change in the law could come about through the courts without the people or their elected representatives being consulted in any way. Abortion could become legal as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court. As we know, sometimes to our cost, there need not be an unanimous decision of the court. Three out of five judges would be sufficient. I listened carefully to what Deputy Kelly had to say last week about our legal system. I am not a legal expert, a Cheann Comhairle, but I know you are.;2057539
122;An Bille Um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;At this stage in the debate it is useful to look at the origins of this constitutional amendment Bill before the House and to consider it in that context. The origins of the constitutional amendment arose around April of 1981 when the pro-life organisation had meetings both with Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the then Leader of the Opposition and with Deputy Haughey, the then Taoiseach. It is fair and accurate to say that at that time the Leaders of both the major political parties in this House accepted in good faith that there was a need for a constitutional amendment. I believe they both correctly perceived that the overwhelming majority of people in this country are opposed to abortion and that, within this House at that stage, there was unanimity on the part of members on all sides of the House that they disagreed with abortion. I believe that unanimity on the part of Members of this House persists to this day. I believe all Members of the Fianna Fáil Party, Fine Gael Party, Labour Party, The Workers' Party and our Independent Deputy, would share the view that they disapprove of abortion, they do not like abortion. Certainly I have not heard any Member of this House of any party at any stage suggest that abortion should be legalised or that the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act should be amended. Therefore, in April-May 1981 there was a consensus view about abortion that still persists with us. I believe that Deputy Haughey and the present Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, took the view at that time that, with that consensus view, with the existing legislation, it would be a relatively simple matter to frame an amendment of our Constitution which would, in a sense, copperfasten the legal position. I believe it was never anticipated by either of them that there would be any difficulty in finding an appropriate form of wording. It would seem it was an issue on which there was political consensus throughout the country. But the matter became somewhat [527] more complicated after that. We went into the June 1981 General Election. When that election was over the Attorney General, Mr. Sutherland, discovered there were difficulties in framing the appropriate wording for an amendment of the Constitution. We then had an election in February 1982 and the Fianna Fáil Party returned to power. Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach again and requested two different Attorneys General to prepare a form of wording to be inserted in the Constitution by way of an amendment. It is my belief that both of those Attorneys General, although their periods in office were brief, found it extremely difficult to frame an appropriate form of wording and it is my understanding that four, if not five, possible forms of wording were proposed at various times by both of those gentlemen in order to meet the commitment which had been given to provide for a referendum on this issue. It certainly became apparent before the February 1982 election that this was not a simple issue, that it was not a simple matter to put a form of wording into the Constitution which would reflect the existing law. It was perceived by different law officers appointed by different Governments that there were considerable difficulties which were never foreseen either by the present Leader of the Opposition or the present Taoiseach. I intend to address myself to some of those difficulties and to the wording of the proposed amendment. Before doing so I wish to look at the legal position and the reasons given for the need to amend the Constitution. The present law in this area is to be found in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. These provisions have rendered abortion illegal since 1861 and provide for criminal penalties to be attached to those who carry out abortion. The word 'abortion' is not used in that legislation but there is far more technical and detailed wording which requires a form of intent to cause a miscarriage and it is a wording quite different from that contained in the proposed amendment. [528] It has been argued by the proponents of the need for a constitutional amendment that the need arises due to the possibility that one day our Supreme Court might find that one of the sections of the 1861 Act is unconstitutional and might find that there is some form of constitutional right to abortion. That, in essence, is the whole argument for this amendment. It is based on the proposition that at some stage the Supreme Court might find a portion of the 1861 Act to be unconstitutional. It is an Act that has been with us for over 45 years of the lifetime of the present Constitution. It has been with us since 1937 and no person has ever sought a declaration of unconstitutionality in regard to this Act. Whilst I accept that many of those who express the fear that the Supreme Court might act in this way sincerely believe this to be the case, I believe they are doing so without any clear understanding of our legal system or our constitutional law or the type of processes which apply in seeking to have an Act declared unconstitutional. They are expressing their fear without reference to the declared comments of the members of the Supreme Court in this area. It would be understandable if the worries expressed about the immediate need for the constitutional amendment were as a result of members of the Supreme Court, or even of the High Court, having indicated, hinted or suggested that one day they would find that there was some form of constitutional right to abortion. The only judicial comments in this area indicate the exact opposite. They were made originally in a form of litigation to which some people point as justifying the urgency of this amendment. Only one member of the Supreme Court has ever commented in detail on this issue. These comments were referred to by my constituency colleague, Deputy John Kelly, but it is worth referring to them again. In the McGee case the right to marital privacy was declared which entitled married couples to have access to contraceptives and to plan their families. In that first case in which the Supreme Court declared that this right existed and spelled out what the right to [529] privacy was, Mr. Justice Walsh made it quite clear that the right did not extend to the right to abortion. He spelled it out quite explicitly to ensure that there would be no misunderstanding of the right to marital privacy, yet it is that right to marital privacy which is pointed to by some of those people who propose that this amendment is an immediate and urgent matter. Even more recently in the case entitled G. versus An Bord Uchtála 1980, Mr. Justice Walsh returned to this theme and stated what he regarded as being the rights of the child, as did other members of the Judiciary. Mr. Justice Walsh stated: Not only has the child born out of lawful wedlock the natural right to have its welfare and health guarded no less well than that of a child born in lawful wedlock, but a fortiori it has the right to life itself and the right to be guarded against all threats directed to its existence whether before or after birth. The child's natural rights spring primarily from the natural right of every individual to life, to be reared and educated, to liberty, to work, to rest and recreation, to the practice of religion, and to follow his or her conscience. The right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend (and to have preserved and defended) that life, and the right to maintain that life at a proper human standard in matters of food, clothing and habitation. It lies not in the power of the parent who has the primary natural rights and duties in respect of the child to exercise them in such a way as intentionally or by neglect to endanger the health or life of the child or to terminate its existence. The child's natural right to life and all that flows from that right are independent of any right of the parent as such. I wish here to repeat what I said in McGee's Case at p. 312 of the report:—'... any action on the part of either the husband and wife or of the State to limit family sizes by endangering or destroying human life must necessarily not only be an offence [530] against the common good but also against the guaranteed personal rights of the human life in question'. There can be no doubt as to the judicial view of the right to life. There can be no doubt that the only judicial statements made in this area have quite clearly indicated that under our present Constitution the right to life is sacred. While accepting the sincerity of many of those who see the need immediately to insert this amendment in the Constitution, I believe that this opinion is not based on a clear understanding of what our courts have said to date on this issue. Having referred to the McGee case, in which the right to marital privacy was pronounced by our courts and where the court were equally clear about the right to life, it is argued also that when the Supreme Court in the United States declared there was a right to marital privacy the Supreme Court in later years went on to expand on that right. In doing so the Supreme Court sought to provide, effectively, for a constitutional right to abortion. The fallacy of that rationale is that there is no similarity in the area of children's rights and family rights between our Constitution and the American Constitution. The American Constitution does not have any articles in any way similar or comparable to the family rights contained in Articles 41 and 42 of our Constitution, which rights were used by our courts to discover, interpret and declare the right to marital privacy. I do not believe there is any possibility that our courts would interpret our Constitutin in a manner that would result in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, being declared unconstitutional. Deputy Taylor, and my colleague, Deputy Kelly, referred to the fact that as of now no constitutional proceedings of any nature have been instituted to challenge the constitutional validity of the 1861 Act. That is a point worth making in the context of what I will say later as to how I believe the House should deal with this issue. There are no constitutional proceedings in being. Deputy Taylor referred to the fact that if any such constitutional proceedings were commenced [531] it would take about one year to get them to hearing. Indeed, if any such constitutional proceeding were commenced by anybody it would take a good deal longer than a year for them to come to some sort of finality. If one issues a constitutional case tomorrow morning to challenge the constitutional validity of any legislation it would take a minimum of one year to find its way into the High Court. When it is finally heard in the High Court it will often take the judge who determines the case three or four months to write his judgment. Normally, it takes any constitutional matter at least another year to be determined by the Supreme Court, because if a statute is declared unconstitutional the practice here is that the Attorney General normally appeals against that declaration. I have no doubt that no matter what Government are in power the Attorney General of the day would appeal any High Court decision finding the 1861 Act unconstitutional. There is no question of any overnight rush to the courts, of judges sitting secretly under candlelight deciding, without letting everybody know in advance or without any prior warning to the Government, that the 1861 Act was about to be declared unconstitutional. The feeling of urgency that exists about the issue, the feeling of the need for us to rush to the polls, is something that should be given careful consideration by all Members. Other than the proponents of the amendment who have made a strong case and lobbied politicians of all parties, as they are entitled to do, I have not heard any legal opinions to convince me of the urgency of rushing to the polls. Indeed, I have not heard a single high law officer of the State, in the persona of the Attorney General, appointed by any Government, Fianna Fáil or Coalition, suggesting that there is an immediate need for a referendum of this nature. I would be interested to learn if Members of the Opposition, who seem to think that there is an immediate need for us to rush to the polls despite the warnings that have been sounded about the difficulties that may be created by the wording of [532] the amendment, know of any high law officer in the State who has suggested at any stage that there is this immediate need or urgency. Another argument that has been made about the need for urgency on this issue relates to a suggested possibility that the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg might at some stage make a decision under the European Convention on Human Rights declaring that there is some type of European human right to abortion. That is as much speculation as is the view of what our Supreme Court might do. At no stage has the European Court ever suggested that they would deliver such a judgment. There is no case before the European Court in which they might do so and, indeed, were a decision of the European Court in that area to cause some annoyance or aggravation to us all, it would not have any binding effect of any nature on our legal system. If the European Court declared any country to be in breach of fundamental human rights, while that would be a judicial proceeding, in real terms it would also be a form of political act. The workings of the European Court and the decisions made by it do not domestically bind any state in its own internal laws. It is up to a state to determine whether they wish to comply with those decisions. There is very little, if any, possibility of the European Court making such a decision, but if the court did, no matter whether it was part of our ordinary law that abortion was illegal or whether it was part of our Constitution, that decision would not have any influence on us. Under our Constitution there is no possibility that our judiciary would declare the 1861 Act unconstitutional. However, I believe that if the amendment in its present form becomes part of our law — I have no doubt about this — rather than copper-fastening the continuation of the 1861 Act, rather than ensuring that abortion remains a criminal offence it will give rise to a serious and real possibility that the 1861 Act would be found unconstitutional by virtue of the provisions in the amendment before us for inclusion in the Constitution. I am making that statement, not in an [533] effort to make some political point or to try to support the remarks of the Attorney General, but as a lawyer who has some expertise in this area and as a Member who has had some experience in constitutional actions. The simple view that was taken of this form of wording, before the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions made their comments, without a detailed examination of the wording being carried was that if one supported this amendment in a referendum one was anti-abortion but if one voted against it one was pro-abortion. That is one of the great ironies of the debate that has taken place so far, although in the last seven days a good deal more realism has been injected into the debate than we have had before. The irony is that I have no doubt, not merely from the interpretation the Attorney General has given but from the other interpretations that can be validly taken from the amendment, that if it in its present form becomes part of our Constitution it will essentially secure a constitutional judgment in the not too distant future requiring the House to enact legislation to permit women to have abortions.

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;Before Question Time I said the simple way of looking at this legislation in the context of the present wording proposed to be included in the Constitution was to regard those who support this wording as being against abortion and those who disagreed as being in favour. This is one of the great ironies of this debate, because people have made these presumptions in the belief that this Bill merely copperfastens the existing law by ensuring that in no circumstances can the Dáil or the court require the Oireachtas to provide legislation to permit abortion. This problem arises because of the nature of the wording that this Bill proposes to be included in the Constitution. First, I should like to refer to the words which are The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. In recent days we have had different interpretations offered as to what this wording means. The Attorney General pointed to the fact that the word 'unborn' is used in a most unusual context and does not state exactly to what it is referring. He indicated it would be open to the Supreme Court to interpret the word 'unborn' as being the foetus when it attains the state where it is possible of being born, after 28 weeks within the womb, which is the medical prognosis that there is some possibility that the foetus could retain life. In those circumstances, that was a valid interpretation that this amendment would permit an abortion up to the 28th week of pregnancy. Another possible interpretation is that 'unborn' would be taken by the Supreme Court to mean the time of conception, and that as and from immediately upon conception taking place, the unborn would be protected. If that was correct, and looking at the definition of the word 'unborn' in the context of this amendment, there would not be a problem, but we are dealing with a constitutional provision. Its proponents have [579] sought to have it included in the Constitution to bring certainty to our law. Even at the start of this proposed new provision one can see uncertainty. I have mentioned two possible valid interpretations of this wording. It has also been suggested by the Attorney General that by virtue of the right of the unborn being regarded as having equal force and effect as the right to life of the mother, if a mother had an ectopic pregnancy, or is suffering from cancer of the womb, or requires other medical treatment that could result in a foetus being aborted, even though the intention was to save the life of the mother, doctors would be unable to act because another possible interpretation of this provision is that the unborn and the mother would have an equal right and medical personnel would have to stand back, watch what happens and hope both lives would save themselves. If there was a possibility that that was not the case, medically they could not intervene until they were satisfied that the foetus or the mother would cease to live, at which stage presumably an attempt to save the foetus might or might not be viable. The result of another interpretation of the word 'unborn' is that constitutionally the Supreme Court at some stage in the future could say it is constitutionally acceptable for abortions to be conducted until the 26th or 28th week of pregnancy. Because of the equality of right between the unborn and the mother, even in those instances where presently there can be medical intervention to save the life of the mother, that would become constitutionally impossible. There is another possible interpretation which has not yet been publicly discussed, but which I believe is just as valid as those which have been suggested — and in my view, it is just as worrying. Let us take the view that this amendment does what I think was intended by its drafters, that is, it protects the right to life of the unborn after conception — that phraseology is not used — and ensures that where the life of the mother is at risk there can be medical intervention. A simplistic view could suggest that the wording [580] preserves the existing legal position. I believe, however, that if this wording is included in the Constitution in its present form, it will go a great deal further than the existing law, and eventually will do the opposite to what its propoments campaigned for — it could open the flood gates to abortion, and it could be done quite simply. If the intention of the article is to protect the equal right to life of the mother, one must ask what that means. Does it mean that if a mother's life is seriously endangered by a pregnancy, we would allow the pregnancy to go through a full term and possibly keep the mother alive on a life support machine or does it mean something more than just preserving a physical existence? Has the quality of life some relevance to this argument? If it does, if included in the Constitution, would this Article permit abortions to take place where not only a woman's physical health but her mental health was endangered? Could it not equally be argued that the right of the mother to life requires a right to a proper and viable life in mental good health? Is that not a valid argument? If that were the final judicial interpretation of this amendment, then this amendment would permit abortions to be carried out where a mother's mental health was said by psychiatrists to be endangered as a result of her becoming pregnant. I do not believe that that is an intent on the part of the drafters of this Article. The interpretations to which the Attorney General has referred, the worries which the Minister has expressed and the additional possible interpretations of this Article in the area of abortion which I have given all have validity. There is not a Member of this House who can categorically state that if this matter were dealt with before our courts this year, next year, or in 20 years time, one of these interpretations to permit, and indeed constitutionally require, abortion would not be accepted. It is not something that could be constitutionally required under the existing Constitution, without this Article. That there is a variety of valid, different interpretations of this Article means that it is not appropriate to be included [581] in the Constitution to carry out the intent of those who believe that such an Article is required. Too often we address our remarks to each other across the floor of this House and engage in some form of party-political battle tactical forays take place across the dividing carpet we make points which we hope will score a few political knockouts on the way and in the context of the ordinary rough and tumble of political life in this House in debates on ordinary legislation that is an acceptable exercise. However, it is not an acceptable exercise when considering amending the fundamental law which governs our civil and religious liberties. It is not acceptable for Members on either side of this House to insist on inserting into our Constitution a new Article which contains a form of words which it can quite cogently, accurately and honestly be argued might achieve exactly the opposite purpose to that proposed. To all the Members of this House, in Government and in Opposition, who oppose abortion, it should be a major concern, as it is with me, that if this Article were included in the Constitution, not only could the courts constitutionally require this House to enact legislation at some future date to permit abortion but it is quite likely that as a result of this Article sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against The Person Act which presently prohibit abortion would be found unconstitutional. This Article would be the legal ground for such a finding on the basis of one of the interpretations which have been given. The 1861 Act does not provide for abortions to take place in the exceptions to which I have referred. For example, the present law does not permit an abortion to take place if a woman's mental health might be endangered if she became pregnant. Because of the possibility of this Article being interpreted in one of the suggested ways, if included in the Constitution, rather than copper-fastening the 1861 Act it would form the vehicle upon which that Act would be challenged. In saying that, it behoves Members to ask where this original form of wording came from. This has not yet been made clear to us. It is known that successive Attorneys [582] General found it difficult to draft an appropriate form of wording. The form was accepted in good faith by the Fine Gael Party when this form of wording was published immediately prior to the last election — a form of wording recommended by the previous Attorney General, discussed within the relevant Government Departments, fully and properly analysed with all the legal machinery available to Government and found acceptable and workable. Yet, what has been found since? I understand that this form of wording is not anywhere to be found in the Attorney General's Office, but in the files of that office there are to be found four possible different alternative forms of wording for a constitutional Article, none of which includes the form of wording contained in this Bill. It has been discovered in the Department of Justice that there is no evidence to indicate, or information to state, who gave birth to this form of wording. There is no file on this form of wording in the Department of Justice. As a Member of this House, I want to know was this form of wording drafted by the outgoing Attorney General of the previous Government, or by his predecessor and does it have the approval of either? If it does not, who drafted it, where did it come from? Did it come out of a ministerial back pocket in case an election was called? What was the reason for the production of a form of wording of this nature, of which no detailed examination would appear to have been conducted either in the Attorney General's Office or in the Department of Justice, prior to publication. If that detailed research has been conducted, where have the files gone? Has the outgoing Attorney General got them or has some other Member of the party in Opposition a tale to tell as to who invented this form of wording? That is a very valid question. There have been criticisms in this House of the Director of Public Prosecutions issuing a statement and criticisms inside and outside the House of the present Attorney General's intervention, which intervention has been little more than an explanation of the legal problems [583] which he, as the highest legal officer in the State, sees with this wording. Had either of the two preceding Attorneys General similar reservations and worries about this Article and will they publicly state whether either is responsible for the drafting of this form of wording? Ironically, some of those, with whom I have no sympathy, who believe that abortion should be made available on demand here — something with which nobody in this House has sympathy and very few outside it, either — are now opposing the Article and those who do not want legalised abortion are supporting it. In reality, it should be the other way around. That is one of the great irrationalities of the present debate. The wording of this Article could have other unforeseen consequences in the area of family planning. The worries in this area arise directly out of the phraseology contained in the Article. It is accepted by the vast majority — indeed, it is declared as a constitutional right in the McGee case — that married couples have the right to plan their families, to determine how many children they wish to have, the right of access to information about family planning services and to contraceptives. Those advocating this amendment have said that they do not wish to affect this area of our law, or affect the rights of the family and married couples to determine the number of children and to have access to contraceptives. However, this amendment could seriously invade the area of marital privacy which was constitutionally declared in the McGee case. In so doing, it could form the constitutional basis for striking down family planning legislation enacted in 1979 as unconstitutional. The intention, as described in the Article, is to protect the life of the unborn. As I said earlier, the intent of the draftsmen was to protect the life of the unborn after conception. But the amendment does not use those words. It merely uses the word 'unborn'. If one consults a dictionary to find out what the word 'unborn' means one finds it is a very difficult word to define. In fact most dictionaries, just as they do not define [584] the word 'undead' do not define the word 'unborn'. Presumably something unborn does not have to be conceived, something unborn may not be conceived at all. A child that might be born to a family in 20 months' time, at this moment in time, could quite correctly said to be unborn. Therefore, if we take that as a possible interpretation, which it is, if we even give this article a liberal meaning, a meaning that would permit intervention when a mother's life is at risk, could the effect of this article be to find that constitutionally, on its coming into force, contraceptives would be confined and made available only to married women whose lives would be placed in jeopardy if they became pregnant? There is a valid argument to be made in this area. I believe also that some of the more extreme groups who have advocated the need for this type of amendment of the Constitution, might see this as an opportunity — though they will not say it now, but might at a later stage after we have had our referendum — to use this article, as defined in this Bill, as a means for launching constitutional action to abruptly invade the right to marital privacy previously declared by our courts and to curtail the right of married couples and adults in this country to have access to contraceptives. That is an unforeseen consequence of this Bill. I believe that that possible interpretation and eventuality is as valid as many of the others we have at present. All of this clearly indicates how inappropriate it is that this form of wording be included in our Constitution. Of course there are other possibilities, there are other problems that could arise with the form of wording some people may see it as a problem, others may not. One of the great things about the 1937 Constitution is that whereas it has its faults and there are aspects of it many of us would like to see reformed, it is, in its own way, a vibrant, living, legal document that has been used by the courts to declare many constitutional rights that the courts have regarded as implicit in the Constitution that were probably never envisaged by the drafters of the [585] Constitution, many of which probably would come as a surprise to the Members of this House who had the privilege of being here when that Constitution was debated. There have been all sorts of rights found to have been implicit in the Constitution — the right to travel, the right to bodily integrity, the right, to which I referred earlier, to marital privacy. The courts have gone out of their way to declare the rights of children. The courts use the article to find a very basic area in our taxation law, that we could not tax married couples living together at a greater rate than two single people living together. All of these are rights that the courts have interpreted as implicit in our Constitution. I wonder what other rights could be taken out of the wording of this article and be found, at a future date, as implicit in our Constitution? If we look at this article simply, bearing in mind all I have said about the effects it could have on our abortion and family planning laws — effects I believe which are highly undesirable — we find that there are one or two desirable implicit rights that could be found if we enacted this article that I am not sure members opposite are aware of. I believe there are many people on this side of the House who are opposed to the death penalty. I include myself in that number. I believe also there are a number of Members on the opposite side of the House who take a similar view. But it was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, during the period in office of the last Coalition Government, to make it quite clear that they were in favour of retaining the death penalty. If we enact in our Constitution an article that provides for a right to life of the unborn it is not a great leap of intellectual mountain-climbing for our courts to interpret that article as implicitly also giving a right to life for the born. Arising out of the right to life of the born, without the difficulties of balancing rights, in the context of the right to life of the mother, we would have a fairly absolute right to life for all of those living in the State. I would welcome that development that is not something I would quibble with. That [586] type of right, however, would result in what remains of the death penalty in our criminal law being found to be unconstitutional as well. In fact, finding that as an implicit right resulting from this constitutional amendment, is a far more likely right — indeed is one of the few desirable possibilities arising from this amendment, as presently worded — and could end capital punishment in this country. I wonder if Members opposite have thought of that? If they support that, I am delighted to know about it but I wonder do they understand that is a possibility. Very often in this House we conduct what can best be described as a dialogue of the deaf. We engage in debate. We hope, with a bit of luck, we might get reported the following day. Perhaps if one says something either outrageous or vaguely intelligent one may find one gets one's picture in the paper. By and large what goes on in this House by way of debate is irrelevant because the courses of action are pre-determined by the Government of the day. This is an issue on which I believe all Members of this House are united in one purpose, that is their opposition to abortion being legalised in Ireland. I believe there is also a majority of Members of this House who would wish to see our existing family planning laws not curtailed, probably a majority would wish to see them liberalised, made more acceptable and sensible. To all of those, and in particular to Opposition Deputies, I would ask them seriously, as legislators, to apply their minds to what is contained in the present wording that it is proposed be included in the Constitution, and to see that those people who are sounding a warning about this particular wording are genuine in what they are doing, that they are not trying to score political points, or get out of undertakings that have been given but to ensure that a major mistake will not be made by Members of this House simply because one or other side is involved in some type of tactical political battle. I would appeal specifically to Members on the opposite side of the House who are distinguished by their knowledge of [587] law, who are aware of the way the Constitution and our courts work in practice, to state their views on this amendment. There is a well-known academic lawyer in the Fianna Fáil Party, there are senior counsel and respected solicitors — Deputy David Andrews, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, two respected senior counsel who I believe would share many of the worries I have expressed. There is then Deputy William O'Dea, a well-known law lecturer who has gone to press on many occasions seeking to reform antiquated areas of our law and who well understands the workings of our Constitution. There are also Deputies Colley and O'Malley, qualified solicitors, who before they came into this House worked as lawyers, men who in this House have contributed to the development of legislation over the years. If any of those people sat down and examined the wording of this amendment I feel sure they would share many of the worries I have expressed about it. All of us as legislators have a duty to do that. So far I have addressed my remarks to the wording of the present amendment. It has been stated by the Government that work is being carried on to prepare an alternative form of words and it would not be appropriate for me to address myself to that issue since I await the alternative form to be proposed. I wish to say something about the nature of this referendum, the nature of the campaign which preceded this debate and is at present taking place. It has been said by many people of goodwill that there is a sectarian element involved and that the Article before the House could be regarded as sectarian. I do not believe it was the intention of the people who sought a constitutional amendment to be divisive or sectarian or that they mean to approach it from a sectarian basis. Neither do I believe this was the intention of the person who drafted this Article or of Deputy Haughey, Deputy Woods, the Fianna Fáil Party or the present Taoiseach to be divisive or sectarian. As a lawyer who has been involved in many of the recent constitutional cases before our [588] courts, I believe the problems I have outlined bear no relevance to sectarianism of any nature whatsoever. They are real problems related to real social issues which we must fully and properly consider in this House and on which there will be different views right across the religious divide. There is a real problem with the nature of the campaign that has been conducted by some people. It is a continuing problem which I believe will be exacerbated if and when this legislation goes through and a referendum campaign gets under way before polling day. Let nobody be in any doubt that religious borders and barriers are being drawn up. We have already seen different Members quoting what representatives of different churches have said. We have had Papal Encyclicals and quotations from different members of the Protestant faith, Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian, by Members of this House trying to confirm that this is not a sectarian issue because there is someone in each of the different religions who supports the wording of the present amendment. I do not believe that this amendment has a religious or sectarian bias. Indeed, it could be interpreted in a way that would permit abortion in circumstances that would be anathema to every religion in this country but if and when a referendum is held, be it on this or any other wording, there will be a difficulty. I believe we will see public statements of a nature that have never been made since the foundation of the State. I believe the type of campaign some people will run will result in divisive and inflammatory public comment being given an aura of credibility and reportage which would never heretofore have been given. The type of campaign which could follow in the course of such a referendum could do serious damage to the body politic of this country, and I believe it could result in this whole issue descending into the realm of political mythology as other issues have in the past. We have plenty of such issues in our political mythology which fuel allegations of sectarianism or of domination of one or the other parts of this island by the major religions. Most [589] people no longer even remember what the mother and child scheme was about but it is part of our mythology. The Tilson case is part of the political mythology of all members of minority faiths. It was a law case in which a judge upheld a pre-nuptial agreement between a mother and father or a husband and wife whereby they agreed that children be brought up in the Catholic faith. The court allowed those children to be brought up in the Catholic faith and the parties to the marriage were a couple of mixed religion. That case descended into our political mythology because a High Court judge made intemperate remarks about what was then the special position of the Catholic Church. What still is not noticed is that the case eventually found its way to the Supreme Court and the judges there totally disagreed with what had happened in the High Court. The Tilson case, rather than being part of the political and religious mythology of our country, should be part of the history of women's lib because it did not seek to support a religious divide but gave an equality of rights to mother and father or husband and wife of a nature which did not then exist in the United Kingdom or in many other countries. I believe that in this campaign people at the extreme end of those who propose this amendment will make remarks of a nature which up to now would not have been treated seriously and would not have been reported. They will generate an atmosphere which will do great damage to the country both nationally and internationally and to all of us in this island who have for so long talked about reconciliation with the North and the closing of the divide that exists. I say this not because of the issue. I believe that the vast majority in the North, whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, are as much opposed to abortion as are people in the Republic. There is a danger of our being treated to some form of hysterical campaign in favour of this referendum which will result in swords being drawn and a reopening of the religious divide which does not really exist any more in the Republic. I think I should say something about [590] one of the organisations who have sponsored this amendment, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. I believe that organisation have conducted a campaign of vilification against people inside and outside this House which the vast majority of people find disgusting.;2057757

127;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;It should go on the record of this House that the campaign is disgusting and should not be taken seriously. I believe they have deliberately mounted campaigns against individuals who are no more in favour of abortion than they are. They have mounted these campaigns because they are unwilling to listen to other people, unwilling to rationalise or listen to advice they are given and unwilling to accept the bona fides of people who are genuinely against abortion but genuinely concerned both about the wording of this Article and the consequences of a referendum campaign. It is that organisation I most fear doing the type of damage I have talked about, opening up the religious divide in the Republic of Ireland in a manner we have never previously seen. Members of that organisation have been in the habit of using language of a nature one can only describe as deplorable and unnecessary in making the case they sought to make. It is right that Members should express their views about the type of campaign that organisation has conducted. In the context of that organisation, and some of the other proponents who have talked about the great emergency that requires the amendment being inserted immediately in the Constitution, I have a healthy degree of cynicism as to their true commitment. While they have expressed this great concern about the unborn they have not expressed similar concern about the born. We have not heard anything from them about our antiquated and outdated children's legislation or of the need to reform the laws on illegitimacy. There is an obvious need there if we are genuinely concerned about abortion and wish to remove pressures from women who become pregnant to ensure that they do not go to England, [591] or elsewhere, to obtain an abortion. Surely it should be in the forefront of their campaign to abolish the law on illegitimacy. If they are concerned about children, born and unborn, why have they not said something publicly about our adoption laws? We have laws which have destined more than 1,000 legitimate children born to married couples who do not want to have anything to do with them or are incapable of looking after them being required for the rest of their childhood to stay in institutions. The lucky ones have the possibility of fosterage. We have not heard concern about those children or calls for reform in our law on adoption. We have not heard anything from them in the course of the campaign in the last two years about another area that is of particular concern to the right to life. Less than 12 months ago we all heard of two horrific instances of young children being battered to death by their parents, of the parents being prosecuted and sentenced to relatively short terms of imprisonment. The Minister for Health at that time, Deputy Woods, said that part of the problem was that our legislation dealing with children was inadequate. A report was produced subsequently indicating that a major part of the problem was that our health board and social work procedures were inadequate. Have we heard the organisation that is interested in protecting life speaking out about the right of children who have been born to protection, about the right to adequate legislation dealing with children to ensure that intervention takes place and results in children's lives being saved? Have we heard them talking about the need for better social work training and a greater consciousness on the part of health boards and medical personnel in regard to this problem? We have not heard anything in relation to those areas. We have heard a purely negative concern about abortion, a negative campaign to ensure that the law remains as it is which it would do even without the campaign, without seeking to remove the pressures on women who seek abortions never mind about the area of children who are [592] alive and in need of better legislation. We are all agreed that if this amendment is included in the Constitution it will not in any way affect the abortion trail to England. Why do those organisations not use the same energy to raise similar enormous sums of money that have been raised so far in order to mount major advertisements on the front pages of newspapers calling for reform in our laws on illegitimacy or our affiliation laws to ensure that the unmarried mother can get proper sums of money for the support of her child from the father rather than the paltry sum she gets or being prevented by inadequate and archaic laws from fully processing her legal rights? What about reforming the allowances for unmarried mothers and the social welfare benefits applicable in this area so that a woman who becomes pregnant does not have this financial pressure on her that makes her believe that not only will she be rejected by society as an unmarried mother but that she will be put under a financial burden which no Member would regard as acceptable? Why have those areas not been highlighted? If we are genuinely concerned about preventing abortion why has nothing been done about those areas by any of the groups I mentioned? I do not know the answer but I would like to hear an answer because there is no reason why when a campaign was mounted for a referendum that is not urgent some of the more urgent areas I mentioned are not tackled. It is accepted by many Members that there is a need for a general review of our Constitution. I am disappointed that on the first occasion since I became a Member that I have had an opportunity of debating the Constitution that this is the sole area that can be discussed. Many recognise the need for a general constitutional review and I accept that by and large our Constitution is sound but there are only a few Articles in it that need to be looked at again to ensure that the Constitution reflects the values, aspirations and desires of all our people as we enter the last quarter of this century. A review of our Constitution should not be conducted by a committee of lawyers but [593] by an all-party committee of this House and the Seanad. I hope such an all-party committee is formed shortly. I hope that committee will get an opportunity to debate the Constitution Articles that are crying out for reform, some of which no longer bear any relation to the realities of our aspirations or our national life. Indeed, some of them exacerbate the real social problems we have. Like all Members I hope that the new wording to be proposed for inclusion in the Constitution will be discussed here. I hope all Members will accept that the wording proposed now is not appropriate and that when the new wording is published we will have a calm and rational examination of it and its likely consequences. There should be consultations with all groups who have an interest in this area, including those involved in the pro-life campaign, the major and minority Churches. During the course of such a debate members of the public should be given time to discuss the matter through the media. The wording in the amendment has been with us for four months but it is only in recent days that it has been realised that it is not suitable. There is a danger that if a new form of wording is proposed we might rush into accepting it for the purpose of, as politicians, getting a difficult issue out of the way and getting on with other work that has to be done. There is, indeed, a need to get on with other work and I hope that before the summer recess we will get through the House much of the social legislation that is long overdue and for which there is no longer an excuse for failing to introduce it. We should allow time for reflection and discussion of any new wording that may be proposed to ensure that we do not put a form of wording to the people in a referendum that will only result in major problems for us all and for future generations. Like other Members of this House I await with interest the new wording the Attorney General's office and the Government are preparing. I want to sound a note of caution. No matter what wording is produced, it must be given time and it must be considered. I hope [594] this whole issue will now be considered and that any new wording will be considered in the spirit meant. This issue should not—and it would be a disgrace if it did—become a political football with the Government or the Fianna Fáil Party seeking to score points against each other on the back of an issue which is sensitive. about which Members of this House have great concern, and which must be dealt with in a rational, considered and sensitive manner.;2057759

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. George Birmingham;Fine Gael;I stand corrected. In the past they have had a somewhat ambivalent position in this House and it is hard to get used to their current role. I should have said no member of the Fianna Fáil Party is present. It is worth beginning by asking ourselves what we expect of our written Constitution. It seems to me that we adopted a written Constitution, like many newly-independent states, to assert what we saw as different and to assert in a very public way from where the State derived its authority to legislate and what was the source of the authority in the State. That was one function. The other function we saw served by our written Constitution was that contained therein would be a number of legal precepts which we felt were entitled to a higher status than ordinary law and which were, to that extent, more difficult to change or to ignore. Therefore, our Constitution [595] lists a number of rights: the right to life, the right to personal property, the right to freedom of speech, the right not to be arrested and so forth. It has never been suggested that it is inappropriate that such a written Constitution should consider those issues. It would seem to me to be a logical consequence of that, that if it is appropriate that those rights should be enumerated in the Constitution, it is equally right that the Constitution should address itself to what categories of beings are entitled to derive rights under the Constitution. At the moment the Constitution refers throughout to the rights of the citizens. To take one example Article 40. 4, 1º provides: No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with the law. It seems to me to be appropriate that a written Constitution should spell out exactly what categories of beings — and I use as neutral a word as I can—are entitled to benefit under the Constitution. Should rights be confined to citizens? What is the position of aliens? Are rights to be confined to those who have been actually born, or what is the position of the unborn? What is the position of a limited liability company? These are all areas appropriate to the Constitution. At the moment the Constitution is drafted in the most restricted form possible in that it purports to confine rights to citizens. In doing so, it does not accord with the European Convention on Human Rights which is drafted in wider terms to speak of all persons. That is not an academic point. In at least two instances the Supreme Court considered the question of whether or not the wording of the Constitution excludes from constitutional protection non-citizens — in one instance at the suit of an alien in a case arising under the Adoption Acts, and in another instance they considered what constitutional protection it afforded to limited companies when the controversial Marts Bill was contested. I believe our Constitution ought to be wider than simply affording rights to citizens. [596] In those circumstances it is appropriate that at the correct time the Constitution should be broadened to afford protection to all who live in this country, citizens and aliens, and to all who are at risk, born and unborn. I say that because the argument has been made that the suggestion of affording constitutional protection to the unborn is inappropriate. Two arguments are advanced for this, basically. One is the suggestion that it is inherently sectarian. With respect to the proponents of that argument, it seems to me to lack logic. If it is regarded as appropriate that legislation should cover these areas, and it is—nobody has suggested that the 1861 Act should be repealed, and even in those countries with very liberal abortion laws, in all cases abortion is subject to some form of statutory control—I do not see how the case can be made that it is inherently improper for such an issue to be dealt with in the Constitution. The other suggestion is that somehow or other this is an area of particular controversy on which there might be differences of opinion and, for that reason, it is inappropriate to find a place for it in the Constitution. Again, with respect, I fail to see the point. If the Constitution is to confine itself to simply setting out the subjects on which we are all agreed, and on which unanimity exists, and on which there is a total consensus, we might as well save ourselves some money by telling the Stationery Office to cease printing it. If that degree of unanimity and consensus exists, there is no point in having a written Constitution. As the Minister for Justice pointed out in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, in a number of areas in which there is something substantially less than unanimity — such as the case of private property or trade union law — the Constitution does not opt out, does not remain silent, but expresses a clear opinion. It is my belief that if an entirely new Constitution were being drafted tomorrow morning, the draftsman inevitably would have to consider to what categories were rights to be afforded. He would be obliged to do so by the decisions in relation [597] to aliens and limited companies. He would be obliged by the public debate on this issue to consider, as the drafter of the 1937 Constitution was not obliged to do, the position of the unborn. I have to say it is my view that it is in such a context that our Constitution should be extended. From the outset I have stated that I do not regard the Constitution as presently drafted as appropriate. I do not think there is any justification for seeking to confine rights to citizens, and I would wish to see the protection afforded by the Constitution extended. That would be most appropriately done in the context of an overall review of the Constitution. That, as Members of the House are aware, was what was regarded as the optimum position by my party. We also recognised that, if a wording was to emerge, we could not 'dog in the manger' it, to use Deputy Ahern's expression and refuse to look at the wording simply because it had come at a time other than that we regarded as ideal. We indicated what we expected from that wording and we expressed the hope that it would be a positive, pro-life declaration. I have stated publicly that I would have wished, if there was to be a pro-life amendment, that the opportunity would have been taken to abolish the death penalty at the same time and with the same wording, and we accepted too that the constitutional amendment to be proposed would be sensitive to the areas of medical difficulties and to the concerns of the minority Churches. When the wording was published, it did appear that the Fianna Fáil Government had responded to these points and certainly the wording, as produced, avoided the most obvious pitfalls. We now know better. I say that not because I invite the Deputies opposite to accept as authoritative the views of the Attorney General, not even because I ask them to accept as authoritative the views of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but for this reason. Why were we asked to amend our Constitution? We were asked to do so because a group of distinguished and eminent citizens, many of them prominent in the legal and medical worlds, approached the political parties and said [598] they were unhappy because the Constitution is not specific and does not anywhere specifically assert the right to life of the unborn. They said there was no specific guarantee that the laws against abortion would not be found unconstitutional. At that time they graciously conceded it was highly improbable that the Supreme Court would strike down the laws against abortion but they said it was an area of unique sensitivity and importance and, in those circumstances, that they were entitled to seek certainty. That was a view that won ready acceptance from the public and this House. The situation we have now arrived at is that the wording at present available cannot provide that certainty and cannot achieve the first objective we were asked to deliver on, which was to remove this as a possible area of controversy from the judicial field by putting the matter beyond doubt. It may be that those who originally drafted the wording that now forms part of the Bill will say they are satisfied that the views of the Attorney General are incorrect. They may say they do not agree with the Director of Public Prosecutions and, in time, they might even be proved to be right. However, for them to be proved right would require exactly what we have all be asked to avoid, which is a series of test cases in the Supreme Court as people try to define and examine where the fringes of our laws are to be found. It is important to say that to establish that the present wording is unsatisfactory it is not necessary to persuade any Member of this House that, as a matter of probability, the Attorney General, Mr. Sutherland, is correct. All that is required is to say he might be correct because, if he might be correct, then we are into an area of uncertainty and doubt and we are opening up the way for judicial examination, which was precisely what we were asked to avoid. I will shortly be putting the views of the Attorney General on record and considering them in some detail but, before doing that, something must be said about the way in which the Supreme Court has been referred to throughout this debate. If there is one attitude that seems to unite [599] some of the more extreme supporters of the pro-life cause and the most extreme supporters of the anti-amendment cause, it is a lack of respect for the Supreme Court and an apparent consensus that the Supreme Court lacks even the most basic common sense. On the one hand some of the supporters of the pro-life cause suggest that the Supreme Court would be likely, if invited to do so, to strike down our present 1861 Act and, by doing so, make abortion freely available. I regard that as improbable in the extreme. Deputy John Kelly, a noted constitutional lawyer, has already addressed himself to this point in the debate and I do not want to go over the same ground at any length except to say that on those occasions when the Supreme Court or indeed judges of the High Court have addressed themselves to this issue, far from giving any hint whatever that they proposed at an appropriate moment to strike down the 1861 Act, their observations indicate that, given a chance, they would declare that the unborn does in fact enjoy constitutional rights. Deputy Kelly has already referred to observations in two cases by Mr. Justice Walsh in this regard and Mr. Justice McWilliam in the High Court, who is, interestingly, a member of the minority faith, has made an exactly similar statement. The anti-amendment group, on the other hand, seem to believe that if the Supreme Court is given a chance that, abandoning all common sense, they would accept an interpretation which would put mothers' lives at risk even though another interpretation might be open to them or, alternatively or in addition, they would adopt an interpretation which would legalise abortion up to a very late stage in pregnancy or that they would outlaw many of the contraceptive practices now available here, contraceptive practices which are available to people here precisely because of the action of the Supreme Court. I dislike intensely the manner in which people on both sides of this case have treated the Supreme Court with scant respect. I want to look now at the wording and, in doing so, to say again what our brief [600] was. Our brief was to put this area beyond doubt. Nobody suggested for one moment that the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act was unsatisfactory. As far as I am aware, not even the most enthusiastic members of SPUC have suggested that any changes in that legislation are required. On the reverse side of the coin, apart from a tiny minority of people in the Women's Right to Choose group, nobody has suggested that our law should be changed to provide for abortion. Our instructions, therefore, as a Legislature and our commitment to the pro-life group was to find a wording which would put the status quo beyond challenge and remove the area from the scope of judicial controversy. How does the present wording measure up? At this stage I think it would be appropriate to put on the record of the House the observations of the Attorney General which have appeared in summary in the newspapers. He stated: In summary: the wording is ambiguous and unsatisfactory. It will lead inevitably to confusion and uncertainty, not merely amongst the medical profession, to whom it has of course particular relevance, but also amongst lawyers, and more specifically the judges who will have to interpret it. Far from providing the protection and certainty which is sought by many of those who have advocated its adoption it will have a contrary effect. In particular it is not clear as to what life is being protected as to whether 'the unborn' is protected from the moment of fertilisation, or alternatively is left unprotected until an independently viable human being exists at 25 to 28 weeks. Further, having regard to the equal rights of the unborn and the mother, a doctor faced with the dilemma of saving the life of the mother, knowing that to do so will terminate the life of 'the unborn' will be compelled by the wording to conclude that he can do nothing. Whatever his intention, he will have to show equal regard for both lives and his predominant intent will not be a factor. In these circumstances I cannot approve of the wording proposed.;2057762

144;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. George Birmingham;Fine Gael;I will continue with the quotation which appeared in all of the newspapers yesterday. The Attorney General considered the significance of the word ‘unborn’. He said: [602] The use of the word 'unborn' in the proposed Amendment is significant because it has not to my knowledge been used before in a similar context, that is, as a noun standing on its own. The word is usually taken in association with 'child', 'person' or 'human being'. The word, used as a noun, is not in fact defined in any of the standard English dictionaries. The reason why it is used in the proposal, without any supporting noun, deserves detailed consideration as this is the word which defines the class to be afforded protection. The Irish text of the proposed amendment, which must prevail in cases of conflict and which corresponds to 'the unborn' in the English can be translated as 'the unborn living' or 'the living unborn'. In the event that the Supreme Court is called upon to construe the proposal, it could come to a number of different conclusions as to the definition of the class which is afforded protection. Undoubtedly a view which might commend itself to the court is that all human beings fall within the ambit of the amendment and that a human being comes into existence when the process of fertilisation is complete. It is, I believe, the position of many in the community that the inalienable right to life attaches to the newly fertilised ovum prior to implantation. The consequences of such a definition of the commencement of human life are matters on which medical opinion would be required. If, as would appear to be the case, it is correct to state that certain contraceptives can operate after fertilisation, then these would be abortifacient if human life commences on conception. Thus the importation, dissemination and use of such contraceptives would be prohibited and as an example, the use of the 'morning-after' pill in the treatment of rape victims will not be permissible nor will the use of such contraceptives in certain conditions of the health of a woman — for example, valvular heart disease and diabetes. As I stated earlier, there are however [603] other conclusions that the Supreme Court might reach in defining what is meant by 'unborn'. It might simply conclude that the question cannot be answered definitively. In considering the rights, if any, attaching to life before birth in the United States the Supreme Court there determined that to attempt to reach a conclusion on the issue would be to speculate because 'those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus'. Other conclusions might be that human life commences at the moment of implantation of fertilised ovum or when brain activity commences. Before proceeding with the quotation I will pause to say that as I understood the speech of the Opposition spokesman he made the point that the wording was drafted in the form now before us to try to avoid getting into that area of finesse and it was felt appropriate that the amendment should not come out in favour of any one of those possible beginnings of life. I am open to correction on this. If that is a fair summary then I understand precisely what was in mind but it seems to me to be the precise opposite of what we were asked to do. If that is what the amendment is trying to do, then effectively we are saying that we should put a form of wording into the Constitution and leave it there and any difficulties that arise in interpretation are a matter for the courts at a later stage. It is precisely to prevent the courts being involved at a later stage in determining issues such as when life begins or at what stage protection is afforded that we were asked to draft the amendment. For that reason the amendment, as drafted, fails to measure to the brief we were set. I will continue with the quotation: However, the point of time for which the most compelling legal argument could be made, other than the time of fertilisation, as being the moment of commencement of protection, could be said to be the time when the foetus becomes independently viable. I [604] understand that this is probably at some time between 25 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. Such a construction could be supported by an argument that 'unborn' could be regarded as being applicable only to something capable of being born. The word 'unborn' used as a noun must, as a matter of language, mean 'unborn person', 'unborn child' or 'unborn human being'. It could be argued that neither a fertilised ovum, a fertilised and implanted ovum, an embryo or even a foetus prior to the time when it is independently viable, would come within this definition. The consequences of such a finding could be that there would be no constitutional prohibition on abortion prior to this stage of pregnancy. That is a view that is being put forward. I have no doubt that there are eminent lawyers who would say that that is not the correct view, that it is not what the Supreme Court would decide were they invited to interpret the wording. For precisely the same reason I do not believe they would strike down the 1861 Act. The Supreme Court as constituted at present would interpret the amendment in that matter as a matter of probability. The advocates of the amendment, certainly the Association of Lawyers for the Protection of the Unborn with whom I have been associated from time to time, have readily accepted that they do not expect the Supreme Court as constituted at present to do anything of the sort in relation to the 1861 Act. They are concerned to guard against future developments. Deputies who were in the House when Deputy Kelly was speaking will be told that he gave substance to this argument when he referred to the change of public opinion in relation to contraception and what effect that has had or would have had on anyone who would have come to the courts to challenge the Criminal Law Amendment Act.;2057776

150;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;17.02.83;M;Mr. George Birmingham;Fine Gael;I support the constitutional right as defined by the Supreme Court for married couples to plan their families. Be that as it may, Deputy Kelly made the point that had Mrs. McGee come to the Supreme Court in the fifties and attempted to assert that there was a constitutional right to use contraceptives, it was unlikely, Deputy Kelly said, that she would have got a solicitor or counsel to appear for her. In the sixties it would have been very much odds against and by the seventies she won her case decisively. Because the possibility exists that legal opinion may change over the years an amendment to the Constitution to prevent abortion is appropriate. I have no doubt that the Supreme Court if asked tomorrow what their views on abortion are would say emphatically that abortion is not part of our legal code. I have very little doubt that they would say that anyone attempting to bring in a law providing for abortion would himself be acting unconstitutionally. I have no doubt that that is what a Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice O'Higgins would do. Because I am not a prophet I do not know what Supreme Court judges asked to preside over the same question in 50 years time would decide. Similarly, I think I can guess what the Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice O'Higgins would decide if asked to interpret the meaning of the word 'unborn'. At the very least I think I know what they would not decide. I do not believe that the Supreme Court as constituted at present would interpret the word 'unborn' so as to provide for abortion up to 25 weeks or 28 weeks, but I do not know what they might do in 50 years time. If there is a fear — this has motivated the case for an amendment [606]— that at some distant stage in the future the Supreme Court, no doubt reflecting changes in public opinion, might interpret the silence of the Constitution as drafted at present so as to provide for abortion, is it not equally logical that a Supreme Court which might be so tempted would be equally inclined to seize on any ambiguity in an amendment that we would put in so as to achieve the same result? If those who advocate the amendment argue, as they have argued with cogent and even coercive logic, that we cannot foretell what a Supreme Court would do in 50 years time, it behoves us equally to make sure that what we put into the Constitution is not itself ambiguous. When we consider what is ambiguous or what might have to be condemned as ambiguous, we must consider it not just in the context of what decision a court would be likely to take today but at some distant stage in the future. If we were concerned only with what a court would do today there would be no need for an amendment at all. The Supreme Court as constituted at present would not — I say with great confidence — introduce abortion into our legal system and as an unenumerated right. I will proceed with the next point raised by the Attorney General. The next issue raised by the proposed amendment is the meaning and effect of the words 'with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother'. The meaning of 'with due regard to' is entirely unclear. These words are generally perceived to allow for, at least, termination of the life of the foetus in the cases of ectopic pregnancies or cancer of the uterus. The words 'with due regard to' have been understood by many to suggest that the right to life enjoyed by the unborn was to be confined in some way. That interpretation is in my opinion incorrect. The words 'comh cheart' in the Irish text is literally 'the same right'. The right to life of both the unborn and the mother is stated in the proposed text to be equal and in these circumstances I cannot see how it could be possible knowingly to terminate the existence of the unborn even if such termination was the secondary effect of an operation for another purpose. The issue [607] of intention does not arise in the proposed amendment and thus, it seems to me, that even if termination of the pregnancy is an incidental consequence of an operation to save the life of the mother it would be prohibited. The correct logical interpretation is that the right to life for the unborn is absolute. If a doctor were to be faced with the choice as to saving the life of one and thereby terminating the life of the other, then I believe that the only lawful conclusion to this dilemma would be that he could do absolutely nothing which infringed on either right. It is only where there is no possibility of the foetus surviving even without the doctor's intervention that no difficulty will arise. Whatever about such a clear-cut factual situation, the difficulty of applying the position to other circumstances will be considerable. There may be cases where a doctor will have to consider whether he can treat a prospective mother for an illness which might otherwise shorten her life expectancy if this treatment will threaten the life of the foetus. The proposed amendment will in my view tend to confuse a doctor as to his responsibilities rather than assist him and the consequences may well be to inhibit him in making decisions as to whether treatment should be given in a particular case. In conclusion, the consideration of the [608] points which I have raised is of particular importance having regard to the difference in principle between an ordinary legislative provision and the statement in the Constitution. Whilst a view may be formed as to the likely interpretation of a given constitutional provision at a particular time, such an interpretation is open to review in the future. One is considering in this instance a provision which is intended to stand up to the test of time. This type of constitutional provision by its nature is a statement of broad general principle. The fact that the interpretation of such provision is often a complicated and difficult task is evident from the very many reported judgments on the Constitution which have been delivered by the Supreme Court. I draw attention to the ambiguities in the proposed draft because to do otherwise might suggest that the words are susceptible to only one interpretation. It is further to be borne in mind that this constitutional provision, whilst a statement of general principle, will be susceptible to enforcement in various ways through the civil and criminal law. Uncertainty as to its meaning and effect could have the most serious consequences. Debate adjourned. The Dáil adjourned at 5 p. m. until 2. 30 p. m. on Tuesday, 22 February 1983.;2057782

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;23.02.83;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I have referred to a document produced by the Anti-Amendment Campaign. I will be referring to the matter later. It does not give an address. It has a PO box number, 1285, Dublin 7, and a telephone number. As far as I am concerned, confusion is one of the main strategies, the main aim of the abortion lobby. It could be achieved in various ways. You would have those against the amendment, one way or another those who would be against the wording those who would prefer various types of wording those who would be against abortion but against the amendment, for their own reasons. You could have a whole range of small sectional groups who would be against this for many little reasons of their own. But it is hoped by that abortion lobby that in the confusion the Government might be tempted to abandon the amendment altogether. That abandonment would mean the [979] life achievement of the abortionists and it would not please anybody except themselves. I believe the amendment of the Constitution is not just desirable but essential, because the Constitution does not contain any specific protection for the unborn child. When I say that, I am aware that the amendment will not change the present legal position in regard to abortion. That is not at issue. However, it will do something: it will reinforce the existing law as we know it and it will guarantee that any future decision regarding abortion or the legalising of abortion, or any related matter, will have to be done by a further referendum, the surest guarantee the electorate will have that the majority opinion, which abhors abortion, will be protected. The electorate are entitled to have control of the fundamental policies attached to their rights in this land. Those rights are enshrined in the Constitution and it is important for the electorate that they can recognise them and have them on display. We do not want a situation ever to arise when, because of political gatherings, or groups or interests, or difficulties that might be attached to a particular Government at a particular time because of voting strength, that legislation could be promoted here to give effect to something that the vast majority of the people do not want, namely, to legalise abortion in some shape or form. What a magnificent document the Constitution is. It is a fundamental document that has stood the test of time. Just as it is fundamental as a document it sets out our fundamental rights. I am suggesting that a weakness has been found and it has become mandatory on us, if we have the respect for that document as the protector of our fundamental rights that we should have, to take the necessary steps to bring about a situation that will put that weakness right, that will continue to afford the protection that the vast majority of the people wish to enjoy. The insertion of this amendment in the Constitution will mean simply that abortion cannot and will not be made legal either through legislation or judicial [980] decision. Abortion is prohibited under the 1861 Protection against the Person Act. We might as well face up to it that that piece of legislation could be changed by the Oireachtas any time it likes. It is simply a matter of getting enough marching feet through the lobby. For any reason, through pressure that might be put on a Government not totally in control of their destiny, the marching feet might very well be found to traipse through the lobby to change the legislation. What protection then would the vast majority of our people have against something they abhor, namely abortion? Whatever safeguard there might be because there are people here who would stand their ground no matter what the pressure put on them — there are people here who would prefer to march out the gate rather than have to carry the load if this legislation were changed — there would be no protection at all if the thing could be changed by the courts. It might possibly be changed by the courts in the event of a challenge to the constitutionality of the 1861 Act. Debate adjourned.;2058986
153;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;23.02.83;M;Mr. George Birmingham;Fine Gael;I had all but concluded when I spoke here last week. At some length I had put on record the extracts which had been published of the opinion of the Attorney General on the proposed wording. Since then there has been further public debate on the wording and it is not unfair to suggest, as some have done, that we have been over-cautious in our concern to get the wording right. I do not want to travel the same territory again, but I want to make very briefly and bluntly this point. We have been asked to bring in an amendment not because anybody suggested that the status quo is unsatisfactory, and not because anybody suggested that there is an immediate danger of the Supreme Court upsetting that status quo, but against the possibility that at some date in the medium or long term the Supreme Court might interpret the Constitution in a way not now foreseen. If it is appropriate, and such a view has gained support from both sides of this House, to take account of that possibility in the medium term, then it equally behoves us to take particular account of the wording, and to take into account, not just what the Supreme Court might do today but what it might do at some stage in the future. Earlier I said I was distressed by what seemed to be a lack of respect for the Supreme Court that had emanated from both sides during this debate, but if it is ever the case that we are so ill-served by our Supreme Court that its members would interpret the Constitution as it now stands, and the fact that it is silent on the question of the right to life of the unborn as providing for abortion, is it not equally likely that those members who compose the court would in turn take advantage of any conceivable ambiguity in an amendment to achieve the same results? Does it not make basic, common and logical sense that if we ever had a Supreme Court which wanted to take advantage of the fact that there is no reference in the Constitution, as it now stands, to the right to life of the unborn child, and take the view that there is a personal right to have an abortion, they could place that interpretation [971] on the amendment? Our responsibility is to put the status quo beyond doubt now and for the foreseeable future. We know what the members of the Supreme Court would do under the Constitution as it stands, but we do not know what might happen at some dim and distant date in the future. If anybody who is unconvinced by the views of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions that the amendment as presently drafted is imprecise and vague, may I suggest that the situation would be put beyond doubt if they took the trouble to read the speech by Deputy Woods. On 9 February 1983, at column 1386, volume 339 of the Official Report he said: Despite what would undoubtedly have been the wish of the promoters of this amendment and the majority church in this island, there is no attempt in the wording of the amendment to define the moment at which the life of the unborn begins. The amendment does not attempt to make this definition. Most, of course, would argue that it begins at the time of conception, but this is a matter of theological and scientific argument and in preparing the wording of the amendment we felt it was not appropriate to the Constitution to have such definitions. Deputy Woods, Opposition spokesman for Health and the Minister who had charge of the Bill when first brought before this House, admits openly and without shame that the Bill is deliberately vague, deliberately bland, keeping a foot in both camps and an eye in every direction. We were asked to bring in this amendment for one purpose, and one purpose only, to copperfasten the status quo and to meet the fears that had been expressed by responsible people in the legal and medical worlds. In those circumstances we have an absolute obligation to get this wording right and to ensure that there are no ambiguities and no double think. That means we must look beyond the wording which is being presented to us. In the course of the debate a number [972] of Deputies expressed concern about the tenor of the debate in sections of the media and in the contributions made. Any proposal to amend our Constitution deserves to be seriously examined and scrutinised, and all must be free to engage in that exercise without any fear or pressure that their concern to do their duty as legislators, would leave them open to the charge of somehow being concerned with technicalities and, in an unspecified way, being soft on abortion. Those who attempt to make that sort of point do no service to the cause they seek to promote. I notice Deputy Flynn is sitting on the Opposition benches. He is a good humoured colourful contributor to our debates, one to whom it is a pleasure in times of light relief to listen, but he did himself, his cause and his party no credit when, while in Government, he purported to suggest that the Fine Gael commitment to oppose abortion was in doubt. If he shares our total opposition to abortion — and I have no doubt that he does — he has a responsibility to go a little beyond his usual colourful exchanges and to look very seriously at what he proposes to put before the people. He should ask himself whether, in conscience, he is prepared to put to the people a wording which might, just might, provide for abortion up to perhaps 25 or 28 weeks. It is precisely because we on this side of the House are absolutely determined that no such mistake is going to be made that we are determined to look at this wording very carefully and see that the wording the people are eventually invited to vote on will put the matter beyond doubt.;2058987

Tá siad in aghaidh [973] gin-mhillte agus is ceist bhunúsach é do chuile dhuine. Táimid araon ag iarraidh an daonra a chosaint ar an ghin-mhilleadh. Sin an rud a bheidh romham san méid atá le rá agamsa. I regard this enabling legislation as a very serious business, indeed. It is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation ever brought before this House. Ideally, I would have been very pleased if every single Member could have found the time and the willingness to contribute to this debate, so putting his or her attitude to the whole business on public record. My views on this matter are well known. They have been expressed, not only in the House, but outside in public. It is unnecessary for me to say anything at all on the matter here, but because of my personal attitude towards this legislation and the proposed referendum it is incumbent upon me to put on record my stance. I look forward to many more Deputies taking the same opportunity afforded to them. If we had this type of discussion on a lot more legislation, we would have a real cross-section view of the various elements which go to make up this House. Changing a Constitution, or any part of it, is a matter of considerable importance and seriousness and it will be treated accordingly by me. On 23 March 1982 the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Haughey, indicated on the Government bench opposite to me here that his Government were going to promote this amendment to the Constitution, specifically to protect the right to life of the unborn child and it was in those terms that the Taoiseach of the day initiated this amendment in the Dáil chamber. If we are to believe all that we read in the newspapers, the Attorney General of that time had suggested very many different wordings which might be suitable, or at least might be considered as suitable for the promotion of this amendment. I am not at liberty, even in the privilege of this House, as a former member of that Cabinet, to divulge what went on at the Cabinet table or what documents or memoranda in support of matters were raised in Government and I do not propose [974] to do so. There would seem to have been very educated guesses, to put it at its least, concerning some of that documentation of which I have good memory, because it was a memorandum in which I was particularly interested. From recent reports in the media it would appear that certain people in the media had more than just a casual acquaintance with some of the confidential material submitted in this matter to the Government of which I was a member. We have heard a lot of talk recently about leaks of Government papers——;2058988

This is a very serious matter and leads one to begin to believe that perhaps nothing is confidential in so far as Government papers are concerned. This might not be a proper place to raise such a matter, but it is relevant in that in the very recent past it was obvious to me, as one with a clear memory of some of the memoranda attached to this item, that certainly more than educated guesses were being made by certain people reporting on this issue.;2058990

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;23.02.83;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;——must have had that uppermost in their minds, as well, at the time. Certainly, I would regard it as inappropriate, many years later, that an element of negativeness should venture into [975] any provision for reform of our Constitution. It is easy to be critical about any word or word framework which might be suggested as the proper one, but I uphold the view, as expressed by my leader and my party, of supporting the wording as outlined in the enabling legislation which we are asking the House to pass and in the wording as outlined in Minister Noonan's speech to the House in the recent past. It is easy to be critical of it, or any alternative type of wording. Obviously, certain individuals would not like to have that wording incorporated in the final Act, but it would be extraordinarily difficult to find an alternative wording because, if they had had wording of an alternative nature readily available to them, I am quite sure that they would not have allowed the Minister for Justice to suffer the enormous embarrassment on Second Stage of the Bill — the wording as agreed by us incorporated in the speech — of finding subsequently that somebody said perhaps there should be a rethink on the subject. Two months is a fair time and I would have thought that if an alternative wording were being promoted by the Government as a substitute to what had already been agreed by all in the matter, it was a reasonable period of time in which to find an alternative and promote it. They did not do so. This leads me to think that there is something other than common embarrassment involved as far as the Minister for Justice is concerned. I will try to suggest what might very well be the ploy and strategy of the Government in adopting this divisive tactic which they have employed as far as this legislation is concerned. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister of State when he suggests that this is a very serious business. I agree also that a referendum to bring about an amendment of our Constitution is the ultimate in the democratic process and reflects the real will of the people. To deny that lightly would be a very undemocratic thing to do. It not only reflects the real will of the people but also protects those same people in public from a [976] number of things important in the context in which we speak. It protects them from a certain kind of legislation, from a certain kind of Government trying to protect or promote a certain sectional interest they might wish to legislate for. We are all here familiar with and well aware of political manoeuvring. I suppose that would be regarded as fair game for the day in most things. A certain amount of political manoeuvring goes on otherwise we would not have political parties putting forward various manifestos and programmes to entice people to their way of thinking. Political moods have a big bearing on political activity here also, the moods of individuals, groups of individuals and parties. Particular types of movements and moves have a way of developing at particular times during the legislative process as practised here. The first thing the Constitution does is that it protects the public from certain kinds of legislation, from certain kinds of Legislatures at certain times who might accommodate the interests of certain sections of the community. The Constitution fulfils a second function: it protects the public from certain kinds of judicial rulings. Here I refer to rulings of the Supreme Court when it hands down majority decisions on the existing Constitution that might very well be at variance with the attitudes and principles of the wishes of the majority. That is not unique in our society, decisions being handed down by the Supreme Court that would not find favour with the majority of the electorate. That is another reason we have the Constitution and why it affords some element of protection to the majority point of view. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing more fundamental than human life. Equally I contend there is nothing more democratic than giving the ultimate decision on constitutional matters to the electorate. That is precisely what was in the minds of the Government of which I was a member when they considered bringing enabling legislation into this House for the purpose of getting the decision of the people of Ireland, no more or no less, on a subject on which we believed the majority had a particular [977] wish they would like to express in a certain way. We said we would like to give them that opportunity. Would any one person or persons seek to disallow such a process or such freedom to the electorate? If they would, then they have no place in the democratic process. To deny the electorate the right to decide this matter would simply be undermocratic and we are determined that they will be given that right. Some people would say that the Constitution is the voice of the people. Others would say that the voice of the people is as enshrined here, from the mouths of those people whom the electorate voted to represent them. Whatever attitude one takes on that matter, however one regards it, there is one thing sure: the Constitution does exert a control on Governments. It enunciates the basic rights of the citizens of this State it declares ideals and maintains standards for the common good. These matters are enshrined in our Constitution. But, like any document devised by men or women, it has its limitations it can have weaknesses. It is incumbent on those who represent the electorate at any given time during our lifetime, when they feel that some element of that Constitution has developed a weakness or is in danger of being interpreted in a way that would be contrary to the majority wish, to seek a formula that will put that weakness right. No one politician, no one group of politicians, has the right to think for all the people of this land or to impose a bias on them. That Constitution has served us well we are all agreed on that. It has served as a major bulwark against those who would seek to have it interpreted in a particular way to suit their interests. It has served also as a bulwark against the infringement of our country's rights and on the rights of the individuals who make up that country. It is interesting to pose the question why the pro-life campaign started at all. While it might sound simplistic, I would offer the folowing as at least one good reason it became necessary to have a campaign. I would contend it is as a result of the policy of the referral clinics in certain areas of our country of proceeding [978] by degrees in their campaign for legalised abortion. That 1861 Act has no definition at all of when life begins. There is no doubt at all in my mind but that that Act would have been challenged in the not too distant future. It was going to be challenged by a very vocal, articulate and well-placed minority in our society. They are seeking to impress and impose their aspirations and attitudes on the majority who do not share their permissive latitude in the matter of abortion, and any shilly-shallying now, or any device to thwart or confuse, or worse, to abandon the enabling legislation, as far as I am concerned will be regarded as a victory for the abortionists. I have no doubt if that could be achieved it would accommodate their stated objectives, which is legislation to allow abortion here. They do not put a tooth in it — I will give them that. They print it in their leaflets. The one I have here by the Anti-Amendment Campaign, with a PO box number, states in item 4, without any ambiguity, that the proposed amendment will impede further discussion and possible legislation on abortion.;2058994
161;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;02.03.83;M;Dr. Sean (Tipperary) McCarthy;Fianna Fáil;This Eighth Amendment Bill is one of the most important ever to come before this House. For that reason, it is incumbent upon me to put on record my views on the subject. The organised and very well-orchestrated campaign against the amendment must raise doubts and suspicions in the minds of many as to the true and real motives of these objectors. Many have to go to extreme lengths to explain that, while supporting the anti-amendment campaign, nonetheless they abhor and would never countenance abortion under any circumstances. The true and real reasons for their objections are that the amendment in their view is totally unnecessary, that it promotes sectarianism, or that, when introduced, it could render some methods used under the Family Planning Bill illegal because they could be regarded as abortifacients. All these objections are ill-founded and totally groundless. The vast majority of those who oppose the amendment are not pro-abortionists, per se. However, the fears and doubts created in their minds, in some cases at least, have been fostered and developed by extreme anti-moralists and pro-abortionists on the fringe of the anti-amendment group. Others who belong to the anti-amendment groups can be described [1616] as the professional protesters or classical opposers of this life. They are against everything and basically for nothing, opposing for the sake of opposing, thriving on controversy and could be regarded as reactionaries in every way. I will briefly analyse the reasons given by some of the objectors for their objections. To suggest that the constitutional amendment is sectarian, or might increase sectarianism is inaccurate and unreal. Admittedly, the word 'sectarianism' has gained a new emphasis in this island of ours in recent times and is it any wonder when we have some people, even in high places in this House, obsessed with the concept of sectarianism? It is no wonder that that term is bandied about so much, quite unnecessarily, when the Taoiseach, just over a year ago, described this sovereign State as a sectarian State, when he embarked on what has now become his infamous constitutional crusade, in an effort to create a puralist society. Such utterances by the leaders of our society, and in particular by the leaders of our political parties, are fraught with danger. They give credence to our most bigoted opponents — the Paisleys and others of this life. I am not suggesting that the Reverend Paisley is anti-amendment or pro-abortion — he certainly is anti-abortion — but I am speaking of him as being a bigoted opponent of our sovereign State. This unnecessary talk about sectarianism gives food to our bigoted opponents who despise the traditions which we have established here and which we all intend to continue. They create confusion and worry in the minds of many ordinary, decent people who are genuinely concerned about what is happening here. I hope that the Taoiseach will contain himself in future, or allow his friends to contain him, so that he will not run off at tangents and create more controversy over the next few months or years. The preservation of life of the unborn is an intrinsic component of natural moral law. It antecedes Christianity in all its forms. It is reinforced by the Judeo-Christian tradition which states the command of God, 'Thou shalt not kill'. In Christian thinking all life is given by God [1617] and He is the Sole Master. In human life men are regarded purely as the administrators of God's law. At conception God infuses a spiritual soul into each person. That is why we speak of human beings procreating and of animals reproducing. For this reason to suggest that the enshrinement of the right to life of the unborn in our Constitution would promote sectarianism is totally illogical and quite simply exemplifies the total nonsense being propounded by many of these in the anti-amendment group. To those who fear that, when introduced, as I have no doubt it will be, there will be a real danger of some of the present methods being used under the Family Planning Act being rendered illegal — because then they could be regarded as abortifacients — I would say they need have no fears on that ground. There is not one iota of evidence to substantiate the belief that either the intra-uterine contraceptive device, some of the low oestrogen cycle regulators, or the use of oestrogen following rape prevent pregnancy by interfering solely with the implantation of the fertilised ovum. In fact most experts believe that pregnancy is prevented by either inhibiting the fertilisation of the ovum by the sperm or by inhibiting ovulation. This is not the way an abortifacient works. I would suggest that one can safely and reasonably conclude that these are not abortifacients and do not perform that function. Therefore there can be no real danger of any subsequent changes in the methods used under the Family Planning Act there can be no real danger that any of these methods can be regarded as illegal in the future. To suggest that the amendment is unnecessary because the ban on abortion is covered already by the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 is, to put it mildly, an expression of faith, hope and innocence. This expression of faith hope and innocence was clearly exemplified in other countries over the last ten to 15 years. To suggest that the Supreme Court could not or would not ever create legislation which would introduce abortion, even on a limited scale, has been disproved by what happened in so many [1618] countries. I believe we have here an opportunity to take warning from those events. The protection of the life of the unborn should be absolutely copperfastened in our Constitution once and for all so that no legislation, no legislature can change it in the future, so that the protection of the life of the unborn cannot be changed by anyone for ever more in this country. There is no doubt — and many speakers have referred to this — that there have been several juridicial precedents in relation to the allowing of abortion, initially always on a very limited scale but finally always ending up with abortion on demand being available in other countries. For example, the termination of pregnancy, or the introduction of abortion, was legalised by the United States Supreme Court in 1973 on the basis of personal and marital privacy. Essentially their Supreme Court ruled, in a series of decisions, that the foetus in the first trimester of pregnancy is not a person and that the State may not interfere with the personal decision of a mother to terminate pregnancy, a decision reached by her in consultation with her doctor. The Irish Supreme Court, in the case of McGee versus the Attorney General in 1973, established the legal right to contraception on the basis of marital privacy. Some legal experts have raised already the very strong possibility of this ruling providing a juridicial basis for legislation for the termination of pregnancy or for allowing abortion in this country in the future. As we are all aware, an increasing number of countries have introduced legislation permitting the termination of pregnancy in recent years. Rather interestingly, initially the proponents of legislation advanced their cause primarily on medical grounds. It was argued that certain pregnancies constituted a serious danger to the mother's life and health and that termination, or abortion, was an essential, indeed, life-saving therapeutic procedure. Most responsible medical experts now agree there is no need or justification for termination of pregnancy or for abortion on medical grounds. Most medical experts agree that most of them [1619] have never encountered a case in which it was justified to procure a termination of pregnancy in order to save the mother's life. As a medical practitioner I can say without any reservation that I have never, nor has any of my colleagues, had occasion to deal with a case in which it would or should have been necessary to procure an abortion to save the mother's life. As a result of this medical controversy the direction of legislation on termination of pregnancy has moved from what one might call medical to ideological issues, to questions of social justice and personal rights as interpreted by the Judiciaries in various countries. Gradually the emphasis on termination of pregnancy for medical and medico-social reasons has shifted. Two new important ideas have come to the forefront. First, there is the idea of a woman's absolute right to control her individual pregnancy without reference to the father of the child or to her other children and without reference to the community at large. Second, there is the concept of personal and marital privacy as legalised by the US Supreme Court in 1973. I do not think any of us in this debate should ignore the tragedy of what can happen when abortion is legalised. Abortion, to put it simply, is the wilful deliberate murder of the unborn, and it does not matter one iota whether the unborn foetus is normal or abnormal — every unborn foetus has the right to life. In the UK, an average of 450 abortions, or murders of the defenceless, are carried out every day two million abortions took place in the United Kingdom since 1967 and it is estimated that 19 million abortions took place last year in the US. In other words, more Americans were killed by abortion in the US last year than were killed in the number of wars in which the US was involved. I feel sad to say that most of these abortions were performed by qualified medical practitioners who seem to have forgotten totally the Hippocratic oath, or certainly hold no allegiance to it. Last year throughout the world 55 million people were killed by abortion. What a frightening statistic this is. Only [1620] recently, President Reagan said that the anti-abortion movement in the US is a national effort to redress a great national wrong. The figures quoted are absolutely horrifying, and the amazing thing is how few headlines they seem to have got. It makes one wonder about the basic acceptance of certain so-called sensitive areas — that is a delightful description by some people of certain things — of man's inhumanity to man by allowing these terrifying statistics to pass virtually unnoticed. It seriously questions the credibility and humanity of all of us. If 450 murders a day took place in any country other than the murders of the innocents, if 55 million murders took place throughout the world other than murders of the innocents I have no doubt that the media of the world would show it in banner headlines, yet the minimal amount of publicity given to these figures is something we should all be ashamed of. It is well to realise and to inform ourselves of the fact that termination of pregnancy, or abortion, is not without hazards of mortality and morbidity for the mothers. For example, in England and Wales between 1970 and 1972, 37 maternal deaths occurred from legal abortions. As regards morbidity, the psychic trauma which can affect the woman on whom an abortion has been performed can have very serious consequences. Ekbed in Sweden studied the cases of 479 women who had abortions performed and 25 per cent of them had immediate feelings of guilt. Rather interestingly, it was noticed that one third of that group became pregnant again immediately in the follow-up period. This was referred to by medical experts as the so-called atonement child, often interpreted by the medical profession as being an attempt to undo the guilt created in the mother's mind. It can also be regarded as a creative attempt to recreate life. However, it is not always possible for a mother to respond to loss in a creative fashion. Many women who have had abortions are not consciously aware of psychic trauma but they may have somatic or organic reactions to abortions. Some women who have had abortions develop depression or other psychosomatic [1621] symptoms subsequently, at the time when the baby would have been delivered had it been allowed to survive, or on the anniversary of the abortion. These are well established medical facts. There appears to be no doubt that a rather unique biophyschological and biophysical relationship, a unique attachment or bonding process, develops between the mother and the foetus at a very early stage of pregnancy. The acute grief reaction observed in mothers who give birth to stillborn babies or whose babies die shortly after birth strongly suggests that significant bonding has occurred. We have also seen this acute grief reaction in unmarried mothers who give up their babies for adoption, and this points in the same direction, exemplifying that this special bond has occurred in these cases also. Abortion can then be defined and regarded as a very important and traumatic interruption of a range of deep seated biopsychological and biophysical and social processes that commence at conception and continue to delivery and afterwards. This traumatic interruption can cause many physchic, many physchosomatic and many somatic and organic illnesses all directly related to abortion. The concept of psychic numbing has been introduced to describe the closing off of feeling following a traumatic experience such as abortion. Again, this psychic numbing as it has been called can give rise to many and varied symptoms at a later stage. The question of whether the foetus is a person became a very serious issue in the juridicial decision of the US Supreme Court in 1973. There is no doubt that modern molecular biology regards the foetus as a genetically unique and dynamic human life. At conception, the maternal and paternal chromosomes fuse and a new cell, the zygote, is formed. This is a unique and individual being. Jean Le Joune, Professor of Fundamental Genetics in the University of Paris, says that if a fertilised oocyte is not by itself a full human being, it can never become a man because something would have to be added to it, and we know this does not happen. Science has surely [1622] answered the question of whether or not the fertilised ovum is a person. Clearly the answer is that it is. We are living in an age when we are witnessing the decline of western civilisation, when the population of every western country is dying primarily because of abortion, the increasing use of contraceptives and, in most cases, the death rate exceeds the birth rate except here. We have to ask ourselves do we want to see Ireland join a death queue with the rest of the countries in the western world. Fianna Fáil are committed to supporting this amendment in a referendum. I appeal to all the other parties in this House to stop vacillating on this important issue, to let us proceed with the adequate wording we have, and to stop confusing the public.;2060962

Cuidím go hiomlán leis an mBille seo atá tugtha isteach ag an Aire Dlí agus Cirt ó thaobh prionsabail de. Is é mo thuairimse gurb é seo ceann de na Billí is tábhachtaí a tháinig os comhair na Dála ó bunaíodh an Stát. Dá bhrí sin tá sé ana-thábhachtach ar fad go dtabharfaimís, Teachtaí Dála, breithiúnas ceart, cruinn agus géar ar an mBille seo. I support absolutely the principles of this Bill, which is the first step towards holding a referendum on an amendment to the Constitution to safeguard the right to life of the unborn. Let me state clearly and categorically, despite personal reservations that might have been expressed by some of my party colleagues both inside and outside the House, that Fine Gael stand totally committed to holding the referendum. We recognise the need to take the steps that are necessary to ensure that the right to life of the unborn child will be protected, clearly and unequivocally. We recognise that the best and surest way of achieving this objective is to amend the Constitution to include in it specifically this right to life. The reasons for taking this course of action are straightforward. Unfortunately the issues have been clouded in what has developed into a public controversy, loaded with legal jargon and medical terminology. The arguments in favour of an amendment to the Constitution and to the holding of a referendum are straightforward and absolutely defensible. I do not speak as a lawyer or as a doctor but as an elected representative of the people, with no medical or legal qualifications to pronounce scientifically on the issues before the House. As a layman I regard the arguments as clear and straightforward. First, the Constitution as it stands does not contain an explicit protection of the right to life of the unborn child. This is a fact that cannot be contradicted. Secondly, there are the views [1596] expressed by Mr. Justice Walsh some years ago arising from a famous case in the Supreme Court and they had been referred to by many people, particularly outside this House. The views expressed by Mr. Justice Walsh were what is known in legal terminology as obiter dictum. They are not binding either on himself or other Supreme Court judges in deciding any future Supreme Court cases. Although some people might think to the contrary, unanimity by the Supreme Court would not be required for a decision declaring the 1861 Act unconstitutional. A simple majority is all that is necessary. Legalised abortion could be made possible by a majority decision of the Supreme Court on a technical legal point. This would not involve consultation with or mandate from the people. It is worth observing, as many commentators have done, that if the Supreme Court followed the precedent set by the US Supreme Court they could find the 1861 Act unconstitutional. Despite the controversy surrounding the issue the truth is that the overwhelming majority of the medical and legal profession support the argument for amending the Constitution and holding a referendum. The overwhelming majority of the people when given an opportunity in the referendum will also support the proposed amendment. The best medical and legal brains have given careful thought to the question of holding a referendum to protect the life of the unborn. They have openly supported the campaign to secure a constitutional amendment. Unfortunately, the matter has become the subject of controversy and doubts have been expressed about the wording proposed by the previous Government. The Minister for Justice, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions have expressed doubts and reservations. The majority of my colleagues and Members of the House and the majority of the people want to see a referendum held as quickly as possible but we would be failing in our duty as public representatives if we did not give due consideration to the doubts expressed by the Attorney General. If a [1597] better wording than the formula proposed by the previous Government can be found, then everything will be happy. I wish to make my position crystal clear. When I speak about an alternative formula or wording I mean a wording which will express more clearly and precisely the objective we wish to achieve. Any side-stepping or backtracking from the basic fundamental objective of this proposed amendment will have to be rejected. If we get a better wording, so much the better. If we do not, let us proceed with the wording we have and give the people an opportunity to exercise their democratic right and make a decision on this important matter. There has been much talk about a wording which will allay the fears and doubts expressed by the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. What is important is that the amendment being put to the people must clearly and unambiguously set down the inalienable right to life of the unborn. No loophole must be left which would enable the basic fundamental right to life of the unborn to be interfered with either by the Oireachtas or by the Supreme Court. This is what I want to see achieved in the amendment. As I say, doubts have been expressed by the legal authorities about the proposed wording and whether it will achieve the objective we all desire. Any kind of new wording which will weaken this basic objective is unacceptable. There can be no backtracking from the objective to which we have committed ourselves. The Constitution must be amended. A referendum must be held as soon as possible and the best form of wording must be found which will copperfasten in the Constitution a clear and unambiguous provision protecting the unborn child from conception to birth. No other form of amendment can be accepted. It would not be acceptable to me and I will vote accordingly when the time comes in this House. I wish to refuse certain allegations which have been made in relation to the pro-life amendment. It has been suggested inside and outside the House and in the media that the pro-life movement [1598] was initiated by a band of cranks and fanatics who are conservative, ultra-traditional and shooting the traditional Roman Catholic line. I have taken time to look into the origin of the pro-life movement and I utterly refute this. I have looked at the credentials and professional standing of the people who lent their names to the movement. I am not being pressurised by the pro-life movement or any other movement to take a particular stand in this House. I have been a Member of the House for 22 years and have always been my own man. I make up my own mind on issues. I am incensed at the attempt made to discredit a group of caring people, reputable citizens of this State with international reputations in the medical and legal field. In the pro-life amendment document there is a list of the main patrons of the movement. In the medical profession there is a list of the most eminent people in the field of gynaecology obstetrics, including four university professors of gynaecology and obstetrics. Can they be described as a small vocal pressure group shooting the traditional line? From the beginning the campaign for an amendment to the Constitution to protect the right of the unborn was supported by a reputable organisation. I was very impressed by the speech made by Deputy Rory O'Hanlon who is a medical doctor. He referred to the fact that the Irish Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union at their annual general meeting unanimously passed resolutions condemning abortion. Eminent medical patrons have lent their names to the pro-life movement. It is also supported by the Irish Nurses' Organisation, Muintir na Tíre, Lawyers in Defence of the Unborn and so on. I totally reject any suggestion, made inside or outside this House that the people who are trying to secure an amendment to the Constitution are irresponsible, narrow-minded, conservative, traditional and solely concerned with promoting the dogma of one religion. On the other hand, let us look at the anti-amendment movement. What weight do the people who have lent their names to this campaign carry, professionally or otherwise? I have here the anti-amendment [1599] campaign leaflet in which they have set out their objectives, one of which is that the amendment will impede further public discussion and possible legalisation of abortion. That is what they are concerned about. The organisations mentioned here are The Communist Party of Ireland, Dublin Well Woman's Centre, The Democratic Socialist Party and the right-to-choose group. There is a long list of individuals, two of whom were Members of this House when the campaign was started but who, strangely enough, are no longer Members. I have studied the leaflet and objectives of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign and those of their opponents. I have no doubt whatsoever in arriving at a balanced judgment on this matter. The people who initiated a campaign to secure an amendment to the Constitution have rendered a very valuable national service and our gratitude should be extended to them. Because of their deep concern arising from their professional expertise and their lifelong work, especially in the medical profession, they recognise the danger and have called on their elected representatives to ensure that we will stand out as a country with a caring society who care for the under-privileged. The Minister for Health had a right to express his personal views on this matter when he said that an amendment to the Constitution will not stop people going to the UK for abortions and that we should be more concerned about the unmarried mother and so on. The Minister is now in an ideal position to do something positive to help the unmarried mother. I am very proud to be associated with CURA, which has as its special objectives the care of unmarried mothers. The work of this organisation is impeded through lack of financial support and most of their excellent work is supported through voluntary donations and subscriptions. If the State and the Government are concerned about this situation let us put our money where our mouths are and ensure that these organisations will get adequate finance. We are doing it out of our own pockets in Limerick and I am proud of that. Let us [1600] show that we care about our under-privileged people and unmarried mothers. Let us ensure that local authorities will put an unmarried mother and her child on a special priority list for housing. Let us not be talking about ideology or liberalism but let us do something practical to help these unfortunate people. I have no doubt that medical arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of an amendment to the Constitution to protect the right to life of the unborn from conception to birth. While doubts have been expressed by the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and by individual lawyers, we must not lose sight of the fact that there is an organisation of lawyers supporting the pro-life campaign. The Irish Association of Lawyers have a membership of over 300. At a recent meeting in Killarney they fully endorsed the campaign for securing an amendment to the Constitution. It has also been stated by those who are opposed to the amendment that it is sectarian and will demonstrate to the world that we are a sectarian State dominated by Rome and its teachings. There is propaganda in the media that the non-Catholic Churches are united and unanimous in their opposition to the amendment. I have looked into this and I was very impressed and pleased to find a public statement read on 8 February 1983 by the Rev. Sydney Garland, on behalf of Ministers of four Protestant denominations, at a news conference in Dublin. He said We` do not accept that the proposed Amendment is sectarian. Abortion is not an exclusively Roman Catholic issue. It is a matter of basic human rights. The right to life of the unborn is based on the indisputable scientific fact that human life begins at fertilisation.... There is nothing sectarian about these facts. The medical evidence concerning the beginning of human life does not change whether you are a Catholic or Protestant.... The Amendment is entirely in accord with our Protestant view of abortion. ...Clearly there are differences among Protestants on the issue of abortion. [1601] ...However, we believe that the majority of Protestants will support the proposed Amendment. He went on to say — I presume he was referring to the Churches he had mentioned — that: The Church statements are out of step with grass-roots opinion on this issue. They are also out of step [this is the important point] with the other Protestant denominations which are not part of the Irish Council of Churches. Furthermore, they are out of step, not only with the whole Christian tradition which has unanimously condemned abortion, but also with their own Protestant heritage on the issue. We then had allegations that the proposed amendment was sectarian. We have been told that to proceed with it would worsen our relations with the non-Catholic community in Northern Ireland. Reverend Garland in the course of that statement also adverted to that aspect. He said: We do not accept that a Pro-Life Amendment to the Republic's Constitution would worsen relations with the Protestants of Northern Ireland. In fact, this is one area where there is opportunity for agreement and a common approach. It is a fact that Protestants have been in the forefront of LIFE, a pro-life organisation which is growing rapidly in Northern Ireland. Reverend Garland concluded by saying that: If the Pro-Life Amendment is passed, then many in Northern Ireland and throughout the world will rejoice and will be encouraged to fight for an end to the silent and sinister holocaust of abortion, and the universal recognition of the right to be born. That answers the suggestion being projected in the media that the proposed amendment is sectarian. In recent times the media have adopted an unbalanced aproach. If one examines the coverage in [1602] the media one will find that the balance is very much behind the anti-amendment campaign. In recent months I issued three public statements on the Pro-Life Amendment but not one word was published. However, when some of my colleagues expressed reservations about the issue they received headlines in all newspapers and in RTE. I sent three scripts to RTE supporting the Pro-Life Amendment but they did not use one word. The statement by Reverend Sydney Garland must be taken carefully. In connection with suggestions that the proposed amendment is sectarian I should like to quote from the Report of the Public Morals Committee of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church entitled, Abortion, A Matter of Life and Death. The preface to that report states: The purpose of this report is to place before the members and friends of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church both the facts relating to abortion and the Christian case against it. Today, in many circumstances, the unborn child is on trial. He is charged with a variety of offences his presence is inconvenient, he is liable to disclose the promiscuity, sexual laxity or extra-marital infidelity of his parents, he is accused of placing undue stress on his mother, father and other brothers and sisters. For these and other ‘crimes’ he is condemned to death. The pro-life movement seeks to ensure that the life of the unborn from conception or fertilisation to birth is safeguarded. The Supreme Court at some future date by a simple majority may find the 1861 Act unconstitutional. I have referred to the danger that would occur if the Supreme Court followed the US precedent, and it has been known to do that. The fundamental aspect of the debate is, when does life begin. In regard to this I came across an interesting book — one of the many I came across dealing with this issue, not all pro or anti-amendment — entitled, Abortion: The Silent Holocaust by John Powell. That book is relevant to the discussion that is taking place here and outside. Under the heading [1603] of 'Congressional Hearings' Mr. Powell stated: On April 23 and 24, 1981, the US Congress took the historic step of holding hearings on 'The question of when human life begins'. In its decision legalising abortion-on-demand, the Supreme Court asserted that it could not resolve 'the difficult question of when human life begins,' and so the Court proceeded to legalise abortion throughout the full nine months of pregnancy. One medical school professor, Dr. Eugene Diamond, has said [in referring to this decision] that 'either the justices were fed a backwoods biology or they were pretending ignorance about a scientific certainty'. There is 'a curious avoidance of the scientific fact, which everyone really knows, that human life begins at conception'. At that Senate hearing a long line of the most eminent geneticists, gynaecologists, obstreticians and experts on various fields of medicine and biology gave evidence. Their testimony before the hearing was unanimous. Dr. Harold W. Manner, Chairman of the Department of Biology at Loyola University of Chicago summed it up as follows: When a human sperm fertilises a human egg, the result is a human being — from the moment of conception. His final sentence is very relevant to the motivation and raison d'etre of the proposed amendment: The killing of this living human being must be considered homicide. There is no doubt that from the scientific evidence available — one does not have to be a scientist, a biologist, a geneticist, a gynaecologist or an obstretician to interpret the evidence — life begins at conception. What is being sought in the amendment is a clear and unambiguous statement protecting the unborn from conception to birth so that the matter will not be subject to the whims of the Oireachtas or decisions of the Supreme Court. This matter must be decided by [1604] our people in a referendum. Some of the literature I have read on this matter in recent weeks is horrifying. There is a body of opinion now which talks of handicaps to the foetus that can be detected by the use of modern scanning equipment and suggests that a foetus that may be handicapped at birth should now be destroyed. This is appalling. It must be apparent to everybody in this country, because, irrespective of political philosophy, we subscribe to a Christian philosophy of life and a concept of a just society to which, unfortunately, only lip service is paid very often, that, the handicapped should be a source of great pride and joy to us. Over the past decade or two a new awareness of the handicapped has grown up in this country. Thousands of people give practically all their spare time in a voluntary effort to provide accommodation, facilities and training for the handicapped. We have such organisations in my constituency and I am sure in other constituencies throughout the country. This debate has gone on for quite a long time. Perhaps it is good that an issue of this gravity, probably one of the most important Bills ever to come before the House for several years, should be debated at length. To sum up, I suppose in the final analysis one must be guided by the dictates of one's own conscience, but there is such a thing as an informed conscience. I have looked at this objectively. I have discussed it with many people. I have tried to interpret a case for and against the amendment. I am satisfied beyond year or nay that the arguments in favour of the amendment are absolutely overwhelming. Secondly, having agreed to hold the referendum, we must be careful to ensure that the best possible wording is formulated which will ensure that the right to life of the unborn will be safeguarded independently of the Oireachtas, independently of the Supreme Court and independently of any international institution, be it the Court of Human Rights, the EEC Court of Justice or any other court. In conclusion I emphasise what I have said. If the alternative amendment is to be available then I hope it will be available [1605] in the very near future. It is undesirable that there be any undue delay and I hope that the alternative amendment, the alternative wording for which we have been waiting for three or four weeks now, will be available very shortly. As I said at the very beginning, I re-emphasise with all due deliberation that if the alternative wording which will be available to us will copperfasten the objective that we want to achieve, then we will have done a good day's work. On the other hand, and I want to state my position clearly, if a hotch-potch of words or a new formula comes in which will not achieve the objective of safeguarding the right to life of the unborn from conception to birth independently of the Dáil and the Supreme Court, then I will vote against it. I make that quite clear. I am perfectly honest about these things. If the alternative wording is not to my satisfaction and better than the wording already before the House I will vote for what is already before the House. Before I conclude I want to address myself to international institutions, international courts and so forth. I am proud to be a member of the Fine Gael Party and affiliated to the European Christian Democrats. During the course of the European election campaign in 1979 — this has not been adverted to by anybody — a fundamental principle of the European election manifesto which was put before the people of Europe and which we put before the people of this country was a commitment to the basic concept of the right to life of the unborn. This is written in black and white, unambiguously and clearly, into the Christian Democrat election manifesto of 1979. I want to say in the context of the EEC which has been referred to here by a number of speakers and referred to outside the House also, that there was a major debate in the European Parliament in November 1981 at Luxembourg when a very substantial, significant and thoroughly researched report was presented to the Parliament on all aspects of women's rights. There were pro-abortion advocates there who were MEPs and the debate was pretty acrimonious. Commissioner Richard, Commissioner for Social [1606] Affairs, if I remember correctly, stated clearly and emphatically that the EEC could not force this country or any member country to introduce abortion legislation. There was nothing in the Treaty of Rome which would force the EEC, the Commission, the Parliament, the Courts of Justice or any other EEC institution to do so. However, if we do our job properly in this amendment and in this referendum we will be ensuring that such a fundamental case as the inalienable right to life of the unborn will not be subject to interference from any international institution or any court of justice in Ireland, Europe or otherwise or will not be interfered with by the Oireachtas either except with expressed consent of the Irish people in a referendum.;2060963
163;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;02.03.83;M;Mr. Ruairí Quinn;The Labour Party;I rise to speak against this amendment for a number of reasons. I trust that my current 'flu and cold will not cause me to grate on the ears of the House. Perhaps the two doctors seated across from me might offer me some medical advice as distinct from the unacceptable political advice I had to listen to for the past half hour from my friend and colleague, Deputy McCarthy. The task which faces this generation of politicians on this island on both sides of the divide confronted no previous generation of politicians. At no time in our history has a generation had thrust upon itself such a responsibility and found itself without the kind of answers which were available in previous times. It is truly frightening to be a politician in these times. There seems to be a direct relationship between the increase in the level of the problem and the decrease in the range of solutions on the other hand. All of us in this House share one common bond, that is, our commitment to the democratic process. All people outside this House are looking to us to solve democratically and peacefully the problems of which we are so painfully aware. We know that in all our constituencies in an invisible line standing behind us — and we have had to confront them and meet them at different times — is an [1623] array of people who put themselves forward as being capable of solving the problem in a non-democratic fashion to an increasingly growing audience of young people, and not so young people, and not confined to the Six Counties of this island. The House may ask: what has this got to do with the amendment? I thank the Chair for his indulgence in allowing me to develop the argument. I make that point to set the context within which we are currently debating this rushed and panic measure to change the Constitution in a most substantial way. For what purpose? I would argue, as I have argued on different occasions in this House from different sides, that since 1921 the central problem at the root of all difficulties which the island of Ireland has experienced has been the unnatural division within this country. It has prevented the evolution of what might be regarded as more normal or balanced politics. In the South it has given us the legacy of a bitter civil war which still sputters and fires from time to time in a most unacceptable manner within the confines of this House. North of the Border it has produced a narrow, tight, sectarian State which has had to repress 30 per cent to 40 per cent of its population simply to survive. The current difficulty of Partition is well known to Members of the House. It has riven the Fianna Fáil Party from top to bottom since the arms crisis. It has caused great dissension within my own party. The Workers' Party are a product of a split on Northern Ireland and the Irish question. For every hour of energy which we as politicians and democratic organisations give to trying to resolve that problem, an hour of energy is taken away from addressing ourselves to the real problems of health, education, housing and jobs. It is doing more than that. It is costing us a fortune in terms of security, in terms of taxation raised to finance that security, in terms of the forfeiting of tourism and industrial development. This is the effect violence North and South, but particular North of the Border, has had upon our image abroad. [1624] That is the overall context within which a very small group of people were able to propose to an unsuspecting body of politicians the idea that somehow it would be very good to have a referendum to change the Constitution to copperfasten a bar on any legislation which would make abortion legal. I have no doubt that they are sincere people, and that they are well motivated and highly moralistic. They were not politicians if they thought any political party, if they were a serious political party, were remotely capable of proposing to change the legislation governing abortion. They managed to blackmail — and I use the word advisedly — the vast majority of politicians and the two major political parties into signing the consent on their forms. The timing of those forms was related to election time, and we all get nervous at election time. Suddenly we find that the Constitution is to be amended hurriedly, with a clear commitment from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael most injudiciously given in my view and in the view of many people in the Fine Gael Party, notably Deputy Kelly. After the most recent change of Government, in December of last year the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions issued the following statement in relation to the proposed amendment: The Executive Council has considered the proposal to amend the Constitution in respect to the right to life of the unborn and, in particular, the amendment proposed in the Bill issued by the last Government. The Executive Council believes that such an amendment is unnecessary and that it would be unwise and undesirable to proceed with it. The amendment to the Constitution is undesirable in that matters of this kind should be the concern of elected representatives in Parliament, and, in that statute law is the proper means of dealing with them as is the case in all democratic countries. It is unwise in that the rigidity and inflexibility of constitutional directives on social and moral issues is inappropriate in a democracy. Indeed grave [1625] doubt about the wisdom of using constitutional prohibitions as a means of dealing with complex moral and social problems has already been expresed by one of the main Churches in Ireland. The amendment is unnecessary in that the position is covered by existing law and there is no compelling reason why it should now be dealt with by altering the Constitution. The wording of any constitutional amendment on this matter must inevitably be vague, uncertain and imprecise, something which is undesirable in a Constitution which purports to lay down basic rights. It is particularly inappropriate that such an important matter should be the subject of arcane argument by constitutional lawyers construing language when it can be adequately dealt with by legislation under the Constitution as it stands. Congress has been disturbed at the emotional and at times hysterical manner in which the constitutional amendment has been approached in public discussion and particularly at the hypocritical way in which the two main parties have attempted to take advantage of the genuine concern of people with the grave issues that are involved. Political cant has been abundantly evident in the controversy. There is a pressing need for radical reforms in family law, particularly as regards marital breakdown and the rights of children. These are matters that must be given priority attention. Legislative action here would make a significant contribution to human welfare and well-being and go some way towards ensuring that all our children are cherished equally. Amending the Constitution in the way proposed will contribute nothing to improving the human situation nor will it help to resolve the dilemma faced by many thousands of women annually in this sensitive matter. I want to stress that what we are talking about is the reason and the argument for amending the Constitution. It is easy for the proponents of this amendment to say that they are against abortion, and that that is the reason they are supporting the [1626] amendment. Abortion is not the issue in this legislative debate, although I know that most people in favour of the amendment like to make out that case. Deputy McCarthy devoted the major proportion of his speech attempting to make, as the statement from Congress said, a somewhat hysterical speech in relation to statistics of abortion throughout the world. Since abortion is illegal in this State, since there are no proposals to bring in any form of relaxed law in relation to abortion and since the vast majority of people are against abortion, it is most unlikely and most improbable that abortion will be democratically legalised here. I will return in a moment to the alternative fear expressed by some pro-life Members regarding the Supreme Court. I want clearly to lay down the first marker. This debate is not about abortion. It is about using the Constitution in a particular way which reflects the private moral view of what happens in this instance to be the view of the vast majority of people on this island but doing it in what is clearly a sectarian way because a number of minority Churches have said clearly that they would prefer if the Constitution were not amended in this way. For that reason and because of my opening comments setting out the background in which all politicians have to work, I am opposed totally to this amendment or to any other similar amendment that will make the central task of politicians on this island more difficult than it is at present. Rather than providing secondary evidence for recalcitrant Unionists in the North, as this undoubtedly will be so used, we should slowly and surely be dismantling any such evidence that would make it impossible for them to enter into discussions that would ultimately result in a new Ireland. We have seen what the past the years have done north and south of the Border. I am opposed to any amendment. Therefore, for me, the discussion as to the formula of words is a secondary one and is not relevant to the central argument. Many talented and respected legal people have tried to work out a formula of words that would square the fine lines of precision embodied in judicial judgments [1627] with the vagueness and openness that surrounds the circle of moral views and they have found the reconciliation of both virtually impossible from the legal point of view. That is the dilemma of the present Attorney General and clearly it was the dilemma of previous Attornies General. Senior legal and medical experts have expressed the view, irrespective of their own views on abortion — the vast majority of them are against abortion as I am myself — that it is inappropriate and virtually impossible to use the Constitution as the instrument for copperfastening a ban on legal abortion. Let us be quite precise on this point, we are talking about legal abortion. Fear has been expressed by a number of people — Deputy McCarthy referred to it — that this amendment, if enacted in its present form, could seriously or totally interfere with certain forms of contraceptives in use in Ireland. I am not a lawyer or a doctor and I do not have the expertise to express a technical view on the matter but I have listened to and I have seen the names of those who have expressed serious reservations about the implications from the point of view of health and family planning and also the legal point of view. Their views should be taken into account but today I have not heard a sufficiently strong counter-argument from the other side nor have I read such a counter-argument in the debates that have taken place so far. We have heard a lot of emotional speech-making on the horror of abortion. This country, perhaps more so than any other in Europe, does not have an indigenous position on abortion — unlike Eastern Europe where it is regarded as a normal form of family planning, however brutal and appalling that may be to Members of the House. That is the norm in Greece and Yugoslavia and parts of central Europe with strong Christian and Moslem traditions. Since we have no great tradition of abortion culturally or historically, even going back to Celtic times, why is it that so many Irish women travel to England to have abortions? Would it not be worth while to undertake research into this phenomenon? [1628] Most people recognise that abortion is a terrible decision for anyone to make and in a sense is an admission of a mistake. The best way to eliminate the problem is to eliminate the cause. The way to elminate the cause is to develop proper comprehensive family planning measures in our society. Despite the fact that we spend £1,000 million of taxpayers' money on health services, approximately 25 per cent of the total tax take by the Government in any one year, and more per capita on health and health care than any other European state, as Deputy O'Hanlon will agree, we spend little or nothing on family planning or research into what is happening. We frequently boast that we have the highest rate of population growth among EEC countries. We boast about it until the children who are the products of such boasts reach the age of six or seven years and have to go to school. We then find we do not have the political will to raise the wealth necessary to provide schools, houses and jobs for them. Any change in the Constitution should be entered into slowly after much discussion and consultation having regard to the situation on this island and the difficult relations between North and South and Dublin and London. I find it appalling that the former Taoiseach in what was manifestly a political ploy, should give a commitment on the dissolution of the Dáil last November to hold this referendum by 31 March 1983 and, equally so, that Leader fo Fine Gael should give an undertaking to match that commitment and say he would go along with it as would his party. As a politician I can understand the motivation for that. However, I thought that as a nation we were trying to get away from that kind of politics. As a ploy it did not work on either side. We should honestly say to the people that in our heart of hearts this referendum is something about which no political party is very happy. For reasons which they would prefer not to go into, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were trapped or blackmailed into a position where they gave an undertaking which in a different time and a different island they would like to take back. That is not to say either [1629] party is soft on the question of abortion. Of all the things that need changing in the Constitution — this House will agree on a few of them — this does not rank high in the list or priorities because there is no proposal to change the law. Changing the Constitution will not change the reality of thousands of women travelling to England each year to have an abortion. Politicians on all sides have bowed to a certain devaluation of the democratic process because of this blackmail procedure. As recently as two weeks ago coming into the House, having indicated that I was against the amendment but also against abortion and saw a distinction between the two, I was accosted by someone who said: 'You cannot adopt the two positions and in any case we know you and you are not saying what you believe'. It is that kind of argument which has put many politicians reluctantly into a position of having to play safe on this issue. As the argument unfolds and step by step is distanced from the separate issue of abortion and seen for what it is — an amendment on its own, independent of any other issue, to amend the Constitution to achieve a function for a particular purpose on behalf of a group at this time in our history — it is seen by many young people as further evidence of the increasing irrelevance of Irish politics and how much out of touch with reality the Legislature has become. I fear this House will again be tempted to take the safe, easy option and go for an Irish solution to an Irish problem. Like history which repeats itself in tragedy and in farce, this time the irony is that there is not even a problem. It is an Irish solution to an Irish mirage brought about by a skilful group of people. I admire the skill with which they lobbied politicians, not the methods they used. The effect they achieved must be admired. I fear the damage they will do to our Constitution if they are successful as, regrettably, I fear they will be. I also fear the damage they will do to the democratic process upon which we are dependent. I should like to quote from some of the speeches made on this subject to date. I [1630] shall start with perhaps the most eminent constitutional lawyer in the House and in the State. At column 1396 of the Official Report Deputy Kelly said in relation to Deputy Woods's speech: Where was there any reference in his speech to the legal emergency in this country ... which calls for this constitutional fire brigade action we are witnessing here today? Further down, at column 1400, he stated vis-à-vis the argument put forward regarding the claim that the Supreme Court would overnight somehow or other legalise abortion——;2060964
164;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;02.03.83;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I was making the case last week for proceeding in the immediate future with the pro-life amendment, giving the people the opportunity to voice their opinion on this matter. I outlined the need for constitutional change in this area and also the need for positive wording such as that used in the other sections of the Constitution. I pointed out the undeniable right of the population to express their point of view by way of referendum on this very important subject. I further dealt with the dangers of changes coming about in the current position in relation to abortion, either through legislative processes or through a judicial ruling from the Supreme Court by a majority decision. I concluded then by stating the need to reinforce existing law as outlined in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. [1576] The amendment proposed by this Bill would mean that abortion could not be made legal either through legislation or by a judicial decision of the Supreme Court. Such an amendment is most desirable. We are all aware that abortion is prohibited under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, but we also know that this can be changed at any time by the Oireachtas and by any Government who would choose to have a majority in favour of such a change. If it were changed by the courts, this would take place without any consultation. At least a proposed change in legislation would be debated in this House. We are all aware that three of the five Supreme Court judges can overturn existing law if they take a certain view as to its interpretation. It is well to bear in mind the pertinent example of the United States where abortion became legal through a decision of their Supreme Court in 1973. The whole question of legalising abortion in America started off on the question of marital privacy and led some time afterwards to the concept of procreative privacy. We must recognise that marital privacy has also been accepted in Ireland and there is no reason to expect that things would be any different here after a certain passage of time. That is one of the fundamental reasons for the initiation of the pro-life amendment campaign. To delay now would be to make uncertain the protection of the right to life and it is for that simple reason that I take the stand I do. The referendum to bring about an amendment to the Constitution will not stop abortions. Many people have been trying to confuse the issue by suggesting that it might do so but there is no doubt that this will not be the case. We must be realistic and admit that it is not likely to happen. The onus of responsibility will certainly be on the Government and the powers that be to provide support for those with unwanted pregnancies. Subsequent to the inclusion of this amendment in the Constitution, there would be a strong onus of responsibility on the State to do everything humanly and legislatively possible to provide the necessary support for those who are unfortunate [1577] enough to see abortion as the solution to their problem. We will have to take great notice of the influence being exercised by certain agencies in relation to what is regarded as the abortion trail from this country to Britain. I have no doubt that the abortion referral agencies — apparently operating without any interference in this country, despite the fact that I believe they are operating outside the law — are creating a demand for abortion. They are doing nothing to provide the kind of support or the kind of alternatives that might help to find a solution to this problem. Many of the abortion referral clinics in their attitude towards abortion, and in the attitude they are selling to their clients, would have people believe that it is fashionable and acceptable in modern times to have abortion made freely available and that referring people to clinics outside the State is the proper and most fashionable thing to do at this time. I regard the campaign being pursued by those people as a policy of stealth. It is certainly an erosion of the traditional standards and concepts we have come to accept as part of the normal situation here. It is a clever tactic and it is very easy to see the reason for their vociferous reaction to this Bill. When the pro-life amendment becomes part of our Constitution it literally slams the door before their strategy of gradualism, which I referred to on the last occasion we discussed the Bill. That strategy is as evident in our society as it ever has been in promoting a particular concept. In this instance it is the acceptability of abortion. By easing it along and instilling it in the minds of those who come to seek their aid, these agencies and clinics are bringing about a situation where they would like to feel that abortion is acceptable. But they know that if this amendment becomes part of the Constitution it denies them, as is stated in their anti-amendment literature, the opportunity of pressing on with their campaign to have legalised abortion here. We speak of human life. As far as I am concerned, human life exists from the time of conception or, as one likes to call [1578] it, from the time of fertilisation. I believe it to be a scientific proven fact. The fundamental right of human life is the right to life itself. I do not believe the fundamental right to life is the preserve of any particular denomination or religious group in our society. It is mischievous to suggest that only the Roman Catholic Church support the amendment to the Constitution we are now discussing. It is well known that the usual tactic in other latitudes — some of them close to home — is to use the anti-Catholicism trick as a subtle but very productive tactic of liberalism. The attempt to label Roman Catholicism as the last bastion of conservatism against social progress is not new. It has been used over the centuries, and with great effect in one particular democracy, the USA. If you can get the anti-Catholic label attached to something then it is a great help towards promoting liberalism in any particular social change one might like to introduce. We have to recognise the very considerable influence of the mass media. I have no doubt that the pro-abortionist lobby have been very assiduous in courting that favouritism from the media. That is why it is so important in something as fundamental as this that a proper balance is maintained as far as discussion is concerned. Our mass media have been very fair in their attitude to date in dealing with this matter. That has not been the case in other democracies. In America you virtually have to have the media on your side if you wish to promote any particular change in any walk of life whatsoever. That is not the position here and, hopefully, it will never be the case. The liberalism that is sometimes expressed in some of the promotions sold for public consumption does not necessarily reflect the attitude of a lot of the readers of those publications. I do not want to refer to the USA ad nauseam but there is no doubt that if you wish to have a particular point of view sucessfully sold and legislated for in America then you must have a very big propaganda machine to court the support of the mass media. It would be a pity if liberalism had that kind of support from the media here. There has been quite a lot of talk about [1579] the desire to have a pluralist society here. A pluralist society must have a basic respect for life. This is a basic requirement for all communities. If the State seeks to gurantee the basic right of life, how can it offend pluralism? The two things cannot be separated. How can respect for the other rights be achieved if respect for human life is absent? The anti-amendment lobby are simply trying to impale the Taoiseach and his Government on the pluralist hook. That was very evident in one of their publications. I am referring again to a small pamphlet which has been circulated by the anti-amendment campaign operating from a post office box somewhere in the city. This document states: We believe Dr. FitzGerald has no choice but to oppose this sectarian amendment. It also states: Dr. Fitzgerald and his party must vote against it in the light of his publicly declared concern to initiate Constitutional pre-conditions for a pluralist State for the whole of Ireland. It states at the end of this particular paragraph: His personal integrity and credibility must surely be in question. I regard that kind of publication as being devious, to use a polite word, because it is attempting to suggest that the attitude of pluralism as expressed by the Taoiseach last year cannot be accommodated by allowing him to support an amendment to the Constitution in isolation. That is now stated publicly by the Taoiseach and it is what I refer to when I say that he is now on the pluralist hook. However, I do not think that the bar of the hook is encased in the Taoiseach to such extent that he has not the capacity to disengage himself from it by saying simply that the proposed amendment does not offend pluralism. Surely, the concept of a pluralist society is not [1580] offended by the guaranteeing of what we regard as a fundamental right — the right to life. This brings me to the Taoiseach's role last year in all this business. It is important to put on record just a few instances of utterances from the Taoiseach concerning his position on the amendment as he saw it at that time. The first and most important letter from the Taoiseach that we must take careful note of is the one of 6 November 1982 when he wrote to the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign people and stated that it was as a result of a unanimous decision of Fine Gael that they were committed to introducing the amendment in Government and having it put to the people before 31 March. He went on to say that the referendum would not be delayed by any another consideration. That little snippet from the Taoiseach's letter is self-evident — that he was acting virtually on the instructions of a commitment that had been entered into on the basis of a unanimous decision of Fine Gael out of Government but which indicated clearly what their position would be in Government. On the 'Today Tonight' programme of 4 November last the Taoiseach said that before endorsing the wording of the Fianna Fáil proposal he had taken legal advice and that he thought the amendment was the best we could get. There is nothing ambiguous in that kind of wording. It states simply that the Taoiseach, before giving the commitment in writing of the unanimous decision of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party had taken legal advice on the wording that the Fianna Fáil Government had brought forward. The Taoiseach was still in a position to say then that the amendment was the best we could get and that Fine Gael were committing themselves totally to it. Therefore, we had not merely a promise but a solid commitment from the Taoiseach. Being the astute politician that he is in his own way, the Taoiseach does not make commitments lightly in any circumstance and certainly not in a matter of a constitutional amendment and in a matter of such enormous consequence. Consequently, we can assume that when the [1581] Taoiseach said he had taken legal advice, that advice was taken at the highest level. We might ask what legal advice did the Taoiseach seek at that time. It is hardly credible that Fine Gael as a party would not have sought the advice of their former legal adviser who is now their Attorney General and who had been their Attorney General also while they were in office on the previous occasion. I would find it hard to accept that Mr. Sunderland had no input into advising the Taoiseach on the wording of the amendment in November last particularly since the present Attorney General had been in office also when the matter was discussed by the previous Coalition. It would be normal to expect that the Leader of Fine Gael, after a considerable length of time, having got the wording that had been expected and that had been looked forward to by so many people, though obviously not by certain elements, would have made his arrangements well in advance to have the matter considered carefully by the best legal advice he could obtain. What better legal advice might the Taoiseach seek than the advice of a man to whom he had entrusted the responsibilities of Attorney General on a previous occasion and whom obviously he had in mind to put into office again in the event of a return to office of the Coalition? Because at that time in November, the Taoiseach was so able to give a quick response to the wording as outlined by Fianna Fáil, it seems to me that his arrangements were made in advance. It is interesting to pose the question of how many Deputies in Fine Gael are happy with the wording proposed. It is believed by some of us that the vast majority of those Deputies would have been happy with it just as the Taoiseach was happy up to recently about it. Might it be the far-leftish wing of Fine Gael who disagree? These are people who would be anti the amendment anyway. The services of a journalistic commentator or observer are not required for the purpose of pointing out to me who would form that hard leftish wing of the Fine Gael [1582] Party. They can be quite vociferous on occasions. They are playing a very significant role in trying to scuttle this amendment, despite the best efforts of the Taoiseach, as he has so often stated. If Mr. Sutherland has stated that he had not an opportunity of looking at the wording at that time, I find it difficult, the words having been printed in the public press, to believe that he would not have been very anxious to communicate his observations to his leader. However, it certainly does not excuse one other person from his involvement at that time and I refer to the intervention of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this matter at this time. That would be regarded as unusual, to put it mildly. He is a very talented, exceptional and competent person in his job, but it must be remembered that he was appointed as an independent civil servant. Good civil servants, especially those who have reached the higher echelons of the establishment, are not often expected to make public comments, especially about highly sensitive political matters which are, in actual fact, going to be decided upon by the population as a whole. It was with some regret that I noted the involvement of the DPP on this occasion. As I understand it, he brings prosecutions under existing statutes and certainly does not prosecute under the provisions of the Constitution, per se. That would be somewhat outside the ambit of his writ. The timing of his intervention suggests that he was prompted to intervene to influence the matter in a certain direction, which would certainly be unfortunate. I would have put much more credence on his intervention had it taken place — I personally believe it should not have taken place at all — at another time, in another place. The anti-amendment campaign, as it is working its way through the system, is no more and no less than — in fact, virtually the same as — the pro-abortion lobby. One can see that readily in the sponsoring bodies who include all the abortion-campaigning organisations as listed and registered in this country. It is an interesting small, but nevertheless [1583] significant point, that the Pro-life Amendment Campaign headquarters are openly listed as 21, Merrion Square. There is no difficulty at all about its being readily recognised as coming from a particular location in this city. It is not quite so easy, however, to know where the anti-amendment campaign has its headquarters, or the location from which it is operating. The quickest way one could establish that is by reference to this document to which I have referred and which is on the record in which it has itself listed under post office box 1285 in this city. While one would have to have a knowledge of the location of the post office boxes — and I certainly have not — it is suggested that the headquarters of the anti-amendment campaign are located in an establishment where abortion referrals are the order of the day. That campaign is being orchestrated from the premises well known to the Minister and others as being foremost in promoting abortion as an acceptable and fashionable means of dealing with unwanted pregnancies here. Can the Minister and the Government not see the strategy being employed by the anti-amendment campaigners? They want to divide the Government and it seems that they have succeeded somewhat there. They want to divide the Fine Gael Party and it would also seem that they have been reasonably successful in that area of activity, as well. They have certainly divided the Labour Party. This is all in the hope of confusing the electorate so that that electorate might tire of the efforts in support of having this amendment inserted into the Constitution. Their dearest wishes would be realised if, with that now obvious division in the various parties making up the Government, they had this enabling legislation dropped altogether, if a situation could be devised whereby a certain modus operandi of voting on this and perhaps other legislation which might come before us in the near future could bring about a situation where the legislation could be shelved for the foreseeable future. While I note the Minister of State wagging his head negatively, in a few minutes — if he stays here that long [1584]— I will be pointing out to the Minister for the record what some of his senior Ministers, or at least one, has to say about that very matter.;2060965

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;02.03.83;M;Mr. Frank Prendergast;The Labour Party;A Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom ar an gcéad dul síos a chur in iúl duit féin agus do mhuintir an Taoisigh go bhfuilim-se leis na daoine siúd atá ag moladh leasú ar an mBunreacht. Creidim go bhfuil géarghá le seo. Is trua nach bhfuilimid ag brath ar an bhfoclaíocht mar a bhíodh sé as Gaeilge mar tá seisean i bhfad níos soiléire as Gaeilge ná mar atá sé as Béarla. Tá focal ann sa Laidinis jus, the right as Béarla, agus níl aon fhocal in aon theanga an domhain go bhfuil aithne agamsa uirthi a thagann chomh gar don fhocal sin jus agus a thagann an focal 'ceart' as Gaeilge. 'Tá an ceart agam. It is my right.' In rising to support those people who wish to have the amendment to the Constitution I do so conscious of the fact that, following my own election campaign, I was subjected to a most unfair, unfounded, unwarranted, well-orchestrated campaign of vilification. I invited those people who commented adversely on our election campaign to conduct a public inquiry into the manner of that campaign. Nobody did so. Statements were made in several areas of the media which were utterly without foundation and I was offered the opportunity to explain our position only on John Bowman's programme 'Day By Day'. Unfortunately I could not avail of that opportunity because at the same time I [1607] was involved in a one-and-a-half hour programme on Radio na Gaeltachta. Some people in the press made statements which were downright untrue and when my director of elections supplied them with all the material they refused to publish it. I deliberately kept silent because I agree with the seanfhocal, binn béal ina thost. Some of the people who publicly made these comments came to me privately afterwards and admitted that they were wrong. At least they had the good grace to do so, but they did not make that admission publicly. Conscious of that, I will try to be as dispassionate as possible in my comments during this debate. I should like to address myself to some of the aspects of the argument against the need to amend the Constitution. There is a faulty argument put forward by those opposed to the referendum. The fundamental question under discussion, that of abortion, is not a religious or a political question but one of ethics and morals concerning ipso facto the type of society we wish to create for ourselves and to hand on to those who will come after us. Even if we were a uniformly denominational people, whether Catholic, Protestant, Christian, Jewish or Moslem, even if we were uniformly atheist, we would still have mixed views on social issues such as this. At present we have differing views within every denomination and within the medical and legal professions who will be most directly involved in this issue in their working lives. The fundamental issue is whether or not we are for or against abortion. We must allow for the sincerity of those who profess themselves opposed to abortion but equally opposed to the amendment. However, they are de facto giving refuge to those who are in favour of abortion and accuse the pro-life people of being devious. It is obvious from comments on both sides of the debate that the vast majority of the people in this country oppose abortion. Others would have it allowed in certain circumstances such as rape, incest or malformation of the foetus. I wonder on the latter reckoning whether Aesop would have got through, one of the finest [1608] minds ever. I understand that he was a dwarf and might not have qualified on the latter count. It is a matter of regret that this has been projected as a sectarian issue. I believe that view is misguided but it could be more sinister. There could be uisce faoi thalamh. Last week I read a letter in The Irish Independent from a lady who described herself as the secretary of the life movement in England. She said a deliberate decision had been taken by the pro-abortion people there to have the debate here on a sectarian level on the grounds that we would be most sensitive to that type of allegation. Hugh Leonard said — and I think he is right — that nobody in Ireland will ever die of a swelled head. That is certainly true of us as a people. We give first place to no other nation in highlighting our shortcomings. God knows we have plenty of critics, and I suppose that is not without reason, but I believe not even our most trenchant critics could honestly describe us as a sectarian people. In 1972 I was one of 720,000 people who voted in a referendum on the basis of five to one to delete from the Constitution the special position accorded to the Catholic Church to which the vast majority of people here belong. In any objective analysis of us as a people that should be remembered. I reject any suggestion that we are a sectarian people. It was the people who made that change in the Constitution and I believe they were correct. It is important to remember that it was not the legislators who made the change. There is bound to be a polarisation of views on this issue, as in the case of the vast majority of democratic issues. It is the very essence of the democratic principle that there is a majority and a minority. It is the glory and weakness of the democratic system. There is what we call the tyranny of democracy. In eighteenth century France the opponents of the political philosophy of democracy used the academic argument that if the majority said something it could be true on a democratic basis but factually incorrect. If 30 Members here were asked to add two and two and 20 of us said five and the other ten said four, democratically 20 [1609] Members would be correct but mathematically they would be wrong. The majority could say that today was Friday, 9 August again that would be democratically true but factually wrong. The tradition in the social democracies has been that by and large, with some dishonourable exceptions, the majority have acted in fairness and in deference to the wishes of the political minority. This is true in most Western democracies but sometimes the minority deliberately use the taunt of oppression, bigotry or sectarianism. It has to be remembered that if the majority are favourable, well-disposed and sensitive to the views of the minority that is done by generous consensus. If a minority deliberately try to project a situation — it would be a legitimate democratic position on a democratic vote — as sectarian that could unfairly reflect on the authors of that taunt because that type of thing can often be a reflex of the inverse. You can have bigotry from some of the authors in a minority situation the same as you can have inverted snobbery. I am not saying that anybody who opposes the amendment is a bigot I am only saying that it could be construed unintentionally that this is what they are trying to do. I believe there is another type of false argument which came from some members of my party. I am speaking here from my own deeply held conscientious views on this issue. I know I reflect the viewpoint of the vast majority of the people who sent me here when I say that I support the principles enshrined in the amendment campaign. I have no connection with any group on either side of this issue. I have formed my opinions from having read and listened to the debate. It has been said that there has been faulty argumentation but there is a certain amount of what I would call sophistry as well. I know that people are sincere when they say that if this referendum is passed it will not change the number of abortions taking place at the moment. I accept that fully and completely. I believe, regrettably, that that is true. But those things are not contingent one upon the other. To [1610] say that that is the reason why we should not hold the referendum is sophistry. At its best it is naive and at its worst it is disingenuous because it is the type of argument which says that a horse has four legs, a table has four legs, therefore the table is a horse. It is trying to convolute two independent truths that have nothing to do with each other. Somebody on one side of the divide said if you buy an egg timer you do not expect the BBC home service from the egg timer. The two things are quite separate. I wish to endorse the sentiments of Deputy Tom O'Donnell and others that we should be doing everything in our power to help the people who get themselves into a lonely and unfortunate situation because of some of the attitudes we have here. I would like to give another example. Somebody may say that London is the capital of England or that today is 2 March. Both things are equally true but it does not affect the actual position that there is a fundamental need to ensure that there is no loophole in our laws which would permit the introduction of abortion. With regard to the second part of the premise that we should be seeking to create a society where conditions are such that abortion would not be necessary, while I subscribe absolutely and unequivocally to this principle — I do not know anybody who would not subscribe to it — I would not accept it as a device for delaying the referendum. Where has there ever been in the world a State or society that would be so perfect in the eyes of the promoters of that line of argument that somebody would not want to have an abortion? When we are going into the future where social need, social want and deprivation will, we hope, be things of the past I believe there will still be people who will want to have abortions for no other reason than the inconvenience, however justified it may be, of having children. I doubt if we will ever reach the level of civilisation where somebody will not be looking for an abortion. I would welcome the situation where nobody would seek an abortion but I do not honestly believe I will see it in my lifetime. When I was in Moscow two years ago [1611] the figures there for abortion were among the highest in the world. The same is true of the State of California. Those are two different types of society which are totally opposite in their political, social and religious viewpoints. I believe that for anybody to argue that we should be more concerned with bringing about the state of society which would not require an abortion rather than have a referendum is sophistry of the worst kind, naive at its best and dishonest at its worst. I do not want to accuse anybody of being dishonest. I believe in all social issues we should establish the hierarchy of values. If I might use an industrial analogy, I believe it is socially wrong where some people are holding down two or three jobs which could be done by others who have not a job and who need a job, or people working excessive overtime which could be shared with no great loss with others who have not any job at all. Surely the first right in that context is the right of every person to have a job. That is one social issue. In the context of this debate on abortion surely the most fundamental and inalienable of all human rights is the right to be born. It is a pity we could not confine ourselves to the wording in Irish put forward by the previous Government because Irish being a more juridical language and more precise in its meaning than English spells out clearly the right of the unborn to be born. The Latin word jus is the basis of everything to do with justice, the Judiciary and everything to do with the law and I am told by linguists that there is no other word in any language so near or so precise in meaning as the word ceart in Irish. Tá an ceart agam, I have the right. I believe that the most transcendental right of all other rights — all other rights follow this one and do not come into being if this one does not — is the right to be born. It must always be the great transcendental for all civilisation. That nation can only be called great which opens its doors to all mankind. I believe that to deny the right of life today is to vindicate Hitler's policy of selective breeding. I believe those things need to be said. [1612] Another area in which I consider there is faulty argument on the part of those who oppose the referendum is the question of the cost involved. Like the toad with the jewel in its head, democracy has its weaknesses but as a reflection of the principle of government of the people, by the people and for the people it is the greatest political system ever devised by human society. The referendum is the highest expression of the principle of democracy. The Swiss have shown the way in that regard. We do not have enough referenda. To speak about the cost of the referendum is to gratuitously insult those of us who argue in favour of the need to amend the Constitution. Some months ago I read in the columns of The Irish Times that a son of the horse Nijinsky had been sold for £2 million. That represents two-and-a-half times the cost of the referendum we are talking of and we are now watching the farce, or at least it would be a farce if it were not so serious, whereby the syndicate who own Shergar are claiming £20 million from the Irish people for the abduction of that animal. I doubt if even the most vociferous of those who oppose the holding of the referendum would suggest that all the Shergars that might ever be born would be more valuable than the life of one child. I suggest that not even £10 million would be too much to pay to save the life of someone whose life was in danger by, perhaps, being trapped down a mountain in Wicklow or halfway down the face of the Cliffs of Mother. As to the wording of the amendment, my main concern is that any present difficulty would not be used deliberately to have the amendment delayed or postponed though from the point of view of debate of the issues involved, I do not mind how long it takes because the proposal has done a good deal to make people aware of the issues involved. I read recently that an American, a distinguished member of the medical profession, spoke here and said that he had been part of the campaign for the introduction of abortion in America. He said that the people involved in that campaign had set out deliberately to address themselves to the intellectuals and to the media in [1613] America and that they set out also to project as being backward anyone who opposed abortion. This is the usual sort of contempt that is invoked whenever we want to dismiss someone as being reactionary or fascist merely because he is traditional in his sense of values. I gather that in America 99 per cent of the people were against abortion but because the decision to provide for abortion was a judicial one, the views of that 99 per cent of people were flouted. That danger is here, too. We are relying on the Offences against the Person Act, but that would not be sufficient to protect the life of the unborn in the face of a judicial decision on the lines of that taken in the US. That Act, which was introduced here by a Protestant Ascendancy, was never questioned on the grounds of being sectarian. It reflected the sentiments of the legislature in England, while the appropriate Act in America reflected the sentiments of the legislature of that country. But that was the Act that was deemed by members of the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, a decision which resulted in opening the floodgates for abortion despite the manifest opposition in principle and in conscience of the vast majority of the American people. It has been said that the devil can cite scripture to suit his purpose. Wolfe Tone is often cited in his very laudable dictum of replacing the words, 'Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter' with the common name of Irishmen. I am confident that what Tone had in mind was that those three words should be divested of their pejorative content, of their divisive nature. I do not think he was talking about a purely secular society because above all else, and regardless of whether we be Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or of any other faith, we are by nature a people who believe in a hereafter. We are largely of the Judeo-Christian ethic which believes in a life hereafter. Tone also was the one who said that the only people he could rely on were people of no property. I suggest that it was precisely because they had no property that he could rely on them. I was somewhat disturbed to hear some people say that if the amendment were to [1614] be accepted it would have the unfortunate effect of creating artificial barriers between ourselves and the people in Northern Ireland. Anyone who knows me is well aware of my views in regard to Northern Ireland. I am trenchantly opposed to any suggestion of coercing anyone on this island into becoming part of our system against his wishes. I have been the subject of threats as a result of making known my position on that matter. But I regarded it as the ultimate in cynicism when some of those who promoted that line of argument at certain fora at which I was present were the very people who only last year were passing votes of sympathy with people in the North who were murdering and shooting the very people whose sensitivities these other people are anxious to protect in this situation. I have no wish to adopt an argumentative or pejorative stance on this issue. I wish only to be as fair and objective as possible. But, as George Bernard Shaw admonished, we should always emphasise the positive. We should have regard to our heritage. Within the context of democracy it may very well be that in time our successors will decide we were wrong. Being facetious for the moment, if I may, I do not know how true it is but I am told — and am open to correction on this — that a council of the Church decided by a majority of two votes that women had souls. If true, it was a good job that three of them had not gone to the toilet when the vote was taken or we might find ourselves in a very difficult situation. We should positively enshrine within our Constitution the protection of the unborn. It should be taken out of the hands of the theologians and the lawyers — two categories which have been notably fallible in the past. We should allow the people to make the decision. Nobody should be afraid of the decision of the people. That is the only way forward on this issue. I cannot understand the argument of those who proclaim themselves democratics, and indeed socialists, and at the same time seek to prevent or upstage the holding of a referendum. Whatever form of words is put to the people they [1615] should copperfasten the principle that because abortion is intrinsically evil it should not be legally possible within the jurisdiction of this State to introduce something intrinsically evil and manifestly against the wishes of the people. It is interesting that nearly everybody on both sides of this argument who has spoken on this issue has prefaced his or her remarks by saying 'I am against abortion'. Then they continue to say whether they are for or against the referendum. Sin atá le rá agam. Ba mhaith liom cuidiú arís leis an meon atá taobh thiar den leasú seo.

170;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;02.03.83;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Trying to sidetrack me in that way will come to the same bad result as has come to anybody else on that side, whoever tried it. It is significant that the splits in this divided Coalition were evident long before the Minister, Deputy Noonan, made his confusing Second Stage speech in the House. It is obvious there are people who do not wish Deputy FitzGerald to honour the commitment solemnly given to the pro-life amendment campaign in the letter of November last and subsequently reiterated by him in public on more than one occasion. It has been suggested that the wording in the Bill is ambiguous and unsatisfactory. I am sure that the suggestion that it is unsatisfactory is the personal view of the man who made it. It certainly does not represent the majority view in this House or of the electorate. The question of ambiguity is an entirely different matter. Although I will not deal with it at any [1589] great length, I will make some reference to it. In recent reports there has been reference to the word 'unborn' in the recommended version. It has been said it is not totally satisfactory. To my mind the interpretation of that word does not depend on any scientific or theological considerations. Everyone will accept that it is primarily a matter of usage of words in legal terms as we know them. It is very much in line with the way the words 'infirm' and 'aged' are used in Articles 40 and 45 of the Constitution. 'Unborn' must be interpreted in the same way as 'unborn child' or 'unborn children'. It is a matter of usage. It is used here as a noun and I say it would have the same stance in legal terms as 'infirm' and 'aged' in later Articles of the Constitution. I cannot see the difficulty. People might suggest that there is, but to my mind we can accept that 'unborn' can only refer to 'unborn child'. It is a noun and I cannot see it being elaborated on further.;2060971

174;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;02.03.83;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;It is used as a noun here and it would be used as other words are used in other Articles of the Constitution. The use of the word as we had it is accepted by the vast majority of Deputies on all sides. It is well accepted scientifically that the fertilised ovum has all the genetics of human life and therefore it must be a human being and, as any human being, it must be entitled to the protection of law. That is what the amendment would seek to achieve. I cannot see any difficulty or ambiguity, although people have been trying to suggest such for the purpose of delaying or to further the confusion that I am afraid the Government will have to take some [1590] responsibility for, although others, too, have played an important role. The Government have the major responsibility in this matter. They had months to consider this business and could have taken a different attitude than merely asking us to approve something in principle on the appropriate day. Existing law on abortion, and this includes the law as it would have been promulgated in Britain and in the US, is clearly understood as being applicable from the time of fertilisation. That has been understood clearly in many judgments handed down in those jurisdictions. It is clearly understood in all their laws concerning abortion that it is from the time of fertilisation, so I do not see any conflict there. There cannot be ambiguity. The right to life of the unborn clearly recognises the right to life at all stages of development once you establish that that is the time involved, which has been clearly established in other jurisdictions. That being the case, the need for protection at all stages of development is recognised. I do not think there can be any ambiguity there. On the question of the equal right to life of the mother, it is guaranteed that you cannot kill the mother to save the child, or kill the child to save the mother in the case of a conflict. Both lives must be equally protected. It is very important to have that absolutely clear in everybody's mind. There is no criminality in the termination of a pregnancy which is the incidental and unintended consequence of the removal, say, of a cancerous womb in order to preserve the mother's life, since nothing would have been done with intent to procure a miscarriage. It is very important that we should understand that as well. There is a lot of loose talk about what might or might not be the situation. It should be understood by all and sundry that, under this amendment when it is incorporated in the Constitution, no woman will be denied medical or surgical treatment because she is pregnant. Those are the types of scare stories which are put around to lead astray even those who are favourably disposed to the amendment. That is not intended. [1591] We all know it is quite acceptable to perform a hysterectomy to save the life of a pregnant women with a cancerous womb, for example. The removal of an abnormal tube is also acceptable. This is known as an ectopic pregnancy. There is also some question about radiation treatment. It is clearly stated, even by those who support the existing legislation on abortion, that this is not an abortion in medical or legal terms. This must be clearly understood. It is the unsought result of necessary and appropriate treatment. That cannot and will not be denied to a female in the circumstances I have stated. These are quite legitimate medical procedures. When you hear people talk about them you ask the respective disciplines what number of cases can be counted in these areas. Then you realise how rare they are. It almost makes medical history now when some of these things take place. These operations are legal and in no way interfere with the right of the pregnant woman to have the surgical or radiation treatment necessary to protect her life. To suggest that this is sectarianism or that the proposal might be regarded as sectarian is blatantly dishonest. It is blatantly dishonest for those who are against this amendment to seek to cause confusion by accusing people of sectarianism if they hold a particular point of view. Why should it matter if the vast majority of the people support a point of view and that point of view happens to coincide with the teaching of the majority Church? Are we being eased into a situation in which it is wrong to support the basic beliefs of the majority religion in case it offends some tiny group of vocal concept pushers as they are now appearing in this land? Must the vast silent majority of people be denied the right to say what they believe in? That is the essence of this legislation: to allow the people to voice their opinions. Why should we be ashamed? Why should anybody be ashamed that public opinion should reflect the religious views of the vast majority of the population? We must not soft pedal on our principles for the sake of popularity in the short-term, [1592] or so-called sophistication, or worse still, for harmony's sake, in the hope that this will somehow enhance the universal view taken of us as a people. I do not see it in that way at all. The greatest gesture we can make to other groups, both close by and far away, is to show the depths of our beliefs and standards, and our determination as a people to display them as the hallmark of our society. That is what the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign is all about. I do not know who is gagging certain people, as suggested, in fact, gagging the Taoiseach. What is the reason for the deafening silence on the part of certain groups on the Government benches? Why is the Taoiseach playing this low profile role in all this business of late? Today in his first intervention he suggested to us and to the nation that a set of words will be suggested to us in about two weeks, I presume by way of an amendment. I found that an extraordinary strange statement for the Taoiseach to make. Either he has the words now, or he has not. How can he say he will have them in two weeks, or two days, or two months? Is he telling us he has the words today, but he has to circulate them among people, or friends, or groups, or organisations, to see if they find favour with them, and when they come back, perhaps inside two weeks, they can be promoted here? Is he suggesting that, if he has a set of words which find favour with them, having put them out for circulation they may be on their way back in a couple of weeks, unaltered and acceptable to all the people he would like to please, he will then introduce them here? He does not give us any detail. He just mentions two weeks, or about two weeks. I have not got the exact wording. That seems very strange to me. If he had said: 'We are working on it new wording will be put forward we hope we can get everybody to agree this will happen soon', I would accept that and leave it at that. To say that in two weeks a set of words will be put forward in the House by way of amendment or otherwise is asking us to accept too much. If he is as [1593] sure as that today, he has the wording today. Why not circulate it to us if that is the case? I am sorry somebody did not question him on whether the Cabinet had discussed the remarks he made today. It would be interesting to know that. Is it a fact that he has in his own mind the words he intends to offer to the Irish people by way of alternative to the wording we believe is acceptable across the board, and some time inside the next two weeks he will float them to the Cabinet and ask for their support? It was a strange intervention to say the least. It did not suggest to me anything other than muddled thinking, further adding to the confusion for which the Government will have to accept some responsibility. With regard to the intervention today, is the Taoiseach trying to protect the Labour partners in Government or is he trying to prevent a sizeable number of his own front and backbenchers from deserting his commitment? Are the Labour Party putting the Government on notice that they do not want the wording changed for fear of being caught offside? I would not like to speculate about that but I am quite sure there will be a lot of speculation about what is happening in the corridors of power. The Labour Party said they wanted a free vote. That was before they went into Government but if a new wording is decided upon by the Government then the Labour Party will be part of that decision. They were not party to the decision taken by us collectively when we decided on the wording last year. If, as the Taoiseach has suggested today, a new wording might be forthcoming within two weeks, it would have to be cleared by the Government, and the Labour Party element in that Government would have to be part of that decision. How then can they opt out of supporting something collectively framed by them? How can that thinking be reconciled with a statement publicly made by at least one, if not more, of the members serving in that Government that he would not support any amendment? That is some dilemma for the Labour Party, although I am not too concerned [1594] about that. They would have been better advised to have taken the option put to them and which had the support of the vast majority both inside and outside the House, namely, the wording we put forward. Instead, they created difficulties for themselves. I am not so sure the Labour Party want a change. While there is no change in the wording they can shirk their responsibility. They can always say they did not promise their support for that wording. However, if there is new wording they will have been part of the decision to bring it before the House. It is well known politically that when a Cabinet Minister cannot or will not accept responsibility for a decision collectively taken he has no place at the table where decisions are taken. The constitutional amendment is very important and it demands a better response than the washing of hands posturing we have had from certain elements of the Government. I ask the Labour Party to stop their political gymnastics, to stop hiding behind the pseudo legalistic arguments they have put forward. It simply means that there is a pro-abortion pressure building up somewhere in their system which is exercising undue influence. Certainly it is flying in the face of the vast majority of opinion in the country. The credibility of the Government has been badly dented by their handling of this legislation. If there is any redemption to be found for them it lies only in their honouring the commitment solemnly given by their leader. They must allow the electorate the democratic right to express their view and to cease further confusing the people by bringing in alternatives that are not necessary.

176;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;02.03.83;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;However, in seeking so to confuse the electorate that they would tire of it or that it would no longer be possible to promote the legislation properly here, they have it wrong. It is only steeling the minds of the amendment campaigners. They are not going to allow themselves to be sidetracked in any way from having recorded what they wish to have recorded in the amendment, as far as the Constitution is concerned. Another piece of propaganda is going about on behalf of the anti-amendment people and it is as well to nail this down, too. One must remember that any future Supreme Court, no matter how liberal some of its judges might be, will have to recognise, once this amendment becomes part of the Constitution, that the result was brought about by a single-minded decision of the Irish people as a whole. They will have no difficulty whatsoever in interpreting that wish. It will act as a magnificent, massive deterrent to passing down a decision that they will know, by referendum result, does not reflect the minds and the wishes of the majority of our people. It will not be possible then to read abortion into the Constitution, as might be done now, if a certain set of circumstances and positions could be brought about. There will be no induced abortion in this country once this matter is decided irrespective of the political circumstances that might exist at any given time or the pressures that might be brought about either inside or outside this House. That surely will accommodate the vast majority of our people in effect that is what the amendment seeks to do. One must remember that certain individuals, or even certain groups, have been suggesting — and they put it honestly to the electorate at this time — that abortion could never happen here. They say it can never happen here legally. I [1585] regard that as a device on the part of certain individuals perhaps to comfort some small number of constituents but certainly it is not in accordance with the facts. It is an interesting exercise to look at some of the statistics, both here and worldwide in so far as that particular device is concerned — trying to suggest that it can never happen here. We must remember that 75 per cent of the population of this world now lives legally under abortion laws. We have only to see the progression over the years during which it has been regularised in so many different countries, not just in England in 1967, the USA in 1973, France in 1975, Germany in 1976, Italy in 1978 and Holland in 1981 but there are many other countries as well. It is interesting that the cry in each one of those countries I have mentioned was that abortion would never be available on demand in any circumstances. That historical fact is there to disprove that claim, just as it is being stated here now, that it will never happen legally here. Experience has shown that it has happened in other places in the self same way. One must remember especially the way it was brought about in America, by a Supreme Court ruling there. Now the USA are fighting to have a pro-life amendment inserted in their Constitution, abortion having been imposed on them by a Supreme Court ruling. They are finding it extraordinarily difficult to have such an amendment inserted in their Constitution despite the support of many people right at the very top in America in favour of abortion. It was stated that it would never happen there. It did and it is so infinitely more difficult to alter it when it has become legalised than to take the step we are asking be taken now. I want to pose the question: is it wrong for us to be out of step on this issue and give testimony to the value we place on human life in our society? While most of the world now labours and lives under abortion laws it is a fairly frightening statistic — and the source is the United States Statistics Office — that there are [1586] 55 million unborn killed by surgical operation every year in this world now. I had to check that figure twice to ensure that it was correct. That amounts to 150,000 per day. I am not at all unmindful of the number of abortions that have been performed because of referrals from this country since abortion became legalised in Britain in 1967. I understand the figure is approximately 35,000. I do not know what great pressures were placed on those unfortunates who felt that that constituted the solution to their problem. Certainly I would have been much happier had those 35,000 Irish souls been added to our total population at this time irrespective of how difficult our economic situation may be. I daresay that had a lot of the people who begot those children had the right support, the right kind of help to enable them to allow those lives come into being and remain alive, they would now form part of our present population. The Government must now accept a certain amount of responsibility for what amounts to bungling in the handling of this legislation. No really clear view has been expressed by the present Government of their position. It was disappointing that the Minister for Justice, on the Second Reading, told us that he approved of the wording in principle but not in detail. It is difficult to understand what was the rush in his coming in if he was not satisfied with the wording as outlined by the previous Government in this regard. It is also difficult to understand — having spent two months in office, considering the position, knowing that they had to live up to the solemn commitment of the Taoiseach — why they could not have decided whether they were for or against the wording. To suggest that they agreed in principle was misleading. Certainly it does nothing for the credibility of the Government that they would promote such a misleading kind of Second Stage speech. That episode in the House on the part of the Minister for Justice was compounded very shortly afterwards by the Taoiseach, and the chaos widened further in so far as there was talk then of postponement of the whole business, talk that there [1587] might be word changes, as was reported from the Taoiseach's references to this in Galway in the recent past. The one thing we did not want to happen was that this whole question might degenerate into a political battle. That view has been expressed by my Leader on more than one occasion. The Government of the day will have to take some responsibility now for the confusion surrounding this whole business. In that regard, to fulfil my promise to the Minister of State — and I see he is getting edgy — I must refer to a statement issued by a former Minister for Justice, now Deputy Jim Mitchell. I refer to The Irish Times of Monday, 18 October 1982, with the heading 'Abortion Issue Enlivens A Cautious Fine Gael Ard Fheis'. The correspondent is well known and the accuracy of his reporting is beyond doubt. The report states:— Fine Gael's Spokesman on Justice, Mr. James Mitchell, made it clear that the Party now favours delaying any referendum for another year at least, or until a set of Constitutional changes can be put to the electorate. Therefore, it is not true to say that there is this degree of unanimity in the higher echelons of Fine Gael, even at that time last October. The report continues — it is still quoting Deputy Mitchell:— There should be no rushing and there must be no sectarianism and there must be no fanaticism. There must be calm and collective consideration of all the complexities involved. If that was not putting it up to his leader on that occasion to step back I do not know what it was. But undaunted, the present Taoiseach was unremitting in his decision and he subsequently wrote the letter I referred to earlier. It was clear from the discussion that Sunday in October last year that at least one of the front bench members of the present Government did not want this amendment put at that time in isolation. The next paragraph in The Irish Times report, which is quite casual, is interesting:— [1588] Dr. FitzGerald was clearly embarrassed by the passion of some of the speakers—— this part of it is relevant:—— — and by the attempts of the more vociferous supporters of the anti-abortion amendment to identify him personally with their campaign. Subsequently, the famous letter was written by Deputy FitzGerald saying that there was unanimous support by the Fine Gael Party.;2060977
177;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Willie O'Dea;Fianna Fáil;I listened with some interest to the references by the Minister of State to some of our prevailing social ills. One could be forgiven for forgetting that the Minister of State is a member of a party who are keeping this Government in power. If his party are to continue to keep this Government in power, why do they not insist on the Government tackling these prevailing social ills? I appreciate what the Minister of State said about the time taken resolving this problem, but I point out to him that it is within the power of the Government to put a number of constitutional amendments together to the people by way of referendum, if that is their choice. [2003] Sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, make abortion a criminal offence in effect. That law was passed by a British Parliament but it was carried over into the laws of the Irish State under the provisions of the Act of Union, 1800. The Constitution of 1922 carried over all previous British laws applicable to Ireland into the laws of the Irish Free State in so far as they were not inconsistent with that Constitution. The Constitution of 1922 was replaced by the Constitution of 1937 and the same position prevailed. In other words, all pre-1922 British laws were carried over into the laws of the Irish State post-1937 in so far as they were not inconsistent with the 1937 Constitution. The question of inconsistency with the 1937 Irish Constitution could be determined only if a citizen of the State challenged one of those laws as being inconsistent with that Constitution. Nobody has as yet challenged the validity of sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and accordingly, they are still applicable in Ireland. As I said at the outset, they make abortion a criminal offence and they provide extremely severe penalities for people who have been involved directly or indirectly in carrying out an abortion. At present, this law which makes abortion a criminal offence can be said to give an unborn person a right to life. This is done indirectly by making it a criminal offence for anybody to take the life or to participate in the taking of the life of a person who is conceived but as yet unborn. This right which the unborn has been given under sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, can be abolished or repealed in two ways. Firstly, it can be abolished by the Legislature. Both Houses of the Oireachtas can by a simple majority pass a law which would repeal sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. Alternatively any citizen of this State can challenge sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, on the grounds that they are unconstitutional, in some way inconsistent with the provisions of the 1937 Constitution. [2004] If the High Court and, of course, on appeal the Supreme Court, found these sections of the 1861 Act to be unconstitutional, then they would automatically cease to operate and abortion would no longer be a criminal offence in this State. Accordingly, the unborn's indirect right to life given by sections 57 and 58 of the 1861 Act would disappear. However, if the right to life of a person who has been conceived but is as yet unborn were contained in the Constitution, written into the Constitution, then it would require a referendum, that is a plebiscite, in which all citizens over the age of 18 would be entitled to vote to abolish that right. This is precisely what this amendment seeks to achieve. It seeks to incorporate the unborn person's right to life into the Constitution so that that right cannot be abolished, abrogated or changed without direct reference to the people. It takes the decision whether or not to interfere with the unborn person's right to life away from the courts and the Legislature and gives it directly to the people. On the general level two arguments have been advanced against this proposed change. Firstly, it is said that it will achieve nothing in the sense that it will not prevent one Irishwoman from going abroad to obtain an abortion. Secondly, it is said to be sectarian or divisive. I want to advert very briefly to each argument in turn. On the question of preventing Irishwomen from going abroad to obtain abortions, I have heard statements at pro-life meetings that this amendment will in some magic way prevent Irishwomen from going abroad to obtain abortions. That is nonsense. We all know that the amendment will not prevent one woman from leaving Ireland to obtain an abortion abroad. However, I would point out to the people who make that argument that at no time in the history of the world has one form of activity been universally banned in every country. That is still the situation and will continue to be the situation. Many activities are prohibited by the criminal laws of Ireland but are nevertheless legally permissible in other countries. No one has ever suggested, nor would it be correct to suggest, [2005] that we should try to prevent Irish people from going to countries where those activities are legally permissible and engaging in such activities. Irish people are free to do that and there is nothing we can do about it. The only way effectively to prohibit women and girls going abroad to obtain abortions is by a process of education on the evils and ill-effects of abortion. The fact that the proposed amendment would not prevent even one person going abroad to obtain an abortion is totally irrelevant to the issue before us. What is important is that the laws and Constitution of Ireland should reflect the ideals, aspirations and beliefs of the vast majority of the population of this State. This amendment would prevent abortion ever being legalised in this country, except by direct wish of the people expressed by way of referendum. That itself is a desirable and worthy objective. It is said that the Supreme Court interpret the laws in accordance with changing social conditions. I do not know if it is any part of the Supreme Court's mandate to do so, but I am ready to admit that the Supreme Court have certainly taken into account changed social conditions and attitudes when called upon to make a decision on whether legislation is constitutionally permissible. This applies particularly in relation to policy decisions, and a decision on sections 57 and 58 of the 1861 Act would come into this category. It would be logical to assume that the Supreme Court would not find sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, to be unconstitutional unless they felt that at least a substantial minority or perhaps to accept the decriminalisation of abortion. It puzzles me, however, that some people advance the argument that the interpretation of the will of the majority should be left in this case to the personal decision of five Supreme Court judges. It is a matter so fundamental that people are entitled to be consulted directly. There are other protections in the Constitution, the importance of which I do not wish to minimise. I speak of such rights as the right to private property [2006] contained in Article 43, the right to the inviolability of one's dwelling, the right to habeus corpus. These rights are extremely important and cannot be abrogated or changed without direct reference to the people. Surely the right to life is a more fundamental right. Why should it be possible to abolish this right to life without direct reference to the people when those lesser rights cannot be abolished except by this process? A second argument against the amendment is that it is in some way sectarian or divisive. I have attended meetings in my constituency held both by those who support the amendment and those who oppose it and I have not heard anyone spelling out precisely what 'sectarian' means in this context. My interpretation of speeches by the anti-amendment campaigners is that they claim this amendment would widen the gulf between the majority population in the South and the majority in Northern Ireland and thus further postpone the day of Irish unity by consent. If this is a proper interpretation of their argument, it is strange in the extreme, particularly since nobody has ever suggested that sections 57 and 58 of the 1861 Act are divisive or sectarian. I cannot see why a change in the method by which sections 57 and 58 can be repealed should postpone for one moment the day of Irish unity by consent. Are the anti-amendment campaigners really saying that the repeal of those provisions and the effective legislation of abortion will be part of the price which this country will have to pay for unity? If that is their argument, it is a price I am not prepared to pay, regardless of when it has to be paid and regardless of the complexion of the Government who seek to introduce it. I am sorry if I am misinterpreting the views of the anti-amendment campaigners but that argument seems to be implicit in their assertion that the proposed amendment is divisive or sectarian. I refer now to a point of view which was expressed a number of years ago but is heard less often today, possibly because of the economic problem. There is a view that the way to achieve Irish unity by consent is to lower our standards, [2007] change our laws and do whatever the other side want. That sort of approach will never win the minds and hearts of the Northern Unionists. The inescapable reality is that the respect others have for us is directly proportionate to the respect we have for ourselves. Because of internal conflicts in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, as well as conflict between the two parties, the Government have sought to backtrack from the implementation of this amendment. They have adopted a misleading approach in order to find a way out, but it is also a dangerous approach. The argument being used is that the wording is vague and imprecise and could lead to some unexpected results. There has never been and never will be any written law or constitutional provision that when closely and expertly examined could not be said to lead to some unexpected or unforeseen results. A few leading lawyers will always produce some section or wording which will produce unforeseen results. If we were to carry that argument to its logical conclusion it would lead to some absurd results. It would make this House and the other House redundant as far as our function as lawmakers is concerned. We could not embark on any more legislation except, perhaps, in the simplest form. The courts could no longer make decisions which would in effect constitute rules of law. This would lead to the abandonment of the Constitution because I am sure that any reasonably skilled lawyer could do with any Article of the Constitution what the Attorney General has done with this amendment. A reasonably instructed lawyer could examine any Article and find some word or phrase which, if interpreted in a certain way in a certain context, would give rise to a result which at present seems undesirable. I find somewhat peculiar the Attorney General's reasoning for urging caution in relation to this amendment. The central argument is that the word 'unborn' is not defined. Consequently the courts could take the view that the person who is protected by the amendment is only a person who is capable of being born. I [2008] am not a medical expert but the medical evidence is that the foetus does not become capable of being born alive until after 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. That would be a very peculiar interpretation of this amendment if the Supreme Court were ever to take that particular interpretation. The peculiarity of that possible future ruling by the Supreme Court can be seen when we look at what, in effect, the law would be if the Supreme Court interpreted the amendment in that way. The result of that interpretation would be that for the first 28 weeks of pregnancy the unborn child would be protected by sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. That legislation, so far as it related to the first 28 weeks of pregnancy, could still be changed by legislation and the Government would not have to go to the people by way of a referendum to bring about that change. However, so far as sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 applied to the foetus after 28 weeks of pregnancy the abolition of those sections or any change in them would have to be referred to the people by way of a referendum. That would be a highly illogical and unreal situation. I am sure that no properly instructed Supreme Court could interpret this amendment in such a way as to give rise to such a misleading, illogical and unreal situation. Even if it did the position would then be that the unborn child is still protected in the same way as it is protected now up to the end of the 28th week of pregnancy and it would be protected by the law, copperfastened by the Constitution, after the 28th week of pregnancy. The protection of the child who is conceived but is as yet unborn is somewhat strengthened. It is in no way weakened and, consequently, I cannot understand the Attorney General's argument in this context. He has also argued that the words 'with due regard to the equal right of the mother' in the amendment can give rise to a situation — we are talking about very exceptional circumstances — where a doctor would not be permitted to intervene to save either the life of the mother or the life of the child in a situation where it had to be one or [2009] the other. That situation is governed by medical ethics and medical ethics are part of the natural law. The Attorney General, Mr. Sutherland, should know better than anybody else in the House that the natural law is superior and antecedent to all positive law. Consequently, no problem arises here. Deputy Shatter made a few interesting remarks in the course of his contribution which I read carefully. He said that the word 'unborn' was wide enough to cover children who had not yet been conceived. Accordingly, if the amendment not only protects the right to be born after being conceived but in fact protects the right to be born and that right includes the right to be conceived, then the right to the availability of contraceptives, which was established by the Supreme Court in the McGee case and incorporated into legislation in 1979, could be challenged. That was Deputy Shatter's viewpoint. One could ask oneself if this is really a realistic argument. It seems to me there are two fundamental objections to it. The McGee case decided that the right to the availability of contraceptives was implicit in the Constitution as it stands. It is not a right expressed in any Article but it is a right implicit in the Constitution as it stands. We must ask ourselves would the Supreme Court be inclined to interpret a subsequent amendment to the Constitution as being directly contrary to a right, which the same Supreme Court had found to be clearly implicit in the Constitution as it was before the amendment? As Deputy Shatter pointed out, there are a number of possible logical interpretations of the word 'unborn'. Consequently I cannot see why the Supreme Court would take the one interpretation which would directly conflict with the right which it had already found to be implicitly in the Constitution. The second objection I would have to Deputy Shatter's argument is from a reading of the amendment as a whole. The amendment refers to the equal right of the mother of the unborn. Consequently the unborn person, who is being protected by the Constitution, is envisaged to have a mother. Can it be said [2010] realistically that a person who is not yet even conceived has a mother? I suppose it may be a possible interpretation but it is one which is highly unlikely to be taken. Deputy Shatter said also that since the Constitution has been found to be a vibrant, living, legal document many rights have been found to be implicit in the Constitution, which were not foreseen at the time it was drafted. He stated that many such rights may also be found to be implicit in this amendment, which were not foreseen at the moment when it was being drafted. The Minister of State had a rather similar argument when he referred to a Pandora's Box which could be opened at some time in the future and at this point in time nobody knew what would be contained in it. That argument is nonsensical. Since the Constitution is a vibrant, living, legal document many rights which were not expressly stated have been found to be implicit in it. I am sure that many others will be found to be implicit in it as social conditions and economic conditions change. If Deputy Shatter's argument is taken as a reason for rejecting this amendment then, in effect, we should abandon the entire Constitution now because many things may be found in the future to be implicit in the Constitution as it now stands which are not foreseen at the moment. Therefore, the argument does not get us anywhere. There is one point, however, on which I would like to record my agreement with Deputy Shatter. I am of the opinion that if this amendment, as presently worded, is adopted then the Supreme Court will at some time in the future—I am inclined to think it will be the more immediate future—be able to conclude from it, in conjuction with some other provisions of the Constitution, that there is an absolute right to life for everybody in the State, whether born or unborn and that right to life enjoys absolute protection even against the State itself. This would involve the Legislature being forced to abolish capital punishment. I would enthusiastically agree with that development. It would be very desirable. I want to come back to the point that we can do anything with the wording of [2011] any legislative provision if we examine it sufficiently closely. If you take the words 'defend and vindicate' the right to life of the unborn in the amendment you could argue about those. For example, we presume that in order for the right to life of the unborn to be defended or vindicated abortion will have to be a criminal offence. What sort of penalty would be necessary in order that we could say that the right to life of the unborn was defended and vindicated by the law prohibiting abortion? Would 14 years' imprisonment be sufficient to vindicate the right to life of the unborn? Would ten years be sufficient, or even a year, or would such vindication require 20 years? We can do anything with the wording if we examine it closely enough. If the Supreme Court were to interpret the wording of the amendment at some time in the future in the way in which the Attorney General has envisaged, the court would be going out of its way deliberately to decriminalise abortion. Any court at any time can twist the wording of legislation or the wording of the Constitution so as to make it mean what the court wishes it to mean. We trust our courts not to do that but is the fact that the courts can act in this way at any time a reason for our attempting no longer to make written laws? I do not think it is. I have something to say about the campaign being waged on each side in respect of this amendment. Although I am a member of the Limerick Pro-Life Society I am prepared to say that the tactics adopted by both the pro and the anti people have been deplorable. I have been both sickened and disgusted with this situation and I condemn in the strongest possible terms the tactics being used by both sides. However, while I disagree with some of the tactics being adopted by the pro-life campaigners, their basic motivation is sound. It is the motivation of the anti-amendment people that I question seriously. The immediate and almost instinctive response of the anti-amendment campaigners to the amendment is that it will not achieve anything. On many occasions in my own life, both in a personal and in a professional capacity, [2012] I have found it necessary to advise people that certain courses of action they wished to take would not achieve any objective but having offered that advice I did not go out of my way to work day and night or to generate a lot of publicity or enthusiasm to stop those people from acting as they wished. It is extraordinary that the anti-amendment campaigners have invested such a colossal amount of energy, enthusiasm and finance in order to prevent something which they believe will not achieve anything. Consequently, their motivation must be seriously in doubt. As time goes on their statements and to some extent their membership, if examined closely, may indicate something more sinister than simply protecting the Irish people against themselves. As the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment has said, there are many social problems facing us and there are many antiquated laws which need to be updated and in some cases abolished. There are many thorny issues that need to be tackled. I urge the people, particularly the anti-amendment campaigners, to devote some of their energy to changing and updating those laws which have caused a great deal of hardship, misery and suffering to many Irish people.;2062086

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Patrick J. Morley;Fianna Fáil;In supporting this amendment I might reiterate what the last speaker and others have said here this evening. I welcome the opportunity of supporting this amendment in its original wording. Indeed, I regret the recent change of thinking undergone by the Government in relation to the original wording and which caused distress and anxiety to very many people interested in this pro-life amendment. I was happy last week to hear the Taoiseach say in this House that he expects to have alternative draft wording within two weeks. Debate adjourned.;2062087
179;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Jim Tunney;Fianna Fáil;I am sure that here or elsewhere we are familiar with the speaker who gives an assurance as to brevity and then burdens his listeners with thoughts which take an hour or two for revelation. I assure you that I will be the exception to that and I hope I will be finished within 15 minutes. The proposed legislation comes before us from the Coalition Government. I wish to remind the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, of that fact. Its history is well known. It arises from the concern of some people in the community as to the position of the unborn and to the uncertain and delicate position which exists in the Constitution in respect of the unborn, a position as delicate and uncertain as its own existence. Most people, having become aware of that position, alerted me and representatives of other parties to the situation and I had no hesitation in accepting their reminder. That represents the total blackmail and hijacking that the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, talks about in respect of my position. Other people can speak for themselves. I have sympathy with the people concerned and have no hesitation in indicating to the House that it will be my pleasure to vote for the amendment. Deputy Manning spoke about agreement with regard to the wording. A form of words had been agreed upon by the former Government, after consultation with the best legal brains available to them. The form of words was agreed, presented and subsequently accepted by the present Government. That agreement is good enough for me. It may not be good enough for other people, that is their entitlement. Deputy Manning also said that some legal men are not as happy as others with the wording. This, inevitably and unfortunately, has been the history of legal men since I first became acquainted with them. There will never be unanimity among any group of legal men on any point so I do not think we should spend too much time in providing for the unlikely eventuality of every legal [2031] person being unanimous about anything, especially the matter that is before us. To say that there are politicians and Taoisigh-designates who would, on the eve of an election, present themselves to the public without giving full thought to what was promised, especially on such a serious matter as this, and to excuse them then subsequently for having done so is a reflection on and an insult to every politician in the House. I do not want to appear sanctimonious but I would not do it. I am here since 1969 and I have been lobbied prior to elections by different people and organisations. Before the last general election a half dozen of my constituents asked me to sign a document that would protect the workers in Ranks bakery. I said that because I could not predict what was going to happen in respect of the bakery I was sorry I could not put my name to any promise. I do not wish to present myself as being holier-than-thou but, generally speaking, although there may be exceptions, as in every other profession, politicians do not yield to every pressure put upon then. The Deputy spoke about other people who are concerned about certain matters and that we are setting a precedent. Let them press their problems. It is a matter for this House to decide whether or not their entitlement is as forceful or as meritorious as they advocate and, that having been done, we are obliged to represent those people. We are not here to resist them. We all take support, consolation and direction from our constituents, and from people in other constituencies. It would be wrong to give the impression that legislation can only emanate from the combined thoughts of those who are elected here and that we should never be receptive to suggestions from anybody outside this House. It was accepted by the last Government that such an amendment was desirable. There was agreement as to the form of words, accepted by the present Government. I recollect that when the Taoiseach was asked about the unexpressed position of the Labour Party and the position in which he would find himself if he were Taoiseach living up to the promise which [2032] he had made of having this introduced before the end of March, he said there would be no difficulty at all, that even in circumstances where the Labour Party might not support it, as was their right, the Fine Gael Party, if Fianna Fáil supported them, would be able to put it through. I regret that Deputy Quinn is not present. Did he express the reservations which he made here today prior to the last general election? Did he say all the things he is saying here? When, subsequently, he was privy to whatever negotiations took place prior to the establishment of the Government, did Deputy Quinn indicate that he was unhappy and unprepared to serve under the Taoiseach whose Government would introduce this legislation? If he said he did then my opinion of him, and respect for him, would be greater but if he did not then I must attribute to him the hypocrisy he presumes to attribute to other people. My position in this has been consistent but I do not think one should look for any great credit because of that. As I see it, everybody in Ireland is anxious that the position of the unborn should be protected. How one can move from that position into an area of alleged sectarianism, bigotry or the freedom of Ireland I find difficult to accept. If the freedom of Ireland depends upon, in the minds of some, the murder of the unborn then it is a freedom I never want to see. If members of other religions or beliefs feel as keenly about this as some of their presumed spokespersons would indicate, I am surprised. In my constituency there are many people who differ from my religious beliefs but they have not expressed their concern to me in the fashion that was expressed today. I do not think there is anything sectarian or over-zealous in the matter of religion for me to say that I have an interest in and am concerned for the protection of the unborn. How can anybody argue that that is a sectarian statement? Contrary to the present fashion in the matter of religion and what I see as an effort or a tendency for whatever purpose to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator, I believe the need of the times in [2033] which we live is religion in action, not a watering down of everything to a point where nothing exists at all. In this regard I may be arguing against the fashion of the moment but I would like to see everybody as convinced about their beliefs as I am about mine. I do not wish to impose my beliefs on anybody. I have never done so and I never will but I hope all people will be as happy about their beliefs as I am about mine. I do not propose to make any apologies for my beliefs and I do not believe members of other Churches would respect me if I did so. I have moved slightly into the area of religion and accepting the thwarting of the Minister of State in the matter of this being sectarian. I know I should not do that but on the other hand the time has come when I do not have to be making apologies for our beliefs when nobody can demonstrate to me that my beliefs are in any way prejudicial, injurious or insensitive to my neighbour. If that proof is given to me I shall readily withdraw and apologise. We get respect from those who differ from us in accordance with the way we practise, not what we say. This alleged concern for the members of other religions is not as sincere as it may seem. That is as far as my sympathy will allow me comment on it. Deputy Manning said we were being rushed into something. I do not have any great feeling of being rushed. It is possible that Deputy Manning feels he has been rushed but we have been dealing with this for some time. The matter has been before the people for a year or more. I do not see any great element of undue expedition. The point has been made that outside groups are showing an interest in this. There are groups on either side and that is their entitlement. I would not be critical of any person or group if they feel they should apply themselves to follow a particular course legitimately. That is their entitlement. We have too many people practising subversion, vandalism and many unwelcome and unnecessary measures. It is heartening and wholesome to think that there are people who will apply themselves to having changes brought about in a fashion [2034] which is their entitlement and which has been provided for. 'Ordinary people outside' is a term I would never use. Apart from other considerations it presupposes that the person who uses that term considers himself or herself in some extraordinary fashion. We are all servants of the people outside. We must keep reminding ourselves of that. I was quietly amused to hear Deputy Gregory in a very conservative fashion — it reminded me of a form of conservatism that is long gone — questioning the right of people outside to lobby him about anything. I do not think Deputy Gregory accepts that premise as applying to everybody. His membership of the House has probably arisen from the fact that he was prepared to act as the spokesperson for people in his constituency and achieve for them material gains which were their entitlement but were denied to them for a long time. That was his entitlement and his response to the will of a certain group of people. All credit to him for that. He acted perfectly in doing that. However, having done that it is strange to hear him suggest that I, or any other Member, should give a deaf ear to those with whom we may have a certain sympathy or a certain affinity. The inconsistency of that does not appeal to me. The inconsistency of the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, does not appeal to me. He criticised all and sundry for being emotive about this issue and went on to say that Members on this side of the House — I suppose he included his constituency colleagues, the Taoiseach and Deputy J. Doyle — were being hijacked, blackmailed and intimidated to indulge in what he called a farce. That was the commentary of Deputy Quinn on the Taoiseach who appointed him and on his colleague who has the pleasure, honour and privilege of representing the constituency that also sends Minister of State Quinn here. He went on then to what I call a rather illogical point where, while being critical of what has happened here, he criticised the Supreme Court and the Constitution. He criticised the Supreme Court for interpreting the Constitution in a fashion which was prejudicial to tenants in certain [2035] houses in this city. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot on the one hand criticise the Supreme Court, criticise the Constitution and allege a certain disregard on the part of the rest of the Members of this House for what I would suggest are more pertinent, more important matters and at the same time point the finger at people, Members of this House, who are taking a certain action prompted perhaps by the wisdom of the seanfhocal 'Ní hé lá na gaoithe ...' so that we can protect the unborn in this country. If what we are doing had been done by people on whose behalf Minister of State Quinn speaks in connection with his interests on behalf of the tenants of those landlords, then the problem and the injustice to which he refers would not have arisen. You, Sir, did not occupy the Chair when I promised the Ceann Comhairle that it was my intention not to speak beyond 15 minutes. I calculate that 12 minutes have now passed and I propose to stay with my promise, for what reasons I do not know. Perhaps it is (1) to avoid repetition (2) in deference to a discovery which I have made about myself that my initial decision may be superior to my reason and if I were to move into the field now of the men with long gowns and wigs as described by Pádraig Pearse and into the field of words, my reasoning may detract from what I think is the justification and correctness of my decision and my pleasure to vote for this amendment. Contrary to what my colleague, Deputy Manning, would say, the sooner that opportunity comes to me the better. In the hope that the words presented will be the words decided upon by the last Fianna Fáil Government, accepted by the present Taoiseach, voted on by people in the last election, the sooner that wording for the promised amendment comes the better I will like it.;2062088
180;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Maurice Manning;Fine Gael;I made it clear some time ago that I am not particularly enthusiastic about this amendment. I said that, if there was a free vote on this amendment, certainly I would be voting against it. I made it clear at that time, and do so again, that a free vote can only operate when it is free all round, when the Whip is lifted on all parties and when all parties agree that a question is left emphatically to the individual decision of the Deputy. That is not the case in this debate. At the outset, may I say I will be voting with my party in favour of the amendment in line with the commitment given by my party in the general election. I regret that this is so, because if ever there was a case for a free vote in this House this is one. I have no doubt that, if there was a free vote, the referendum would be held, that there would be in this House a sizeable majority voting out of conviction for the holding of this referendum. If there was a free vote I believe that vote would more accurately reflect the true feelings of people in this House on the question of whether or not this referendum should be held. Certainly it would be a much more accurate reflection of what is the true feeling in this House. It would also be very much in line with what I believe is the true feeling in the country, not on the question of abortion [2019]— because if ever there was an issue on which there is almost universal concensus it is against abortion — but on whether or not it should be necessary to hold this referendum. Anybody here who reflects what she or he hears knows that throughout the country the people are divided on whether or not there should be a referendum. We Deputies come across it each day. I come across it talking to students. I come across it in my constituency, in the pub. I come across it talking to old people and young people, men and women. We all know that people are disagreeing on whether or not there should be a referendum. They are doing this calmly, in good faith. They are doing it without abusing each other's motives. They see it as an issue on which it is possible to have honest doubts as to whether an amendment is a good thing at present or ever. It is possible to disagree without being bitter about one's opponents without casting doubts on their bona fides, without thinking that anybody who opposes the holding of a referendum is in some way ambivalent on the basic question of abortion. That is the position in the country. That is how people see it in urban and rural Ireland and across all age groups. All of us who go to meetings, as all of us do in this House will see first of all that very many people are not particularly turned on by this whole issue anyway but those who are are much more open-minded in their approach than is the official party line in both of the major parties in this House. It is a question on which there is room for honest doubts and disagreement. It is a pity that in this debate we here cannot be as open and as honest as are the ordinary people outside the House. It is a pity also, and I regret it, that we in this House have allowed what is an extremely important and sensitive moral issue to become a political football and, in some cases, though happily in very few, to be used to denigrate the integrity of opponents or used for immediate political advantage. I have listened carefully to most speakers in this debate and have read what everybody has said. I would say that the [2020] tone of the debate has been at a very high level: for the most part the tone of the debate has been one of tolerance and of at least attempting to understand the case even if one did not necessarily agree with it. A lot of the credit for this must go to Deputy O'Hanlon, the new Fianna Fáil spokesman on Health, who set a very balanced and dignified tone for this debate. I would take certain exception to what Deputy O'Dea said. I do not belong to any group. I make up my mind on this matter as best I can. I have written to both sides, I have talked with both sides and have read what I could. I believe that no side has a monopoly of intolerance or bigotry in this matter. There are extremes on both sides. But I regret very much that Deputy O'Dea felt compelled to bring into question the good faith of the vast majority on the anti-amendment side. No less than those on the pro-amendment side they are trying to be honest, and trying to speak with conviction on what to all of us is an important and central question. I am sorry he saw fit to cast doubt, indeed almost to introduce an element of smear, on some of those people, especially since they are not in a position to reply under the privilege of the House. I want to outline the reasons why I am most unenthusiastic about holding this referendum. Like Deputy Gregory-Independent and Deputy Kelly and many others who spoke, I am very unhappy about the way in which this amendment came about. As is now well known, commitments were given without proper debate, without proper thought, and without proper consultation. They were given without the type of reflection which should always precede any change in the law, and which most emphatically should always precede a change in our basic law, the Constitution. We all know there were election pressures. We all know there is a degree of distrust between the leaders of the two main parties in this House which probably has not been equalled since the first decade of the State. Perhaps in part that explains why the party leaders were so quick to rush in. Perhaps it explains why [2021] there was not fuller consultation on a matter which should never have been agreed to at such short notice and without a proper, full debate. During the election campaign those of us who had doubts should have come out and said so. I expressed my reservations to people who spoke to me. I said there was a commitment to the holding of a referendum and that commitment would be honoured. That is the position today. Those of us who had reservations were caught up in the rush of events. I am not apologising for that now. I am not particularly proud of it but it happened. We were afraid that what seemed to be a peripheral issue, a red herring, would become a central issue in the campaign, and the main thrust and the main concern of the election would be side-tracked. I agree emphatically with Deputy Kelly that all parties in this House should have a self-imposed embargo on commitments made, as he said, in the octave of an election period when groups find political parties at their most uncertain. All politicians are like this. There is no point in people on the opposite side adopting a holier-than-thou attitude. All politicians are nervous before elections. Pressure groups know they have politicians in a vulnerable position. That was never more true than over the past year or two, given the record of political instability and the fevered atmosphere of Irish politics during that time. This pressure group exploited that situation brilliantly and effectively. I do not blame the pro-amendment people for having done that. They saw an opportunity. They were deeply concerned to get their point of view across and to achieve an objective, and they used that opportunity brilliantly. They did it effectively and in good faith, and that is why this House is having a debate today on this amendment. I am unenthusiastic about holding a referendum on this amendment because of the principle involved in the way it was rushed into the House. My second reason for my lack of enthusiasm about this amendment is that I feel very deeply we should not change our Constitution until all other means of achieving the desired [2022] objective have been explored. There is no urgency at present about this question. There is no case before the High Court let alone the Supreme Court to change the law on abortion. As Deputy John Kelly, who is the foremost constitutional expert on this subject, pointed out changes in the Constitution do not take place overnight. There will be at least a year's notice, and perhaps two years, while the process works its way through the legal system. As he also pointed out, the entire ethos of our courts system is very different from that of the other legal systems cited by those who fear, and perhaps fear very genuinely, that they could wake up in the morning and find the law has been changed. That will not happen. The process is much more lengthy and the ethos of our courts is very different. There is no urgency, no pressure about this. There is no immediate threat, no immediate danger. For that reason, the whole question should have been examined much more carefully and at greater length in the normal legislative process. Normally when we face a difficult question we set up an all-party committee. We know that in changing the Constitution there should be as wide a degree of consensus as possible. We know the matter should be fully examined, all the possibilities should be studied in detail, the best possible expert advice should be got not outside the House but inside the House. That is why we have all-party committees. That has always been the approach to changing the Constitution. At least there is a proper in-depth examination and a major public debate beforehand. We have plenty of time for that approach. There is no immediate threat. Yet no attempt has been made — not even a start was made in this House — to examine the present situation, to ask ourselves if the existing legislation, the 1861 Act, is in danger of becoming outdated or needs to be strengthened. We made no attempt to see in what ways our social services or our educational services could be improved to prevent the very thing we are talking about, that is, to prevent people having to seek abortions. [2023] We did not begin to examine those questions. There is a whole range of allied aspects of this matter which we as legislators, we as the elected Parliament, should have examined. We should have sought the best possible advice to see if the law was working and whether it needed strengthening. Then in here we should have examined in detail whether there was a possibility at some stage in the future of this legislation being found unconstitutional. That debate should have taken place in the calmness of a committee of the whole House, away from fevered political activity, away from the pressures of elections, away from the immediate concerns of this House. That would have been a simple process. That is the way it should have been done. That process was not engaged in and it reflects badly on this House that it was not done. On the few occasions in our history that we changed our Constitution, we did not rush lightly into changing it. We did not say it must be done as quickly as possible, that there was not time for a full debate, that we would not utilise the existing process of examination and the existing means by which parliament itself could strengthen the legislation or find out what difficulties or weaknesses existed in it. Everyone in this House, from whichever party, surely has sufficient respect and reverence for our Constitution to agree that changing it is something which should not be undertaken lightly or in a hurry. We should approach changing our Constitution at a much slower pace and only when all other devices have failed. The case for immediate change and an immediate referendum has not been made. We have not even begun to exhaust the possibilities in this House of strengthening the legislation and achieving the objective all four Deputies sitting in the House want to achieve. I am certain all four of us are at one in the objective we wish to achieve. We are sitting in a sovereign parliament but the initiative did not come from us. It was not set by the political parties but from pressure from outside groups. As a parliament we have ceded a certain amount of our [2024] respect and sovereignty in not standing up and doing it our way. Any other approach represents a partial abdication of our responsibilities. I am speaking about the way in which this Bill came before us. It may be that the end result will be that we will see the referendum on the same wording but let us do it in such a way that the self-respect of the House is not damaged. In the twenties the founders of the State took the view that the Constitution should be easily amended. If 75,000 people signed a petition requring a constitutional change a referendum would be held. This was in tune with the thinking at the time that democracy should be made as accessible as possible. That device was abolished in 1928 because the Government of the day saw that there was a clash between the sovereignty of the Government and easy access to referenda. This abolition was opposed by Mr. de Valera at the time but in 1937 when he drew up his own Constitution he made no attempt to introduce this popular initiative. He saw clearly that there could be a clash between the two different concepts of Government. This clash is best illustrated in the experience of modern France where Charles de Gaulle, who hated parliament and parliamentarians, consistently used the referendum as a weapon against them and played down the power of parliament. He did this with purpose and with considerable success. Mr. de Valera with wisdom saw that easy access to a referendum could undermine the position of parliament since parliaments from time to time have to make hard decisions and take unpopular measures. One of the reasons for a five-year parliament is to protect it from the fury of the people. Mr. de Valera, who spoke so strongly on this issue nine years earlier, made no attempt to have easy access to a referendum. In fact he designed his Constitution to ensure that referenda would be initiated by parliament. The practice through the years has been that a referendum is not undertaken lightly and the pressure for one comes from within the House and not outside. There are some who feel that this is a bad system and that the Constitution is [2025] too remote. Some would like to see us going back to the system which operated in 1922 but which was later abolished. When this referendum goes through there will be a move back to the old position and there will be pressure from outside to hold referenda on a wide variety of issues, some of which have been mentioned. We are setting a precedent in that the House is responding to outside pressure. I am not judging whether this is good or bad. Perhaps it is good. There will be other pressing and important issues on which constitutional change will be demanded and it will be hard to answer the arguments put forward. If ACRA say there should be a referendum to abolish ground rents it will be difficult to deny them the right to hold a referendum. If the divorce action group say they have reliable information that over 50 per cent of the people believe that divorce is a constitutional right and that the Constitution should be changed in relation to the whole concept of marriage and divorce can we say that they do not have a right to hold a referndum? If some group say that the concept of Irish neutrality must be enshrined in the Constitution as something that is unchangeable for all time and they say they have survey data which shows that 75 per cent of the people want this, can we say they cannot have a referendum or that the changing of the Constitution must begin in this House? Perhaps we should go back to the 1922 model of the Constitution and encourage direct popular democracy. It would make our lives much easier. We would not have to make hard decisions and we could blame the people if things went wrong and say: 'You voted 60/40 in favour of a particular issue'. There is an important precedent being established in so far as changing the Constitution in future is concerned. Perhaps that is good but let us be clear that we are now inviting other groups to have an equally legitimate case to say: 'At least give us a chance to let the people speak directly on this matter.' It will be hard to resist some of the cases which will be made. For these two reasons I am unenthusiastic about the referendum — the way in which it was initiated and the [2026] danger I see to the constitutional practice involved. I do not believe that the proposed wording is sectarian. The word 'sectarian' is used too loosely in this context. There is a certain amount of woolliness on the part of those who oppose the amendment and this charge has been unjustly thrown at many of those who support it. I have certain mild criticisms to make on the role of the Protestant Churches in this matter. A certain amount of confusion was caused by the early statement of the Protestant Churches that they did not see anything wrong with the wording proposed. Later they said they had difficulty with it. Like politicians, I understand that they had the same pressures of time in this regard but I would have preferred if they had been more authoritative on the matter. A certain amount of confusion is laid at their door. I have not been fully convinced by all of Dean Griffin's arguments. Some of what he has said could be termed sectarian. I do not think the wording is sectarian but this is the first time in our history that we are rushing forward with a measure about which most of the Protestant Churches and those of the Jewish faith have reservations. That those reservations should be expressed publicly should give us some cause for thought. On the question of sectarianism, much was said about the intolerance of Northern Protestants and what right had they to lecture us on the creation of a tolerant society. To argue along these lines is to go for a wrong but easy answer. We do not take our standards in this House or this country from bigotry. We do not compare ourselves to those who have disgraced the name of tolerance and religion in Northern Ireland over the decade. We are a proud and independent republic. We have always prided ourselves on respecting the rights of minorities. We do this because it is right. We do not do it for any other reason. It is not to impress the people in Northern Ireland or elsewhere. For that reason the reservations of the Protestants and other groups have to be taken very seriously. For that reason, if [2027] for no other reason, we should take our time and make sure everything has been fully discussed, because no matter what we do here it will be seen by our enemies in Northern Ireland as wrong. We cannot change that, so let us make it clear that, when we say we are worried about the reservations of Protestant leaders and Protestant churches, we are worried for the right reasons — because it is the right thing to do and is part of our tradition and if we do not do it the word 'republicanism' has no meaning. If we can do that we can reassure the many Protestants in Northern Ireland who are kindly disposed to this part of the island that this is not the case of a majority steamrolling minority groups into submission on a sensitive moral issue. In many ways that is how it has been represented, and we can reassure the many Protestants in this part of the country who are worried that this is not the case either. When I made my maiden speech in the Seanad it was on a constitutional crusade initiated by the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald. I thought the idea of a constitutional crusade was a good thing, an exciting innovation in Irish politics and I still think so. After 40 years of the present Constitution, excellent in most respects, we have reached the stage where a comprehensive, objective, free-ranging review would be good for all of us and for the Constitution itself. Any change in the Constitution at the present time should be part of that overall review. I mentioned earlier that there is no pressure, no urgency, for this new legislation. There is no case before the High Court, let alone the Supreme Court. If we are talking about changing the Constitution there is every case for bringing forward this pro-life amendment and making it part of an overall, constitutional review where the full working of the Constitution would be examined freely and objectively. I regret that rushing forward with this referendum is going to blunt the impetus for other necessary constitutional changes which I believe are urgently needed and highly desirable — not to impress the people in Northern Ireland but because there are aspects of [2028] our society and Constitution which, in the interests of all the people, deserve to be looked at carefully, if not to be changed. On the controversy of the wording of the amendment, I was very pleased to hear Deputy D. Andrews, whom I regard as one of the most thoughtful humane members of the Opposition, make a plea for an agreed form of wording. Deputy D. Andrews no more than many people must share the deep sense of unease felt by so many eminent lawyers and doctors who have told us the present proposed wording is inherently dangerous, and that there are implications and consequences which could be the exact opposite to what was intended by those most in favour of the amendment. I am not one to rush in when doctors and lawyers are discussing matters which very often are above the heads of most of us. But if eminent disinterested lawyers and doctors tell us, out of public duty and concern, that the wording is defective and could have consequences which would be the exact opposite of what was intended, the least we owe them is to take what they say seriously, listen to what they say and try to get a better form of wording. I am worried by the insistence of some of those pro-life people that the present form of wording is perfect, cannot be improved on and that we are insisting that this from of wording go ahead. Let us take pause on this matter and get agreement. If we are going to have wording it should be possing to discuss this matter away from the party whip and get the most acceptable form of wording possible. This is a matter on which, as Irish people seeking the same ultimate objective, it is almost obscene to talk in terms of rigid party lines, with one group having a monopoly of wisdom or right on this question. I regret that this amendment has come before this House the way it did. One consequence of this campaign may well be, as the eminent Dominican, Dr. Fergal O'Connor, pointed out at the end of an extremely thoughtful essay, to promote an increasing awareness among people of abortion and create what he called an abortion mentality. I hope he is [2029] wrong, but he is one of the most prophetic people I have met and I am afraid he may be all too right, that the end result of the debate may be very different to what was intended by those who initiated the campaign. I regret, as did Deputy O'Dea and others, some of the language that has surrounded the debate, especially the too easy branding of those who were anti-amendment as pro-abortion. Those who have indulged in that practice did not do themselves or their cause any good. The campaign in this House has been an honest one, but outside I am afraid some of the tactics used by people on both sides have often fallen far short of truth and honesty. I regret the way we have rushed into this whole question of constitutional change when there was no immediate pressure or external threat. This is a matter which requires and deserves calm deliberation and the least we can have is the fullest possible consultation with all interested groups. I regret that we have rushed in without taking enough time to examine fully the views of all minority churches. I also regret that we may do our well deserved tradition and reputation for respecting minority points of view harm from which we will not easily recover. I regret too that so sensitive an issue, on which there is almost certainly national consensus, has been used in some cases for narrow political ends, which reflects no credit on those who so used it. It is clear we are going to have a referendum because the majority view in this House is that there should be one. In that case let us put aside party differences, put our heads together and, without bitterness, get the best possible form of words. Let us raise the debate both here and outside the House above party differences and show greater tolerance and understanding so that, when the tumult and shouting have died down and when whatever bitterness there is dies away, we can get down to the much more fundamental and important task of trying to eradicate those conditions which have made abortion such a dreadful scourge in modern society. Then at least we will be [2030] talking in genuine terms about a proper pro-life amendment.;2062089
181;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Ruairí Quinn;The Labour Party;When I was last speaking on this measure I was voicing my concern at the way this debate had degenerated. The degree of degeneration has been augmented, in my experience, by the hate mail one receives, anonymously or not, when one voices one's reservations about the appropriateness of an amendment to change the Constitution on any matter. It is a sad reflection that when someone voices a clear argument, to my way of thinking an irrefutable argument, against amending the Constitution in this manner, one gets hysterical letters through the post. Those letters are prompted and promoted by the kind of nonsensical argument we have heard from both sides of this House, from people who think the argument is about abortion when it is not. I put on record my considered reservations to this farce the last day and I do not propose to take up the time of the House repeating them. I want to say loudly and clearly, and to put on the record, the fact that this debate has degenerated to such an extent that nobody knows any longer what precisely we are talking about or, more to the point, why we are talking about it. It has all the hallmarks, regrettably, of a sinking democracy and could be likened to people frantically running around the submerging deck of a Titanic arguing about the exact placement of deck chairs. We take it for granted in this House that there is an inbuilt and implicit support for the democratic process and that our young people and the young people in Europe will automatically recognise the wisdom, efficiency and justice of a democratic system because it is a better alternative to what Europe has experienced in the past. That is a great and frequently unquantified assertion on our behalf. It is quite clear, given the degeneration of democratic politics in the North, that the sole, sane voice of democratic politics on the non-Unionist side in Northern Ireland is being substantially and consistently eroded by democratic terrorists in the form of Provisional Sinn Féin, with, to quote their own phrase, [1995] the ballot paper in one hand and the Armalite in the other. How can we, as a democratic Assembly, justify our relevance, efficiency or equity if we say to the public, especially to young people, that we are spending endless hours in academic debate in this Chamber about changing the Constitution, which will not have the slightest effect upon the issue about which we are all supposed to be concerned, abortion, because not one single physical change will result in society and the situation of women who find themselves pregnant? We have been blackmailed into changing the Constitution, which will achieve nothing, at a time when our Constitution is crying out to be changed because it is a barrier to social justice in three specific areas. The first is one which is close to my constituency because of the historical nature of the housing stock. We have no statistical figures on which to base our arguments but the consensus is that somewhere in the region of 30,000 people are affected by the removal by the Supreme Court of rent control legislation on the grounds that it was deemed to be inimical to the private rights of property owners and landlords in particular. As a consequence of this, legislation went through this House, the first measure was found to be unconstitutional and the second is currently being challenged by an individual solicitor in this city. As a result of that action at least 30,000 people are directly affected by the way a particular historical group of Supreme Court judges interpreted the property clauses of the Constitution. If Deputies went to a meeting of the tenants affected by that legislation they would be convinced of the relevance and of the pressing social necessity to redress the balance within the Constitution between the legitimate rights of private property and the need to get a balance for the common good. Where is the amendment campaign to achieve that? Nowhere. The people I am talking about are mainly elderly, single or widowed and on fixed incomes and are literally living in terror. We had the scandal recently in our so-called democratic courts of an 87 [1996] year old woman being hauled into the witness box, asked to take the oath and to describe the housing circumstances under which she lived, the income she derived from some pensions and made feel she was a criminal for having lived all her life in the same house which she considered to be her home, a house which the landlord forgot he owned. The Constitution we are rushing to amend is inviolate in this matter and cannot be touched because of the sacred nature of property here. If we amend the Constitution in relation to abortion it will not make any difference to the 30,000 on the housing lists of local authorities. Land is being sold at a scandalously high price and we do not seem to be able to curb it. Last week, this House agreed to establish a committee to deal with the price of building land. Tomorrow, the Seanad will agree to a similar measure and a committee will be established. Since 1980, the Attorney General's Office, under three successive Ministers for the Environment, have been requested to give an opinion on the constitutionality of measures to deal with the scandalous abuse of land. So far, the Attorney General's Office have found themselves incapable of providing an opinion. Do you know what the guy who is responsible for that file is doing at the moment? He is dreaming up some new wording for this farce. That is what he is doing in a time of economic catastrophe, that is the deployment by the majority democratic forces represented in this House of scarce public skills in the Attorney General's Office. What claims have we on our young people for the automatic and continued support for the democratic process when this kind of nonsense goes on? Marriages are breaking down in our society and there is no proper or effective legal framework with which to deal with reality, nor the possibility that something might happen in the future, which is the case upon which the pro-amendment people base their claim. They argue it is necessary now to change our Constitution in such a way as to prevent some future body of people introducing legislation. Have we achieved such a degree [1997] of democratic efficiency and success in this Legislature that we can afford the luxury of resolving problems which have not yet arisen, when all around us there is a range of problems which are crying out for solutions, to which solutions exist and which ordinary people, who have been made to feel criminals in their own homes, feel should be solved? What kind of a society do we claim as the correct and legitimate heir to the proud republican tradition of 1916 and 1921? That is my cri de coeur to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The argument I make is open and honest. Both parties know they were hijacked by a well-organised and skilful moral blackmail operation at the height of an election campaign. Whatever about conservatives in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, there is no room in my book of tolerance for so-called liberals in both parties who want to be on both sides of the road in this issue. If they exist let them speak freely and openly on this issue. Alternatively, let them show how they can justify the utilisation of this large, elaborate and expensive decision-making machine called the Oireachtas to set in motion in this House and in the Seanad and then with the ordinary people by way of a referendum, a campaign which will not change one comma, sentence, clause or paragraph of any law in the land that currently relates to abortion. There is no responsive argument to contradict what I am saying in relation to this issue. The only way the supporters of this farce can justify their position is to bleat on as they do about how much they are opposed to abortion. I have not heard any Member speak in favour of abortion. We are all at one on this issue. All political parties have clearly stated that they are not in favour of introducing abortion legislation—end of story. Why are we utilising the time and energy of the Attorney General, who should be doing his job on the question of land legislation instead of trying to do some type of semantic gymnastics to produce a formula of words that will say everything but not mean anything? That is the legal task the Attorney General has been set not just by the [1998] Government but by the former Administration also. The tragedy at the end of the day, as this farce proceeds inevitably onwards to the predictable victory it will have overwhelmingly in the House, is that the more the people who are in favour of the amendment argue for its support on the grounds that it is about abortion the more they build up the view that there are thousands on the island who are allegedly pro-abortion. We will live to learn bitterly that we have created a harvest that will some day be collected by others. The more those who are in favour of the amendment try to force us into the position of saying that we are pro-abortion, which we are not, and the more they try to cast that argument on those lines, when the votes are counted if the logic of their argument is sustained then there will be numbered on this island thousands of people who allegedly are pro-abortion. That is not the case. The irony at the end of this expensive, wasteful and shameful episode will be the creation of a false support in favour of something to which everybody is opposed in overwhelming terms. It never ceases to amaze me — I make this statement as much about myself as about others — how strong, forceful and full of emotion men can be about a topic which in the final analysis exclusively concerns women and how silent the voices of women have been, in the House and outside, in relation to this matter. At the end of the day I do not think that anything said here will make it any easier for the women who are faced with this horrible dilemma, as many of them have been, and we know that from the official figures. I do not think that what is said today, or on other occasions, will in any way affect the miserable sad journey that so many are frequently and increasingly taking to England or to other countries to obtain for themselves a termination. We automatically and continuously assume in the House that democracy is well rooted in the Irish people, that Irish people believe in our capacity to use it effectively and that democracy is by definition somehow or other a more efficient, equitable and just way of running society. I put seriously [1999] to the proponents of this amendment——;2062090
182;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Alice Glenn;Fine Gael;At this stage on both sides of the discussion almost everything that is meaningful has been said. At the outset of my contribution I want to make a comment on those both within and without [2036] this House who have seen fit to criticise the Taoiseach for having committed himself to including the promotion of this constitutional amendment in our election policy document. I am certain, and the evidence of volumes of correspondence I have had in relation to the issue prompts me to say, that if he had failed to recognise this issue as of paramount importance to the Irish people he would not be Taoiseach today. That commitment being given, it is essential that it be honoured to the letter. The pro-life amendment is about preventing legal abortion, that is the direct killing of unborn life, for as long as the people of Ireland wish the existing ban to remain. It has no other objective. The passage of the amendment will confer on the most defenceless group within the human community the same constitutional protection as all of us as citizens enjoy. In the submission of the barristers against this amendment, which document was circulated to all Members of this House, they claim that the first and most obvious thing which the amendment would effect would be to acknowledge that for practical purposes in law it confers the right to life on the unborn, that there is no such right in common law nor was such a right ever conferred or acknowledged by statute. Following traditional Christian theology, Common Law distinguishes between moral and thus the legal status of the foetus and that of the child. I say to our learned friends that it is precisely for that reason that this amendment is vital. Mr. William Binchy, writing as chairman of the life, education and research network in the booklet Abortion Now, answers them more eloquently than I could because of his legal expertise. He says that abortion raises legal issues of profound significance which go to the very heart of our legal system. The present law is governed by the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and it is important to look briefly at the two central provisions of that 1861 Act. Having regard to their importance they merit quotation in full. Section 58 provides: Every woman, being with child, [2037] who, with intent to procure her own miscarriage, shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, and whosoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or be not with child, shall unlawfully administer to her or cause to be taken by her any poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable ...to be kept in penal servitude for life... Much talk has taken place about these two sections and I would wager that many people do not realise what the sections are saying. I have not heard the submission of all who have come to this House and if somebody else has seen fit to record this I can only apologise for repeating it, but it is important that on record in this House should be precisely what we are talking about. Section 59 of the 1861 Act provides: Whosoever shall unlawfully supply or procure any poison or other noxious thing, or any instrument or thing whatsoever, knowing that the same is intended to be unlawfully used or employed with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or be not with child, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, Thus the Act never speaks of abortion. Instead it refers to miscarriage, but for practical purposes the terms are interchangeable. Section 58 provides for two different situations. Firstly when a pregnant woman sets out to bring about an abortion on herself she will commit an offence and where any other attempts to bring about an abortion on a woman that person will be guilty of an offence whether or not the woman is pregnant. Thus a professional abortionist will not escape liability by establishing that, contrary to the belief of both the woman and the [2038] abortionist, the woman was not, in fact, pregnant. The history of the abortion laws in most countries indicates a steady progression. We have heard about the risk to the mother's life, abortion based on the mother's health and finally that abortion should be carried out more or less at the discretion of the mother. Sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, set out the existing law on the subject. These provisions have never been analysed in any reported decision in Ireland so it is difficult to be certain how a court would determine some important questions that would arise. These provisions render an abortion an offence without any qualification, unless the word 'unlawfully' is to be interpreted as introducing a qualification. The position of the unborn child under our Constitution is a matter of debate. The Constitution gives no explicit protection to the right to life of the unborn, therefore any protection that may be afforded the unborn child must be implied from provisions which do not specifically address the issue. The matter has not yet been determined in court, so analysis of the problem is necessarily provisional. Some passing references have been made by one Supreme Court judge in the case of McGee versus the Attorney-General. Mr. Justice Walsh adverted to abortion in veiled terms when he said that any action on the part of either husband or wife or of the State to limit family size by endangering or destroying human life would necessarily not only be an offence against the common good but also against the guaranteed personal rights of the human life in question. He was a little clearer in the case of McGee versus An Bord Uchtála in 1979 when he said that a child has the right to life itself and the right to be guarded against threats to its existence, whether before or after birth. He continued that the right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend and to have preserved and defended that life. It should be noted that when Mr. Justice Walsh was making these comments the other judges saw fit to say nothing. His comments were obiter dicta and are not [2039] binding on judges in other circumstances or even on himself. To believe because those things were said that somehow there is a measure of protection would be naive. Most of us feel that the Supreme Court would not now be receptive to giving legal entitlement to abortion, but can we be confident that in the future three members of that court or one member of the High Court will take the same stance? We cannot. It is desirable to refer briefly to the relationship between legislation and the Constitution on the question of abortion. Some people, while welcoming the terms of this amendment as being just and sensible, nevertheless feel that legislation would be a more satisfactory approach. This would be the proper course and the safe approach in a country having no written Constitution or a Constitution limited to the declaration of specific rights without judicial functions of interpretation. Our Constitution is not framed along those lines. On the contrary, we have seen our courts charged with very important and wide-ranging interpretative powers. In the event of a clash between the Constitution and any statutory provisions, the Constitution must prevail and the statutory provisions will be struck down. However satisfactory a particular statute may be thought to be, neither the views of the legislators nor the electorate will be of any avail if the courts take a different view. Whether or not we wish it otherwise, our Constitution is so drafted that the rights of the unborn can be adequately protected only by an amendment. A statutory response would afford no definite protection and, worse, could give rise to a false sense of security. This amendment presents our community with an opportunity to protect the rights of the unborn through our laws. It also forces us to face up to reality. What are the things which have caused people to take this awful step? The passage of the amendment protecting the right to life of the unborn must be supplemented by the social and economic changes necessary to bring about a positive environment for mothers and their children. [2040] In November 1982 the text of the proposed amendment was released. It provided that the State should acknowledge the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right of the mother, should guarantee in its law to defend and vindicate that right. The terms of that amendment met with widespread approval and something of relief, not only from the groups who actively sought the amendment but also from the leading members of the various religious denominations. They included such distinguished Church leaders as the Archbishop of Dublin, the Reverend Dr. McAdoo, and Canon Hartin, both of the Church of Ireland, the Reverend Desmond Gilliland of the Methodist Church, the Reverend W. T. McDowell of the Presbyterian Church, the Catholic hierarchy and the Chief Rabbi. After several months during which those opposing the amendment argued that the amendment would be sectarian, it is extremely gratifying that the most recent poll taken both North and South of the Border shows that the one issue in our time which is a uniting factor and on which there is more common ground than any other is the desire to protect the life of the unborn. The results of that poll published in The Irish Times show that in Northern Ireland 83 per cent of those polled were in agreement with the amendment, as were 87 per cent of people here. That buried once and for all the red herring of sectarianism. At the outset all kinds of red herrings were used as reasons for not proceeding with the amendment. We have buried the red herring of sectarianism and I think even the most ardent anti-amendment campaigners are now ashamed to make any reference to it because it is so ludicrous. Science has made great progress in our time. We do not have to doubt the time when life begins. I now refer to a lecture delivered by Professor Sir William Liley, who holds the chair of perinatal physiology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, at the Tiniest Human Conference organised by the Right to Life Association of Toronto and Area on 5 and 6 October 1979. He stated: [2041] Our generation is the first ever to have a reasonably complete picture of a development of a human being from conception. It was in 1930 that we first observed the liberation of an ovum from the human ovary. It was in 1944 that under a microscope we observed the union of human sperm and ovum. In the fifties were spelled out the event of the first six days of human development as steps with the conceptus on a prodigious journey. In the sixties there were three further advances. For the first time, not only the diagnosis but also the treatment of a child in the uterus became a possibility. Secondly, we were able for the first time to observe the foetus on its home ground and, thirdly the genetic code was cracked, the alphabet established in which is spelled out instructions which guarantee that each one of us is different from every person that ever was and ever will be. One might have thought that these 40 years of discovery which put an end to centuries of guesswork, that this new information would engender a new respect for life before birth and the importance of this stage of life. Instead around the world we see a systematic campaign hell bent on the destruction of the unborn child for every social and medical purpose. Twenty years ago abortion was unthinkable in 75 per cent of the world's population. Now, almost 75 per cent of the world's population are living under abortion laws. This plague has spread across the face of the world. Surely it must cry to Heaven for vengeance. If any other living species on this planet was being hounded and disposed of like the human race there would be a cry around the globe that would rend the place asunder. There is a deadly silence. Why is there a deadly silence about it? It is a profitable business. Many of the interests who are promoting the anti-amendment campaign are doing it for profit. Abortion was introduced in Britain in 1967, in the USA, 1973, France 1975, Germany 1976, Italy 1978, Holland 1981 and the latest victim is Spain. I question Deputy Manning and anybody else who [2042] will stand up in the House and try to tell us that there is no urgency and they do not know what we are on about. I suggest they do some reading about the progress of this scourge. It is as plain as a pikestaff to me that time is not on our side. I was very pleased when I heard my colleague, Deputy Eileen Lemass, refer to Madame Simone Veil, who has the doubtful distinction of having introduced abortion to France, which she seems to boast about. She commented at the European Parliament in February 1981 that all pressures which could be brought to bear on states who did not have satisfactory abortion legislation would be justified. Where would that leave Ireland in the event of a case being brought to the Court of Human Rights? Would those who would be deciding for us be of a similar mind to that of the good lady? After abortion what is the next expediency? When you start to cut out one generation it will automatically affect another. Many countries in central Europe are now seriously feeling the effects of their abortion laws. Last Friday at a medical gathering of doctors from central Europe I was told that in Holland they are now paying women to hurry up and have babies because they will have no workforce in ten to 15 years time. The difficulty is that while you are waiting for the children to grow to maturity and become a tax paying element, which is essential in all economies, there will be many old people who will not have the taxpayers there to sustain them. The next expediency must automatically be the elimination of the old, the infirm and the handicapped. I have seen all this before. Is that what we are trying to offer the unfortunate young generation? I am not interested in it. I say to those who tell us that we are crying 'wolf' to take a look to what has happened around the rest of Europe. With regard to what we have heard about the terrible medical effects and the dramatic cases which people dream up, it is generally an unfortunate teenager who was raped by a psychopath or something horrendous, which none of us has ever heard happen. Dr. Kieron O'Driscoll was Master of the National Maternity Hospital [2043] for 35 years and I heard him say at one stage that during the course of his medical career there were 250,000 deliveries and not once did any of his colleagues or himself have to sacrifice the life of a mother for the sake of saving a child. There is ample medical evidence to refute all the claims being made about cancer of the uterus and all the rest of it. Those cases are treated in the manner appropriate to the patient at risk. That is another red herring like the sectarian one which now, I believe, because of the integrity of the people in our medical profession who are standing up and telling those people that they simply do not know what they are talking about, can be shot down also. Where does that leave us with the critics? They then tell us that the money which will be spent on the referendum in those difficult times could be better spent somewhere else I believe it will cost £700,000. We pay £1 million a year for our lifeboat services, and they, with God's grace, do not have to go anywhere. Are we saying that it is too costly to save future generations for £700,000 when we are prepared to spend that money on the lifeboat services, or are they so bereft of any kind of balance that they are serious about what they are saying? I have no difficulty in supporting the words of the amendment which are before the House. I accepted them when they were presented and I have since given them a lot of thought. I cannot see that they will not suffice. If they can be strengthened I will be more than pleased. Perhaps a way to strengthen the wording of the amendment would be to insert after 'unborn''from the moment of conception'. That would copperfasten it. It would leave no doubt in anyone's mind as to what we are talking about. Without intending any disrespect to my colleagues here or to those who have gone before us or those who may come after us, experience around the world in relation to the issue in question is ample proof that neither the courts nor the legislators, nor indeed the Church, have been able to stop the spread of this horror. The only safe custodians of God's noble gift [2044] of life are the Irish people. I do not wish either the legislators or the Judiciary to assume this role because, while I have respect for the people who hold office today, there are people in this country even now whom I would not trust with what I regard as being precious. In addition, we live in times of changing patterns in political life. I am prepared to accept the amendment. If it can be strengthened, so be it but not strengthened in a way in which it could be given a dual interpretation. What we must have is a singular understanding of what we are trying to do and I pray that for the sake of coming generations the wisdom of this House will ensure that the necessary amendment will emerge.;2062091
183;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Tony Gregory (Deceased);Independent;Deputy O'Dea has referred to the campaigners on both sides in regard to this amendment and he tells us that, as seems to be the position of other Deputies also, he is involved in the pro-life campaign. At the outset I wish to make it clear that I have not been involved in the campaign one way or the other outside of this House. The decision I have taken has not been taken in response to any campaign but simply on the question of the issue as I see it and my decision has been to oppose the amendment. In the course of this debate I consider it necessary to explain the stand I have taken but before doing that I wish to comment on the contributions that we have had so far in this debate, many of which I have listened to. From the position that has been adopted in the debate it seems to me almost obligatory when speaking on this [2013] issue to preface one's remarks by stating a case for or against abortion. Those who oppose the amendment, either in an organised way or on an individual level, emphasise repeatedly that they see no contradiction in doing so while at the same time opposing abortion. This is a valid argument and one that is crucial to any objective debate on this issue. The emphasis of many Deputies speaking in favour of the amendment has been on the issue of abortion. In many cases they have concentrated on the issue of abortion on demand. I do not see the issue in those terms. I see the primary question as being one of amending the Constitution and of why it should be necessary to do so in this instance. Our law ensures that abortion is not available in this State and no objective observer would suggest that Irish courts would at some time in the future facilitate the introduction of abortion on demand. Furthermore, for those thousands of Irish women who take a decision in conscience and who find it necessary to go to Britain in order to have abortions, the amendment will change nothing. Surely, then, the issue is far more complicated than simply the question of one's moral stand for or against abortion. There are other considerations that are of importance to all of us as well as to this institution but before referring to those considerations I wish to draw attention to one other point. Having said that I am opposed to the amendment and that I will be voting against it, I am conscious of the fact that regardless of how I make use of the debate here to articulate my views, my stand, as well as the stand of any other Deputy who opposes the amendment, will be construed at least by some as adopting a position in defence of abortion. But I do not intend to be influenced by the atmosphere of moral intimidation surrounding this issue. There are people in our society, both inside and outside this House, who have in the past politicised this question and thus abused what is a sensitive moral issue. One Deputy, who made a very excellent contribution earlier in this debate, said 'If I were to vote against it or abstain, it would instantly be misconstrued, sincerely and [2014] accidentally by some, but I have no doubt unscrupulously and maliciously by others'. I have no doubt that there are a great many Deputies who are fearful of being misconstrued, maliciously or otherwise, who are being deeply influenced by that fear and are refusing to speak out against this amendment and against those forces behind it. I must admit to sharing that fear. That threatening cloud has overshadowed from the very beginning what has been termed a pro-life campaign. I share Deputy Kelly's disgust 'that the leaders of the two big parties should have felt compelled in the heat of an approaching election to give an undertaking in a matter so serious as amending the Constitution'. That draws attention to a very important question. Why this urgency — one might almost say indecent haste — with which the referendum is being pursued? Why, amid such desperate social and economic difficulties, should we have a most costly referendum on a matter which is already more than adequately catered for in the law of the land? No responsible Government would, of their own choosing, be so wasteful of time and money when all our efforts should be concentrated on the massive problems of unemployment and growing social inequality. The only reason — and I emphasise the word 'only'— that a referendum is proposed on this issue is because a small, unrepresentative group, using as its modus operandi political and moral blackmail, trapped the main party leaders into an ill-advised and hasty promise prior to an election, at a time when they were at their most vulnerable. This surely elicits a serious question: can anybody agree that this is the way to initiate proposals to change the Constitution of the State? If we are to have a referendum to change the Constitution, then we, the elected representatives, should examine, discuss and agree, calmly and carefully, changes that are urgent and necessary to achieve social advancement for our people. Surely that is the criterion for such a referendum, not the abuse of the democratic process whereby politicians are trapped into a [2015] hasty commitment on a highly emotive and sensitive issue by a group of individuals with no mandate whatever. Any Government which do not stand firm against such intimidation must accept the charge of moral cowardice. It is ironic that when vital questions are raised in this House — for example, the Kenny Report on building land — we are told that this would be difficult to implement because it might prove to be unconstitutional. We then set up a Dáil committee to look further into the question and, hopefully, the issue goes away. It never dawns on us that perhaps that is an urgent question which necessitates constitutional change. There are indeed many other examples of positive changes which could be made if the political resolve existed. The problem of marriage breakdown has been the subject of Dáil questions and has been referred to a Dáil committee. This widespread human predicament, for which the existing law does not provide, is apparently not as urgent as the pro-life amendment, as it is called. I hope that the Minister will explain to the House how major social problems such as those which I have mentioned, which clearly require remedial legislation, can be set aside while a meaningless and unnecessary referendum is thrust on the people. Is it intended to divert or sidetrack attention away from those vital social questions by plunging the country into a pointless emotional crusade? That may not be the intention, but it will certainly be the end result. Another bewildering aspect of this referendum is its sectarian nature, the most ready reply to which charge is that it is not sectarian, despite the fact that all the Protestant churches — Methodist, Presbyterian, Church of Ireland — have stated publicly their opposition to the amendment. Surely, its introduction can only widen the gap between the majority and minority churches and, inevitably, between North and South. This is all the more bewildering since the Taoiseach has been foremost in promising a constitutional crusade designed, in his view, to produce precisely the opposite effect — that is, the bringing together of the different [2016] traditions. How can he reconcile his stated aim of national reconciliation with this narrow, sectarian, unnecessary amendment? That is something which I hope we will hear explained to the House. So blatantly sectarian is the amendment, and now with the public opposition of the Protestant churches, there is a strong case for arguing that the proposed amendment is repugnant to the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of conscience. As the Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral said so succinctly recently: 'You have a right to your opinion and I to mine, but to enshrine one particular denominational opinion in the Constitution is sectarian.' Yet a further contradiction which should not go unnoticed is that, in the midst of cut-backs and calls for financial stringency, an estimated £1 million is to be spent on the referendum. Surely that is an unacceptable extravagance? If the Government were to allocate that money to Women's Aid, or to a special project for itinerant children, that gesture would be far more pro-life than this amendment will ever be. It is noteworthy that the budget included an allocation of around £½ million to be set aside for a new agency to combat poverty — this paltry sum to combat poverty throughout the State while twice that sum is to be literally thrown away on a referendum which will change nothing, will not improve the quality of life of one single child in this State. There cannot be any justification for such extravagance. I can see no intrinsic value in holding this referendum. The only possible justification would be if there were a clearly defined threat to the existing law. If there were a strong lobby calling for abortion on demand and a degree of sympathy in the House to such a lobby, then a referendum would be justifiable. There is no such threat and, indeed, no possibility of that being the case in the foreseeable future. It is evident that the vast majority of the people I represent are opposed to abortion on demand. If this referendum were necessary to uphold the present position, then I would certainly vote for it. However, by any stretch of the imagination the referendum [2017] cannot be seen to be necessary at this time. To say that it is now necessary to change the Constitution is as inaccurate as the term 'pro-life' itself. If those who have spent so much time and effort orchestrating this campaign were genuinely pro-life, then they would take up the cause of the poor and underprivileged and mount a campaign on behalf of the homeless and the jobless, against the inequality and poverty that brings so much suffering to so many of our children. Any SPUC member or pro-life campaigner who does not have a record of work on behalf of the poor must be open to the charge of hypocrisy. Should this amendment be passed then the State's guarantee to protect the life of the unborn inevitably will become as meaningless a phrase as that contained in Article 41, which recognises the family as having imprescriptible rights superior to all positive law. As one of our most prominent historians, Dr. F. S.L. Lyons, points out, here the reality does not approximate even remotely to the ideal — children still go hungry and mothers age prematurely, rearing large families in desperate housing conditions. On the other hand it is significant that many of those individuals and organisations who oppose this amendment have been prominent in seeking social reform to make life more tolerable for the oppressed and disadvantaged. I do not think the same can be said of the SPUC people, as they call themselves. Indeed, one lady Deputy on the Government side of the House, who has been prominent in her association with SPUC since its foundation, sees no contradiction in being associated openly and unashamedly with class-based campaigns against the building of corporation houses in middle class areas and more recently against the Howth hostel for homeless children. I find it exceedingly difficult to understand the logic of that Deputy's concept of the term 'pro-life. Although I accept that I may have chosen an extreme case, those double standards must necessarily be reflected in the entire so-called pro-life campaign to a greater or lesser degree. [2018] As a society we tolerate the extremes of wealth and poverty in which at least a quarter of our people suffer the most acute deprivation. We now wish to declare to the world that we respect the right to life. As a representative of communities where poverty is a part of everyday life, I could hardly support such hypocrisy. When we have a Constitution which guarantees the right of every family to a home, the right of every adult to a job and every child to a full and meaningful education and to health services, then our Constitution will be pro-life. The proposed amendment will not achieve anything positive, only an implied negative smear on those Irish women who make what must be a most tortuous decision. I will have no part in any such smear.;2062092

I am addressing, through the Chair, the Fianna Fáil Party, because they will not even have the luxury of a free vote in regard to this. They, and the ex-Cabinet members of that party, know better than anyone the difficulties encountered by successive holders of the office of Attorney General in relation to the formulation of words that achieves a political objective on the one hand but makes legal nonsense of the Constitution on the other. Fianna Fáil are well endowed with constitutional lawyers who have pointed out all those difficulties. A Member with the eminent experience of Deputy Tunney knows that better than I. In recent times Deputy Tunney has acquired great skills in managing coalition, better than I will ever achieve and I give him that credit.;2062098

191;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Ruairí Quinn;The Labour Party;I am grateful for the Deputy's insistence in regard to this. I should like to point out to the Deputy that the Government are responding to a piece of legislation which was announced immediately after the Government which he supported collapsed. Therefore, one cannot describe it accurately as being one Government's legislation as against another. It happens to be precisely the same wording as far as we know — this is part of the farce — that was originally formulated by a Government of which he was an active and full supporting Member. In fact, Deputy Woods, who is sitting beside Deputy Tunney, was the Minister responsible for introducing the legislation in the first place. Deputy Woods knows better than I, and many others, the legal pitfalls and mine fields surrounding the wording associated with his Government's attempt to respond to what was nothing short of moral blackmail in this matter. Why is it that we automatically assume that our young people will continue to give unqualified and uncritical support to a democratic process that is so manifestly devaluing itself in the eyes of everybody else? I regard myself as a rationalist. I am putting forward what I consider to be rational arguments against this amendment. If some Member can refute my arguments, I am open to accept his or her refutation. I am not locked into a prejudicial attitude against them, but I am saying that there is no tangible, logical or rational reason why we should amend the Constitution in this manner. That is a fixed, locked separate argument. On top of that, to my way of thinking it adds insult to injury to think that the entire elaborate process of constitutional amendment is being used in this instance, while I can cite three separate issues where there is a pressing social need and demand to introduce an amendment. [2001] There are two separate arguments but one can make the connection in terms of pragmatics between the first and the second. I listened to Deputy McCarthy make a contribution last week on a matter that had little or nothing to do with the proposed amendment: the question of abortion and international statistics and the decision of the Supreme Court in regard to it. If Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael wish to bring in legislation reaffirming their opposition to abortion and confirming the 1861 Act, let them do that. I am clear about the way I would vote in regard to that. We are doing something different. We are opening a legal Pandora's Box. Every Deputy around the country who has talked to a half-baked solicitor knows that in the opening of that box nobody knows what will come out of it. Nobody can determine the nature of what will come out of it and, most important of all, nobody can respond to the open-ended legal consequences of what will emanate from such a box when finally opened by some action by a private citizen against the Minister for Health, subsequently the Supreme Court and possibly on to the European Court of Human Rights. I will conclude by saying that we are not doing democracy any service in moving this proposal. All of the political parties, particularly Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, should have the courage and moral strength to stand up to the nation and say, as we have had to say to many economic interest groups, 'I am sorry, the situation has changed. We are not going ahead with this for legal and financial reasons and we give a clear assurance that none of the political parties involved in Leinster House propose to make any change in relation to the question of abortion'—and that would be end of story. We could utilise this time more effectively and efficiently to amend the Constitution in areas that are crying out to be amended and where people are suffering every day as a consequence. If you walk less than half a mile from here on to the first floor of a very inelegant office block building where temporarily the rents tribunal [2002] of the District Court is housed, you will see a scandal going on in relation to the operation and administration of landlord and tenant legislation. Such a scandal was inconceivable to the land-leaguers whose centenary we celebrated last year, and to all of the nationalist and republican forces who coalesced successfully in 1918 and 1920 to achieve partial independence on this island. That in 1982 and 1983 a Supreme Court of the Irish Republic would reintroduce under a de Valera Constitution the powers and rights of landlords to exploit their own with greater legal immunity than Mother England ever gave to them is a kind of tragedy built upon a farce, the farce of this debate and this proposal. I regret bitterly that this House and the major political parties have allowed themselves to be dragged in by this small group of people. It is a reflection on the kind of consensus politics we have that this has been allowed to happen. Finally, I appeal to both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that it is not too late yet to find a face-saving formula that will achieve the objective of the pro-life campaign, which is to ensure that abortion will never be legalised in this country on the one hand, and on the other hand not to use that legitimate aspiration shared by the vast majority of people on this island in a crude, savage and weird attempt at amending the Constitution in a manner that will do no good and no justice to the rest of the country.;2062100
192;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;F;Ms. Mary O'Rourke;Fianna Fáil;I wish to put on record my admiration for the previous speaker and for her very obvious sincerity and total conviction in regard to the points of view she has put before us. It was refreshing for me as a new Member to witness this sincerity and conviction on the part of another Member. Deputy Glenn's closing remarks leave no one in any doubt as to where her priorities lie, not only in relation to this amendment but in relation to values in Irish society today. I wish to add my voice to that of the many speakers from both sides who have pledged their support for the amendment. I am pledged to the wording as put forward, the wording which was put to the Irish people in November last as all-party wording, the wording put forward by Fianna Fáil on their last day in office. Some days late when it looked as if the matter might become an issue in the pending general election, though I do not think anyone wishes that to happen, the now Taoiseach went on record through the media, as did several of his spokespersons, to say that the wording was as near perfect as could be arrived at and that the amendment would not be an issue in the general election. He said also that if his party were returned to office the amendment they would bring before the House would be the amendment as published by Fianna Fáil. In addition, the Leader of the then Opposition said that [2045] he had taken the best possible advice on the matter and that this advice indicated that the wording was accurate and correct. If the wording was accurate and correct in the climate of the run up to the general election, why is the situation any different in the post-election climate? Is it not strange that this change should have come about now? We support the amendment as put forward. It is the kind of positive amendment that was sought in the first instance. There has been much talk of the legal background to this debate but I should like to touch on the sociological implications of many of the aspects involved. I have been listening to various speakers on both sides in the debate so far, particularly some speakers opposite, and I have noticed that last week and today there is emerging the trend that in some way it is wrong for concerned lobbies to press politicians on any issue but particularly on the issue in question. I fail to understand why concerned lobbies should not press their point. Surely that is what democracy is all about. Is it not for all of us to listen to concerned lobbies, to absorb what they have to say and then to give our findings? Some speakers today expressed the view that there was something wrong in approaching politicians with one's point of view. I should like to take issue with one of the groupings involved in the anti-amendment campaign and to take issue especially with the terminology as used in their title. I refer to the woman's right-to-choose group. It may sound very liberal and trendy to say that one should have the right to choose, but to choose what? In the case we are talking of it is a question of the right to choose whether one does away with life or preserves life. So far as I am concerned there is no choice in this matter. If one procreates and conceives life within one, there is then no choice. In other words, choice ends when conception occurs. That is a point that must be made clear. The right to choose is not the right to choose to do away with life. Another point of view put forward by the anti-amendment lobby relates to the [2046] financial aspect of the amendment campaign. In common with the previous speaker I fail to see how the financial aspect can impinge on what is such a very important issue. Therefore, the question of finance is no more than a red herring and should be treated as tritely as should those who are putting it forward. How can finance be the consideration when life is at stake, when we are talking, not about people who can protect themselves, but about people who have no way of protecting themselves? We are talking of the child who is at the mercy of the woman who is bearing him. The sectarian issue has been raised too but, as Deputy Glenn has said, this is one that loses its appeal with each day that passes. The issue in question is the supreme example of what is non-sectarian. It is all embracing. Therefore, the sectarian tag, too, must be seen for what it is. One aspect of this whole area that has not been touched on sufficiently relates to the need for a change in attitude and in perception towards people with unwanted pregnancies. I have given much thought to this problem and I know that there remains in Ireland in many areas what might be referred to as the lace-curtain twitching syndrome whereby when a young girl or a woman who is unmarried finds herself pregnant there is still an element of castigation towards her. Perhaps this is the climate that forces women to take a certain course. It is my hope that when this amendment has been enacted the vital work that has been put into this whole campaign by lobbies concerned for life would then be channelled into creating a climate whereby such women would have access to excellent counselling services, not only at local level but within the community generally. In my local authority area we have been enlightened for quite some time on this matter. Why not? It is not benevolence it is plain human right that an unmarried mother have the right to accommodation for herself and her child. This facility should be more widespread. The community should be educated towards accepting that there are many such cases. Out of this debate on the [2047] entire amendment issue might come a more enlightened and caring attitude towards girls and women who find themselves pregnant and unable to cope. There is an excellent organisation called CURA. I had for a long while felt that they had not publicised their activities sufficiently, but recently on a train journey from the country I was glad to see in the lobby of the local railway station a large advertisement for CURA, giving a private access telephone number and other ways of contacting them. I thought of a young girl boarding the train from the west of Ireland, the midlands, or anywhere else, looking upon this organisation as a lifeline. I would like more openness on this issue. There is no point in pretending that unwanted pregnancies do not happen they happen every day. This is a fact of life in Ireland. I thoroughly support this Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. I abhor the tags which have been put on concerned people. One Opposition Deputy said some weeks ago that he found deplorable the attitude of the pro-life campaign people. This is unbelievable. In the European league we are one of the few remaining countries — I know that there is one other — which have kept their sense of values. I would not like any Member of this Legislature to wish to go down the trendy, liberal path. This is a very clear, fundamental and civil rights issue. It is non-sectarian, with no financial implications. The right to life is a supreme right — not the right to choose, but the right to life. Many would-be opponents of the amendment have brought up issues like rape and incest. The child, conceived, not out of love but out of lust or hate, being a blameless separate entity, is as entitled to life as is the child conceived out of love. In the minds of most of the speakers there is awareness that the problems will not end when this amendment is passed. The minds of all interested people should next turn to the task of ensuring the necessary expert counselling and community and financial support. I would be for strengthening the organisations which give this help and for strengthening the [2048] social services concerned. My mind is clear and unequivocal on this issue. I speak from a very personal conviction and also from my party's viewpoint. I am not blackmailed or boycotted, as some speakers said. I thought about the issue and the important point was the right to life of the unborn child. The wording put forward, which I am supporting, is the ideal wording. I would plead, not for castigation but for compassion in this debate.;2062101
193;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Denis Foley;Fianna Fáil;In supporting this amendment of the Constitution I know I am speaking not alone for myself but on behalf of the majority of my constituents and on behalf of the vast majority of our people. All of us reject abortion as being a terrible crime. I feel honoured to have a chance to express my view in this House on behalf of the people who want us to bolt and bar the door against any possibility that, by mischance or pressure, abortion might be legalised in the Republic. In affording the people an opportunity of recording their rejection of abortion we are obeying the democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution. Abortion is deep-rooted in disrespect for life. The abortion trade is a commercial enterprise yielding substantial profit for its operators. There are pickings to be had by supplying dead, and even live, babies for experimental purposes. The abortion trade exploits the weaknesses, ignorance and downright badness of those who fall into its clutches. This evil trade has been responsible for the deaths of over two million unborn children in Britain. Since abortion was legalised there, by a Private Members' Bill in 1967, the annual number of abortions has been far in excess of 170,000. In the USA the Supreme Court, by a judgment in 1973, made abortion legal. Twleve million American children [2051] were killed before birth as a consequence of that judgment. The annual number of deaths of unborn children in the United States is now a frightening 1,500,000. Even a small country like Denmark, with a population of 5 million, has 25,000 abortions annually. According to United Nations statistics over 55 million unborn children are killed annually by surgical abortion. No war has ever recorded such figures or destruction of human life. It is of vital importance that this Bill to provide a referendum to afford the people the right to insert into our Constitution an amendment protecting the life of the unborn child be passed. It is often claimed that we would be the laughing stock of Europe by inserting this protection into our Constitution but the reverse is true. Many people in many lands would welcome the fact that one country had been able to outlaw this dreadful crime. As for the claim that it is sectarian, this has been completely disproved by the clergymen of four denominations who have proclaimed their support for a total ban on abortion for any reason whatsoever. It has been repeated time and again by gynaecologists that there are no circumstances in which the life of the mother can be saved only through the direct killing of her child. Why then not add a clause to the amendment stating that no law should be enacted permitting abortion of any unborn child at any time from the moment of conception? Anybody who has studied the question knows that the demand for abortion is the work of a small, vocal group who have the support of a number of people in the media who present their arguments in a fashionable way and ignore or make little of the arguments against abortion. It has been apparent in recent events that the media are more often than not inaccurate in their assessment of events. This amendment is essential because in many countries legislation, similar to our Offence Against the Person Act, has been overturned by the courts. In America the Supreme Court, on the grounds of privacy, imposed legal abortion on all its states. In Britain a rape case was used [2052] by the courts to permit abortion. The same thing would happen here if any hard case was brought to the courts. If abortion is allowed then in effect it means abortion on demand. That is what has happened everywhere that abortion has been legalised. In passing this Bill this House will do itself an honour and future generations will thank us for having taken the initiative.;2062102
194;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).;08.03.83;M;Mr. Michael Joe Cosgrave;Fine Gael;It is not my intention to be repetitious. Most speakers have made the important points regarding religious and medical issues. I am availing of this opportunity to put before the House my beliefs regarding the amendment. Having studied all the literature and the cases put forward by the supporters of the pro-life amendment and the anti-amendment lobby, in what has been commonly referred to as the abortion referendum, I have decided to add my voice in support of the pro-life amendment campaign. I support the wording of the proposed amendment to the Constitution as drafted and intended to be submitted to the electorate. However, any replacement wording would not be rejected by me out of hand, but would receive full and adequate consideration. Until a replacement becomes available, I reserve my judgment, but meanwhile I support the existing amendment. After mature consideration I have come to the conclusion that the life of the unborn child or citizen needs to be more adequately enshrined on our laws. How more fully can that be achieved than by embodying the same right in the basic legal document of our State and nation, the Constitution of Ireland, or — as it is commonly known in Irish — Bunreacht na hEireann? It will thus be ensured that no law can be enacted by the Oireachtas which would violate that right without first going to the people for their verdict. It was the men and women in the street and in the field who gave to us this Constitution. It is to them that we must return if we want to change it. If the people of Ireland speak out in this forthcoming referendum in favour of adopting the proposed [2049] amendment, the right to life of the unborn child will be safeguarded in our basic law. It goes without saying that when the 1937 Constitution was adopted even the most far-seeing eye could not have visualised a scenario in which a single voice, let alone a chorus of voices, would be raised here, some four decades later, clamouring for the right to destroy human life itself at its very source. Sad to say, that time has arrived. It is up to us parliamentarians, Members of the Oireachtas, to demonstrate by our laws that we are prepared to defend the human life of those unborn citizens who have, as yet, no voice of their own. There are those who would say that abortion is already unlawful in Ireland and is punishable under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, or any section thereof, as a criminal offence and that this, of itself, affords protection to the unborn. With the present national momentum, however, this limited protection could be easily cast aside, perhaps through a successful action being taken in the courts, by which the same Offences Against the Person Act might be declared unconstitutional on some unforeseen grounds or indeed simply through the lack of enforcement as happened in The Netherlands and elsewhere in the case of anti-abortion laws, and has already happened in Ireland in the case of crime and bigamy. I say to the men and women of Ireland that we must stand up and be counted on this issue. Otherwise future generations would be able to castigate us for our failure to act and speak out, thus allowing our nation to follow the example of and go down the same road as that of our neighbouring island. In England and other countries where abortion has been introduced the roads are strewn with the remains of half-developed bodies, a whole army of would-be citizens. The same could happen in this country if abortion was introduced. We would have the remains of half-developed bodies strewn all over the place. We only have to take a look at the abortion figures in England and Wales for the last year for which statistic are available, 1981, to realise the enormity of its scale [2050]— approximately 128,000 abortions were performed in that year, a figure amounting to over 20 per cent of the birth rate of those two countries. Let us not fool ourselves into thinking that this could not happen in Ireland. We are already setting out in that direction. Let us now say 'no'. This is part genocide and cannot be allowed. On those grounds I reiterate my support for the adoption of the proposed amendment or an alternative amendment providing safeguards. I am quite happy with the present wording. But if a wording is advanced which suits the pro-life people I would be quite happy to support that new wording. However, the amendment, as now worded, suits me and, in the absence of a better one, I would support it.;2062103

I expressed regret that the back-pedalling of the Taoiseach and the Government on the original agreed wording was causing and had caused distress and concern to very many people interested in this amendment. I had hoped at the time that the new wording when introduced by the Government would not only show the Government's undiminished commitment to the amendment itself but would also maintain the strong pro-life character of the original draft. This was not to be and now that the new wording is available we can see that it is negative in character and has lost the strong pro-life commitment of the original. The Taoiseach himself over [773] the weekend admitted that he was less than happy about the commitment he had given to this amendment in the first place. This perhaps explains the watering down of the original draft as is evidenced in the new formula and it confirms my worst fears, publicly expressed some weeks ago, that when the crunch came the Taoiseach and the majority of his party would bend with the liberal wing. I find the new wording totally unacceptable and so I understand do many individuals and groups interested in making this amendment to our Constitution.;2066617

205;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il) . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed) .;24.03.83;M;Mr. Patrick J. Morley;Fianna Fáil;: We are seeking merely to enshrine in the Constitution the protection and right to life of the unborn child, in the recognition that it too from the moment of conception is human life, that the Constitution already gives to the citizen. It is a pity the Government did not adhere to the original formula. The new wording has only added to the divisions and confusion and regrettably the anti-amendment lobby are already claiming the new wording as a victory for themselves. It is difficult to understand the motivation of many people and organisations involved in the anti-amendment campaign. I realise that many so involved are motivated by genuinely felt but nevertheless groundless fears on sectarian and medical grounds, but I fear that there are many involved in the campaign for more sinister and selfish motives. They see in this amendment a formidable if not insurmountable barrier to the introduction of legalised abortion in this country and such a barrier would not be welcomed by them. I totally reject the charge that the Bill is sectarian. This Bill deals with the most basic and fundamental of rights — the right to life itself — from which follow all other rights. It transcends religion, race, class, boundary, culture and is equally important and valid for members of particular religions and people with no religion whatever. I fail to see how a charge [774] of sectarian bias can be sustained. I do not accept that it will in any way interfere with or inhibit current medical practices and procedures in treating any problems, however serious, that may arise in maternity or pregnancy cases. Many eminent medical experts bear out this view. I agree that being anti-amendment is not necessarily being pro-abortion, but I do not think that preoccupation with this aspect of the debate should cloud the need that exists at this time for this amendment in order to protect the life of the unborn child who, not being a citizen, is not so protected in the Constitution as it stands. People say that existing legislation is sufficient and quote the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act but the experience of other countries shows that this is not so. Existing legislation could be declared in a future court to be unconstitutional or could be amended and so leave the unborn vulnerable to assault and this would mean virtually abortion on demand. The wording proposed now would appear to preclude the courts from making such a decision but would still leave the road open to the Legislature to introduce such legislation and so I find it at best a half-hearted measure. I believe the mass of the people valuing human life and concerned for the protection of that life have a democratic right to seek this amendment to our Constitution and the Government have an obligation to respond positively to that demand. The referendum that would be involved is one of the most basic and clearest exercises of the democratic process and I regret that the response of the Government to this demand has been half-hearted and that the decision as to whether abortion should or should not be introduced has not been left solely with the people.;2066619
206;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il) . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed) .;24.03.83;M;Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan;Monetary Reform;: I want to join with other Deputies who have expressed the opinion that this legislation is vital. This is constitutional legislation and I cannot understand the haste. Members of this House should have an opportunity of fully debating every aspect of this vitally important constitutional amendment. I must refer to the grave responsibility that rests on every Member of this Parliament. [775] Each of us has a conscience and we must bear full responsibility in the area of legislating for public morality. We must be concerned about the quality of Irish life that we wish to pass on to those who will come after us. It has been said that we cannot legislate for virtue but that we can legislate for non virtue by way of creating conditions and trends whereby the struggle to be virtuous is rendered very difficult. That is why a Christian cannot escape from the obligation to strive to influence legislation in a Christian direction. To say that the State has no responsibility for public morals is to imply that the State has no duty in the areas of justice, honesty, equality and truth. It is to say that the State is beyond moral judgment. Surely everyone of us here knows that there is a grave responsibility on the part of the State in regard to the whole question of public morality. Abortion is nothing less than murder, but it is a practice that is growing steadily in various parts of the world. We in Ireland have an opportunity to display to the rest of the world our total concern for the protection of the unborn. There are differing opinions among some of the Protestant churches and within the Roman Catholic Church, too, as to when life begins. Let there be no doubt about this. Life begins immediately on conception and it does not end at death. Life is created for all time and nobody has a right to take it away. Any amendment to Article 41 of the Constitution which would deny the right to life of the unborn from the moment of conception would be gravely wrong. I am only putting forward the teachings of the Church to which I belong. If I need guidance on matters of public morality I seek if from those who are qualified to give it. Either the present Attorney General or any other holder of that office would be the last person that I would go to if I needed such guidance. I would reject any law that would permit abortion in cases of rape or of deformity of the unborn or that would deny the equal right to life of both the child and the mother. I was present when discussions were taking place between the Taoiseach and [776] the pro-life people before the last general election. In the course of those discussions I had grave doubts about a Coalition Government introducing a total ban on abortion. That may have been because I know the people concerned, because I know their thinking and because I know some of their backgrounds. For that reason, in the presence of Mr. Brendan Shortall, Dr. Vaughan and the other pro-life people, I asked the Taoiseach, as I held this Bill in my hand, if we could go to the people in the general election in the belief that we were pledging our full support to those who were anxious that this legislation be enacted. The Taoiseach appeared angry that anyone should cast doubts on his sincerity in regard to implementing in full the terms of the Bill. In the agreed Programme for Government between Fine Gael and Labour it was stated that legislation would be introduced to have adopted by 31 March 1983 the pro-life amendment proposed by the outgoing Government. The Labour Party reserve the right to a free vote on this issue. We appreciate their position and we must appreciate also the position of the Minister for Health who, because of the strong feelings he holds in relation to the amendment, refused to handle the Bill with the result that it was passed to the Minister for Justice. I admire the Minister for Health for the stand he took. He showed a certain amount of principle and made it clear that since he did not believe in the Bill he would not handle it. I regret to say that what has been happening in Ireland in recent years is the emergence of too many ventriloquist Deputies. We all know that when the dummy sits on the knee of the ventriloquist he utters only what the ventriloquist wishes him to utter. There is a ray of hope in that we are not all political ventriloquists because the day the country is ruined by political ventriloquists is the day we are doomed. Deputies: : Hear, hear.;2066620

They raise their nostrils at mention of the word, but yet they do not wish this amendment to be written into our laws. They are not prepared to advocate abortion publicly but the story is different when they are behind closed doors. Why not speak one's mind when the country is in need of leadership on the question of public morality. I quote from paragraph 23 of Humanae Vitae which addresses rulers of nations: And so we would like to speak to Rulers of Nations, because to them most of all is committed the responsibility of safeguarding the common good, and they can contribute so much to the preservation of morals. Do not ever allow the morals of your peoples to be undermined. Do not tolerate any legislation which would introduce into the family practices which are opposed to the natural and divine law — for the family is the primary unit in the State. I accept Humanae Vitae wholeheartedly, as do many others. The text of the pro-life Amendment to the Constitution was published in the newspapers of 3 November 1982. The State acknowledges the right of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right of the mother, guarantees in its law to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. The Catholic Episcopal Conference, the Irish Bishops, in a statement on the Bill said: In view of the clear teaching of the Catholic Church— [778] That is the Church that I go to to find out where I should go in regard to public morality as a Member of this House: I do not go to the Attorney General because he is the last person in the world I would select to go to for advice or guidance in that direction. I do not go to Dean Griffin because God knows the North of Ireland has one Paisley and that is enough without another coming down to the South.;2066623

224;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il) . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed) .;24.03.83;M;Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan;Monetary Reform;: Yes. The Catholic Episcopal Conference, in the course of a statement on 3 November 1982, said: In view of the clear teaching of the Catholic Church on the sacredness of human life, the bishops willingly support measures which give to the life of the unborn child, as to every other life, the full protection of the law. While no constitutional provision can of itself, be a full response to the problem of abortion, the text of the proposed amendment does seem to contribute positively to safeguarding the right to life of the unborn and as such it is welcome. In view of that statement, and of my own belief that abortion is wrong, that it is murder and that any country that adopts abortion is adopting degrees of murder I am opposed to abortion. Any country that is prepared to adopt abortion cannot be far away, no less than between 50 or 80 years away from euthanasia. These matters are before us for our serious reflection. Any Bill passed here must acknowledge and protect the right to life of the unborn. I should like to tell the Minister for Justice that if he is going to have the word 'abortion' mentioned in the Constitution he cannot define it properly. How will the Constitution define what is or is not abortion? That is why I believe that the new wording as [780] published in the newspapers is not in accordance with the undertaking given to the pro-life group. It is not in accordance with the statement of 3 November by the Catholic Episcopal Conference and it is not in accordance with the undertaking given by the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald and his colleagues — I was one — to the Pro-Life group before the general election. Any Bill we pass must prevent the introduction of abortion either through the courts or the Oireachtas. How foolish it would be to have an amendment passed which would prevent the Supreme Court from dealing with the question of abortion but would permit Parliament to introduce abortion legislation? What happens in the case of a hung Dáil or if the majority of the elected representatives believe that the murder of the unborn should be legalised? My idea is that only the Irish people, through a referendum, can deal with a problem of this type. This is a serious matter which deals with the vital and important matter of creation. An amendment which does not include an acknowledgment and protection of the right to life of the unborn would be inconsistent with the idea of a positively expressed pro-life amendment as advocated by Fine Gael and many others. Furthermore, no amendment would be proof against a decision of the European Court of Human Rights unless it specified the right to life in positive terms. Those terms should be clearly set out. Fine Gael in their election programme of June 1981 stated: Fine Gael is unalterably opposed to the legalisation of abortion and in Government will initiate a referendum to guarantee the right to life of the unborn child. That could not be clearer and it is something I conducted an election on. It is what I promised the people and what every Member of Fine Gael pledged themselves to in that election. Are they going to welsh on it? Are they going to go back a bit on that pledge? Are they going to bury their heads in the sand? The Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, [781] when he was speaking on 'Today Tonight' on 4 November 1982, said: What we have proposed, and I pressed this very strongly in my Ard Fheis speech, was that it should be literally a pro-life amendment, which would strengthen the protection of life, the life of the unborn, and I was very relieved that the amendment took that form. The Minister for Justice stated that the object is to ensure that what is commonly called legalised abortion does not become a feature of our law and our society against the wishes of the people. He also said it is entirely appropriate that such a basic right as the right to life of the unborn should be mentioned in the Constitution. The reports I read in today's papers contain no mention of the right to life of the unborn. I am waiting for the Minister to announce the proposed wording, although the Taoiseach has confirmed that the newspaper reports are correct. There is no way I will vote in this House for the wording mentioned on the radio broadcasts this morning because it is contrary to my conscience, contrary to my religious beliefs and contrary to the beliefs of the church of which I hope I am a member. That is why I will not vote for this new presentation, the U-turn presentation. When the Attorney-General examined this Bill he told the Fine Gael Party that it was right and that there were no problems in it. What has happened suddenly to change the mind of the Attorney General? He has done a U-turn on this matter. It makes me wonder about the person who can give advice on a subject today and different advice on the same subject another day. What will the position be on many other grave legal problems? Most of us have a legal adviser but what do we do when that adviser changes his advice from day to day? It is a very serious matter.;2066638

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed) .;24.03.83;M;Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan;Monetary Reform;: It is very difficult to know what way I can deal with the advice which has been given to my party, in view of your ruling. Which advice are we to take? The Bill has not changed, and if it was right when the Attorney General first advised on it, what has happened to change his mind? If I had a solicitor who advised me in that way I would fire him. This amendment should be put to the people so that they will be given an opportunity to decide in the right way on the proper wording. We were told that the wording of this amendment could be improved, but I challenge any Member to endeavour to convince me that what has now come forth is an improvement on what was already approved by the churches, including churches other than the Catholic Church. The new wording is not an improvement. It leaves it open to a hung Dáil to pass legislation introducing abortion. How many Members on this side of the House are prepared to take that chance? I am not. I am answerable to the people who elected me whom I promised to safeguard and protect the life of the unborn. I will not welsh or renege on that promise even if I am to be alone. I will stand up to defend the life of the unborn. I do so as a public representative with the grave responsibility of contributing to public morality to the best of my ability as a Member of Parliament. I want this to go on record so that every member of my party will know where I stand. There is no way in which I will vote for the right of a Parliament to introduce abortion. It is all the same to me who brings in the Bill I am only concerned with the principle of the Bill and with safeguarding the life of the unborn. To play politics with an issue of this kind is bringing us to very low depths. I had been hoping that this issue would [783] have been faced up to in a manner in which anyone in favour of abortion would be on one side and anyone against abortion would be on the other. It should be left to the people to decide. Anybody who believes that abortion is a human right should stand on a platform and publicly advocate it. Such a person should not be like a Lanna Machree's dog which went a little bit of the road with everybody but the whole of the road with nobody. That is the way to get the worst of all possible results.;2066644

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed) .;24.03.83;M;Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan;Monetary Reform;: People must have the courage to come out and advocate what they believe in. I firmly believe in the teaching of the Catholic Church on the right to life, when life begins and that there is no end to life. That is the belief I profess every day when I say the creed. I often wonder about the opinions of men in public life who must be disturbed in conscience. It is outstanding to have a clear conscience in public life. I have served my constituents for 40 years. I have never let them down, never betrayed them and never told them untruths. That is how I have been here for 40 years. I will not let them down on this issue. I promised them that I would stand by the right to life of the unborn and I will stand faithful to the end, guided by the Irish Episcopal Conference. I hope and trust I will not be alone in Fine Gael when the chips are down, because we have a grave responsibility for the quality of life in this country. I will not support any form of amendment to Article 41 of Bunreacht na hÉireann which denies the right to life of the unborn from conception. This new proposal does not contain that feature if it permits abortion in instances of rape, deformity of the unborn or denies the equal right to life of the unborn and the mother. The life of the unborn in the eyes of the creator is as important as the life of the mother. We must protect the life of both with no preference either for mother or unborn because one life is the same as the other. It is the protection of [784] life. That is why I feel it is very necessary, apart from political considerations, as a matter of principle, that life, which is the greatest God given right, the right to be born and the right to life, be contained in the amendment. I want, because of the agreement which has been reached to ensure——;2066646

245;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il) . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed) .;24.03.83;M;Mr. Charles J. Haughey;Fianna Fáil;: I must say at the outset that this side of the House are, to say the least of it, astonished at the form of words which the Government have brought forward in substitution for our own. I will very quickly read the words which are in the Bill, a Bill put before the House by the Government and, therefore, presumably supported by the Government and debated on that basis by us all. The wording in the Bill states: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. That is a very clear and positive pro-life amendment. The wording now being suggested to us by the Government and the Taoiseach is: Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion. As far as we are concerned that is totally unacceptable because it is entirely negative. It is not pro-life. In effect, all this states is that the 1861 Act shall not be found unconstitutional by the courts. Everybody in the House should understand that if the amendment proposed by the Government is included in the Constitution, it is no bar to the introduction of legalised abortion into this country. There will be nothing to prevent the Oireachtas, the day after that constitutional amendment is made, repealing the 1861 Act and leaving the whole situation wide open and having no protection whatever for the life of the unborn, having no law whatsoever [786] against legalised abortion. Furthermore, if that amendment is passed there will be nothing to prevent any Oireachtas at any time introducing into the country full legalised abortion on demand. For this simple reason and for many others we find this wording totally inadequate and unacceptable. At this stage, as far as we are concerned, as no better wording than ours has been brought forward by anybody, Fianna Fáil propose to stick with the wording we put forward which is included in the Bill before the House. I must ask the House to consider the position of the Taoiseach in regard to this matter. I want to quote a letter which he signed on 6 November 1982 and sent to Dr. Vaughan of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign. He stated in that letter: I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the statement which was issued as a result of a unanimous decision of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party following the publication of the draft amendment. As you will see we are committed to introducing this amendment in Government and having it put to the people in a referendum before 31 March next. This referendum will not be delayed by any other consideration. This is an integral part of our programme and will be undertaken by any Government that I may have the responsibility of leading after the next General Election. The statement to which he refers is as follows: The Fine Gael Party welcomes the form of the amendment to the Constitution proposed by the Government. The amendment as proposed is worded in positive terms, designed to strengthen the constitutional protection of life, as proposed by the leader of Fine Gael in his Ard Fheis speech. At its meeting today the Fine Gael Party decided to support the amendment and in Government to initiate legislation with a view to a referendum to be held by the end of March next. There are countless quotations I could give which firmly commit the Taoiseach [787] as Leader of the Opposition and as Taoiseach to a pro-life amendment, to including in our Constitution, a positive protection for the unborn. I want to say very solemnly to the House that the Taoiseach is totally reneging on all those commitments and, by putting this amendment forward in substitution for the Fianna Fáil amendment, he is forever destroying his credibility as a political leader. I find it very difficult to understand how the Taoiseach can remain on as leader of Fine Gael and as Taoiseach and at the same time propose this amendment to us as the amendment to be made to the Constitution. It is completely in contradiction of everything he has said, promised and committed himself to. Our time is very limited and I am grateful to you for giving me those few moments. I want to avail of them again to say that Fianna Fáil are totally committed to the pro-life concept, to making an amendment to the Constitution which will positively protect the life of the unborn and ensuring that legalised abortion will not be introduced into this country except at some future date by a decision of the people as a whole by way of referendum.;2066659

260;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il) . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed) .;24.03.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;, Limerick East): We have had a long and thorough debate on this amendment and I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed for the high and generally constructive level of the debate. When I introduced the Bill in this House I spoke of the difficulties in producing a text that would adequately protect the life of the unborn and at the same time not be open to the reservations that have been expressed about the present text. I acknowledged the difficulties the previous Government must have had in producing that text. Everything that has happened since has borne out what I said then. I have considered, in consultation with my colleagues in the Government, many [789] different approaches to an alternative text. At one stage, very recently indeed, I was myself disposed to favour a particular line of approach to the problem, an approach that I thought would be comprehensive while at the same time meeting some at least of the misgivings expressed in relation to the present text. I was authorised to engage in consultations with the various Churches and the Jewish Community on the basis of key words and phrases that would be used in the text and the general structure that might be adopted. May I say, for the record, that I deliberately did not work out a complete text, not only because of the need for flexibility in the consultations but in recognition of the privileges of this House. I cannot give details of these consultations because they were carried out on the basis that they would remain confidential but I think I can say, without any breach of confidence, that there was not sufficient support forthcoming for that approach to make it in any way viable. The outcome was a source of great disappointment to me. I say this now, not to criticise anybody for I know that everybody concerned has acted in good faith and from the best of motives but, at least in large part, because the fact that I had these consultations is now widely known and it would be both unreal and unfair to the House if I did not formally tell the House that they had taken place. It has been said, in support of the existing wording, that it was considered very fully and that consultations had taken place about it with the various Churches. I do not question that. The problem, though, is these statements have tended to be made in a way that suggests that I knew or should have known about the background and that the reservations that I expressed about the present wording were ill-considered and in some way unfair to the Opposition. Again, I want the record to be clear about this. Anybody who listened to or read my opening speech will realise that what I said about the existing wording was very muted. Furthermore it was said, as it had to be, without the benefit of knowing what the former Government had actually done. [790] There were no papers to indicate the nature of the consultations that had taken place before the present text was approved. Neither was there any record of any analysis of the considerations that had led to the adoption of the particular text. May I make it clear that in saying this I am not implying that the previous Government did not have consultations — I know now that they did — and I am not criticising the form that these consultations took, for that was a matter for the then Government to decide and, besides, the consultation may have been carried out in the most effective way. The only point I am making is that I did not have the benefit of any documentation on these issues and that such documentation as was available, while very useful as far as it went, was very limited indeed. In the aftermath of my Second Reading speech there were accusations that the doubts I expressed about certain aspects of the wording were not genuine. That kind of accusation was persisted in to the point that we in Government, and especially my party colleagues who had a commitment to a referendum, felt it necessary to publish the relevant parts of a detailed memorandum of advice from the Attorney General. I would like it to be clear that I am not suggesting that Members of this House are bound to accept the views of the Attorney General or indeed of any legal adviser. Lawyers, even at the very highest level, sometimes differ in their legal opinions. But, to put it at its very lowest, the Attorney General's detailed arguments, both on their own merits and because they came from a lawyer of his standing, must in ordinary prudence be taken very seriously into account by Members of this House, and it goes without saying that they must weigh heavily with members of the Government. If this House were to disregard them, it should at the very least be clearly aware of what it was doing. Having said that much, I do not propose to weary the House with a great amount of detail. There can be no Member of the House who is not aware of the developments over the last 24 hours. The [791] difficulties that we have experienced in securing our objectives can be summarised this way. We felt it necessary to seek an improved wording, something that would meet at least in significant part the criticism made by the Attorney General of the present wording and that would also meet some of the other criticisms that have been made. I personally believe that that was achieveable. But, in the context of a Bill for a referendum, that is not enough. One must also be able to be reasonably satisfied that a particular solution would be likely to command substantial support on Referendum Day. The reactions I got were not sufficiently positive to reassure me on that score. It was against that background that, as is now well known, my parliamentary party colleagues met last evening and discussed a number of options. The decision was that I should indicate to this House that, in view of the difficulties that had arisen, I would propose on Committee Stage a new wording on the following lines: Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion. The first thing I want to say about this text is that its underlying principle is in accord with that underlying the present text. It is aimed at confirming that the Supreme Court cannot declare the present law, or any law, prohibiting abortion to be repugnant to the Constitution and it confirms, by essential implication, that there is not conferred by the Constitution a right to have an abortion. This alternative wording would meet what I think is a main object of the constitutional amendment, that is, that the Constitution as it stands would not be interpreted as meaning that it gives what would amount to a right to have an abortion. The text would also permit the existing law, which is widely regarded as satisfactory, to be maintained. I am not saying of course that this text is not open to be criticised. It does leave open the possibility, however remote that may be, that [792] one day in the distant future the Oireachtas could without reference to the people pass a measure which would permit abortions to be carried out. One answer to that is that those Members of this House who would vote for such a measure would have to face the people at the following general election. The text has the great advantage that, apart from that gap, which in reality is I believe a theoretical rather than a real one, a number of other disadvantages associated with other alternatives are surmounted. It is obvious from what I have just said that I am well aware of the fact that, in so far as the wording I have now mentioned would deal only with the possibility of an adverse court decision, it does not cover all the ground which the existing wording attempted to cover. But it certainly covers, very clearly and without any attendant disadvantages that I can see, the risk which was at the heart of the case made at the outset by PLAC and others. It is, therefore, as I have said, fully in accord with what is proposed in the Bill before the House. Every Deputy who can support such a wording, as well of course as those Deputies who would prefer the existing wording or some variation of it, can, I suggest, fully support the motion before the House that the Bill be given a Second Reading. On that point, I repeat what I said in my opening speech, namely, that approval of the Second Reading is not approval of any specific wording. I therefore commend the motion to the House.;2066674

Cuid II 3º Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate, or to deprive of force or effect, any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion.'. I move amendment No. 1: [2002] In page 4, after line 20, to insert the following Schedule: 'SCHEDULE Part I 3º Ní cead aon ní dá bhfuil sa Bhunreacht seo a agairt chun aon fhoráil de dhlí a chur ó bhail ná a fhágáil gan feidhm ná éifeacht ar an ábhar go dtoirmisceann sí ginmhilleadh. Part II 3º Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate, or to deprive of force or effect, any provision of law on the ground that it prohibits abortion.'. When I spoke at the conclusion of the Second Reading debate, I told the House that a decision had been made by my party that I should introduce this kind of amendment. I gave the reasons then and I do not think that I should delay the House by unnecessary repetition. However, I think it is necessary that a few points should be clarified. The first point concerns the precise wording. In my speech at the conclusion of the Second Reading, I said that the wording would be on the lines of the words I then used. I quite deliberately left open the possibility that some minor change, not altering the sense of what was proposed, could be made before the formal amendment was put down. As it turned out, the Attorney General was quite satisfied that the wording that I had mentioned on Second Reading needed no change whatsoever — that it was entirely adequate to achieve its objective and that the technical criticisms that had been made about the alleged insufficiency of the word 'invalidate' were not well founded. Nevertheless, because the criticisms had been made and were being persisted in, I did not think it right that we in this House should embark on a futile and time-wasting argument about a side-issue and, as the Attorney General was satisfied that a few words could be added without harm to the meaning, the amendment that I am now formally putting to the House includes, [2003] as well as the word 'invalidate', those extra words, that is, the words 'or to deprive of force or effect'. I think I should at this point refer to the statement issued last evening by the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign — PLAC — about the wording that I am proposing. It is unnecessary for me to comment specifically on that statement in so far as it deals with the substance of the proposal, as the general comments that I shall be making are relevant to it. I shall refer, therefore, to the technical criticisms only and, as far as they are concerned, I can sum up my position by saying that I cannot accept them as valid. This amendment would be an integral part of the Constitution. The phraseology that nothing in the Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate certain kinds of laws does not and cannot possibly be held to mean that such laws might indeed be unconstitutional but that no procedure will exist to test the matter. The prohibition on the invocation of the Constitution, being itself a part of the Constitution, clearly is more than a procedural bar — it expresses the intent that such laws are not unconstitutional. This being so, I suggest that there is not the slightest possibility that the Supreme Court could, on a reference of a Bill pursuant to Article 26, take a stance different in this respect from that it would have to take if the Bill had been enacted. To say otherwise is to say that the Supreme Court would give an interpretation contrary not only to the clear intent of the amendment but also to commonsense. As for the reference to the 1922 Constitution, the position is quite simple. The point PLAC make was certainly not overlooked, and I think they might reasonably have assumed that it was not overlooked. The fact is that it is only a purely theoretical point and does not take account of the actual content of the 1922 Constitution. If there is a risk that the 1861 Act could be declared to be inconsistent with the Constitution — by which of course I mean the present Constitution — that risk derives from the fact that there are, in that Constitution, certain [2004] Articles the precise scope of which is as yet undetermined by the courts and that these Articles may, for instance, implicitly recognise a right to privacy which would take precedence over the 1861 Act. There are no corresponding provisions in the 1922 Constitution so the possibility of conflict or inconsistency could not arise in that context. I do not believe that it would be right to clutter up the terms of the present amendment with useless verbiage that has no relevance, given the facts to which I have referred. I would also say that, while I can understand the disappointment of PLAC with recent developments, I would appeal to them not to add further to the difficulties and divisions by criticism which, in its content and tone, goes beyond what could reasonably be justified. I do not object in any way to their saying what they feel they ought to say about substantive points but I would seriously urge them not to seek to make issues about mere technicalities on which there need be no disagreement. Turning now to the substance of the amendment, may I recall that, when referring to it on Second Stage, I adverted to the obvious fact that it does not seek to tie the hands of the Oireachtas, something that had already been noted in the newspapers that morning, in the context of my party's decision to sponsor such an amendment. To my surprise, Deputy Woods subsequently referred to what I said as a 'damaging admission'. I wonder if the Deputy considered the implications of what he was saying. It is my function, as I see it, to put the facts as clearly as I can before the House. To speak, in this context, of my making admissions suggests that, for some unexplained reason, the Deputy thinks I should have come in here and tried to pretend that the amendment is something different from what it is. Not only that but it suggests that, if I had done so, Members of the Dáil might not have noticed that I was misleading them. As I say, I find this kind of comment surprising. However, the point that I would like to make clear, as I formally propose this amendment, is that, when I said that the [2005] text as now proposed would not exclude the possibility of legislation by the Oireachtas, I meant only what I said and no more than that. I am saying only what indeed is obvious, namely, that this text does not exclude that possibility. I am not in any way expressing the view that nothing else in the Constitution is to be interpreted as recognising a right to life before birth. Different people have different views on that question — that is, whether the Constitution already has an implicit recognition of a right to life before birth — and it is sufficient for my purpose to say that there are distinguished legal authorities amongst those who clearly believe that such a right already is recognised in the Constitution. The reason I advert to this now is, I believe, a very important one. It will be common ground that, if such a right was known with certainty to be recognised already, no amendment would be necessary — neither the one sponsored by the Opposition nor the one now proposed not any variation on either of them. It may fairly be asked whether there is another side to this. Granting that there must be a very real possibility — to put it no higher — that the courts would, as matters now stand, find in the Constitution a right to life before birth, might they feel precluded from doing so if this amendment were passed, seeing that the implication of their decision would be that the amendment was unnecessary? In fact, that question has already been effectively answered in the negative, because the provision which is now identified as Article 40. 4.3º of the Constitution, and which concerns habeas corpus, was inserted by way of amendment and, in a case that subsequently arose, the Supreme Court gave a decision which, by implication, showed that the amendment had been unnecessary. It was unnecessary because the substantive part was shown to be already implicit in the Constitution — as part of something wider — and because the procedural part could have been effected by legislation. It follows that the consideration that an amendment would be shown to have been unnecessary would not be regarded by the Supreme Court as something that [2006] would preclude them from finding in the Constitution a right that they would have found in the absence of such an amendment. Accordingly, I suggest that the House can be fully assured that nothing in this amendment can possibly be interpreted as interfering with any existing rights in the Constitution. There remains the important question: what is wrong with the existing wording? Deputies are, of course, already by now well aware of what has been in the public press and of the fact that, on the best legal advice available to us, the existing wording has serious defects. Briefly, those defects are twofold: first, that the expression 'the unborn' is very ambiguous second, that the reference to the equal rights of the mother is insufficient to guarantee that operations necessary to save the live of the mother but resulting in the death of the foetus may continue. On the first point, it is scarcely necessary to say that objection is not being raised simply on the basis that there is a certain degree of ambiguity. Some ambiguity is probably inescapable — language is not a precise instrument. The criticism in this case is the extent of the ambiguity, a criticism which is strengthened by the fact that it was obviously accepted in order to avoid argument. On the second point, I would like the record to show very clearly what is being said by way of criticism — and what is not being said. It is not being said that the wording would be held to make the operations in question unlawful. Nobody could say with certainty what interpretation a court might put on the words. What is being said is that, on the ordinary meaning of words, that should be the interpretation and that therefore there must be a definite risk. Now, the position in which we find ourselves is that I am sponsoring this amendment and, in effect, the Opposition are sponsoring the existing wording. I have sought to answer the questions that arise on my side. If we are to have a reasoned debate, somebody on the Opposition side should, I suggest, undertake to answer the serious questions that arise on their wording. [2007] It has been said that no court, unless absolutely compelled to do so, would put such a construction on the words, given the fact that these operations are in accordance with long-established practice and that it cannot be contended that the courts would be compelled to do so since an interpretation more favourable to the mother is at least an option open to them. My questions are these. First, is it not the case, clearly and beyond any argument, that those particular operations, legitimate and necessary though they are, protect the life of the mother in a manner that in some cases must lead to the death of the foetus and that, in other cases, puts that life at serious risk? Does it not follow that, while the death of the foetus is certainly not intended, in the ordinary meaning of the word 'intended', it is nevertheless a fact that, since the death of the foetus is a foreseen and even certain consequence, the action being taken gives priority to the mother's right to life? Now — and this is the crunch question — if the intention is, as no doubt it is, that these operations are not to be unlawful, why does the draft not say so? Why does the text use language that its sponsors hope will be interpreted in a particular way by the Supreme Court but avoids expressing that intention with the kind of clarity which is attainable? I should like to make it quite clear that I accept that all concerned hope, and indeed may feel confident, that that is the interpretation that the courts would opt for. But the question remains: why does the text not say what its sponsors intend? I do not know what the thinking behind the choice of these words was. The wording was, as we know, chosen by the former Government. I have already explained to the House that the records available to me do not contain any analysis or any background information that would throw light on it. I suggest that it is up to somebody on the Opposition side to clarify it, even if only so that in future years somebody may be able to read the record and find the answer.;2070953

Woods;Fianna Fáil;: There is nothing ambiguous about the word 'unborn'. Even the Minister's own advice seems to have been to that effect. The most likely interpretation which he gave also and which the Attorney General gave in his advices — I have a copy of these also, although I will not suggest how they came out in case I would be in trouble with the Chair. Even the Attorney General says that the most likely interpretation is the one which we have put on it and which any sensible, reasonable juror will put on it. Therefore, the Minister should stop confusing people by asking someone to explain it to him. I am sure it has been explained to him and there is not much doubt about it now. If the Minister takes the Irish version, 'na mbeo gan breith' it is much clearer, takes precedence and nobody, including the Minister, seems to find any fault whatever with it. That is included in part I of the Schedule and is generally accepted as being quite clear. There are no reservations about it and it takes precedence over the English version. With regard to the unborn, the Minister has said that that could be made clearer. It could, by putting in an exact point but this is the reason for having a Constitution, where the general point is quite clear and the detail in relation to it can be discussed in relation to the views of the medical and legal people at the time. The Minister felt that one could put in 'from fertilisation' or 'from conception', and of course one could. That is the generalised nature of the rights which are involved here. It is not necessary to do that and it would be unduly restrictive within the Constitution to take that approach. It is quite clear to all concerned the general point at which life begins and, beyond that, it is a matter for the courts and the general practice, which is quite clear at present. If, in future, [2027] there is any further evidence or information emanating from medical, legal or others in relation to it, it can be considered but within the situation where the unborn clearly have the right to life enshrined in the Constitution. The Minister referred to the equal rights of the mother being insufficient. I have said enough about that. We have had two Attorneys General who agreed on that point and most people are in agreement about it at this stage. I do not think there is any need for the Minister to worry about that point. Therefore, we regard the wording which we have in our amendment as satisfactory. We believe that it will meet the requirements which have been put to us to put a positive pro-life amendment. The amendment of the Minister here is defective in that it does not protect the life of the unborn. It does not provide positive pro-life cover, so to speak, the fundamental right in the Constitution. In that sense, therefore, we believe it should be rejected and we see no difficulty with the original formulation. Before the House also is another amendment which seeks to make the right to life of the unborn subject to the right to life of the mother. Of course, all the rights are equal rights and if we begin to give the unborn a specifically lesser right that would leave the position of the unborn particularly vulnerable. That amendment is included in those put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa and it is No. 3 on the schedule of amendments which was circulated today, 27 April 1983. At this stage we will leave it. That is our position and we are quite prepared to discuss and debate the details within that position in the course of the day.;2070958

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage .;27.04.83;M;Mr. Barry Desmond;The Labour Party;: At the outset let me commend my colleague, the Minister for Justice, for his continued endeavours to bring objective public and political judgment to bear on this grave referendum proposal which was not of his making in the first instance. Let me also support and thank the Attorney General for his unambiguous advice to the Government and the people on the complex constitutional implications of the many propositions which have surfaced on this major question. The public debate which has taken place has proved to be divisive to an extent unprecedented in recent times. It has generated confusion and bitterness, which do not provide a stable basis for decisions as important as changing our Constitution. The only acceptable way of approaching a discussion on the form of words to [2029] be used in a referendum is to clarify that which we seek to achieve. As I understand it, the instigators of this campaign for constitutional change were concerned that legal interpretation could result in the introduction of abortion, against the clear will of the majority of our people. Leaving aside whether such a fear is realistic, that at least is a particular aim. However, there is an incredible reluctance on the part of those same people to accept the clear implications of their favoured amendment. The highest law officers of our country have confirmed for the Government what seems quite likely to the layman: that is that the original form of words proposed by Fianna Fáil would result in most serious uncertainty. The only means of resolving that uncertainty, arising from the clash of two proposed equal rights of the mother and child, is to test it in the courts. As a result, the final decision on whether and in what circumstances the procedures amounting to abortion would be permitted would rest with the Judiciary. Yet this is precisely the result which the campaigners sought originally to avoid. Equally seriously, legal interpretation of this form of cords would resolve the conflict of rights in such a way as to prohibit medical treatment which is currently available for life-threatening conditions. I point out to the House that every year between 300 and 500 ectopic pregnancies occur in Ireland. Surgical intervention which can result in the death of the foetus is necessary in such cases, as it is for treatment of cancer of the womb. More generally, to give two examples only, I wish to draw to the attention of the House the recent statement by the Dean of the School of Medicine in Trinity College that it is a universal feature of medical care that the mother is accorded priority where necessary treatment may harm the foetus. He instanced, for example, the use of antibiotics or treatment for acute leukaemia which might have an adverse effect on the foetus. The risk to the foetus is accepted and treatment is instituted. Similarly, the Master of the Rotunda Hospital has stated that if doctors had to give equal rights to the mother and infant, caesarean sections to save the [2030] live of mothers suffering from high blood pressure and kidney disease could be fatally delayed. I find it very difficult to understand how the very serious implications of this form of words — and I have given only a mere two implications — can be shrugged off by the supporters of the original wording. Such indifference to the threat to the life of so many women is totally incompatible with a pro-life stance. The serious possibility of such an interpretation by the courts cannot be wished away. Above all other considerations this proposed constitutional amendment affects the future well-being of every woman now of child-bearing age in our Republic and of women yet to be born in our State. This almost all male and almost all Catholic Dáil seems by majority determined for the most part to impose its moral values and medical criteria on the women of Ireland for decades to come. Shame on those of us who would do so today. Another important area of uncertainty arising from the original form of words is the position of well-established family planning methods. Of course, this may be an intended result of the amendment in view of the well known hostility of the so called pro-life movement to most forms of contraception. It is of interest to note that since November 1980, successive Ministers of Health, including Deputy Woods, have signed licences permitting the importation into the Republic of over 59 million condoms. One must add to this total the many millions imported without licence. What of the 55,000 women on the pill in this country and the two to three thousand women who use IUDs, the importation of which is illegal? Is it now proposed as a next step in this ultra moral constitutional crusade to prosecute women who use IUDs? We have before us a choice between the Fianna Fail wording and the amendment proposed by the Minister. The wording of the Fianna Fail amendment was precipitously formulated as is obvious when one looks at the files in my Department. Those files also show that Deputy Woods did not make an important contribution to the agreed wording, and in view of the lucidity of his contribution [2031] this morning that could be excused. As Minister for Health I must choose between these two amendments. In that context, and only in that context, the Minister's amendment is preferable because one must accept that it is the intention of the majority of this House, much as it is against my wish, that a referendum be held. I must advise the House, if I have any responsibility as Minister for Health, which alternative is preferable, bad as they both are. I am opposed in principle to the holding of this referendum because I do not believe, and I have spent many months considering this question, that there is a need for or a capacity of true definition of prohibition of abortion being inserted into our Constitution. As one opposed to abortion, I hold the view that the provisions of the 1861 Act adequately meet our needs relating to abortion. If I have to choose between the two alternatives now before us, I accept that the Minister's amendment accomplishes only to a degree the objective originally sought by the so-called pro-life campaign and mitigates the uncertainties and the inducement to litigate which are inherent, and disastrous, in the original wording. Despite this and despite the evidence that the original wording is extraordinarily defective and dangerous to women, the pro-life movement have rejected it and have shifted their ground to what I call the hysterical accusation that the Oireachtas, the representatives elected by the people, would fly in the face of the wishes of the people they represent by introducing legislation to permit abortion. That is the nub of the argument. That is an insult to the Members of the Dáil and it is a diminishing of the traditions of our democracy that such a suggestion be made. It is even more reprehensible that some Members of this House should actively seek to propagate that fear. I deplore the appalling public attacks made by Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan on the Taoiseach. His gross inference in his RTE interview that the Taoiseach was propagating a policy of abortion, of Herodian slaughter of the [2032] innocents, brings deep shame on Dáil Eireann. It is also difficult to avoid the conclusion which can be drawn from Deputy Wood's contribution that the deep feeling of our people on this important issue is being used as a weapon in a party political conflict.;2070965

Woods;Fianna Fáil;: In relation to the Fine Gael wording as proposed here, I have tried to show how this wording is substantially at variance with the principle which was put forward by the proposers of the Bill in the first instance. They will recognise [2025] that, and I appreciate the Minister's sensitivity about that aspect. I believe it is not going to meet the promises and commitments which were given in the first instance. The words which have been put forward by the Government in their amendment are extremely limited and do not represent a pro-life commitment. It has been made quite clear that they could be technically deficient, and in that respect the Minister has made an amendment at a very late stage. However, even that does not merit a great deal of consideration in the House because of the very limited nature of the amendment which the Minister is putting forward. We have been treated to a variation of words and proposals and we have had the Minister's advice and suggestions. He appears to be at variance with his own colleagues and Attorney General in relation to the words which have been chosen. We will be going into further details later regarding the legal, medical and other aspects. From the beginning we have been anxious to have a pro-life amendment which would bring into our Constitution the guarantees to the unborn which we gave an undertaking to do and which we are prepared to continue. We are not anxious to get into argument over minor points. The Minister has asked me to answer some questions in relation to our Bill. He referred to the word 'unborn' being ambiguous. He must be one of the few people in the country who makes that claim. One could say 'the right to life of the unborn life' if the Minister felt it was necessary but most people would say that that is not necessary. I could refer to the Minister's advices which either he or someone else leaked from his Department——;2070966
287;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage .;27.04.83;M;Mr. Tomás Mac Giolla;The Workers' Party;: This is a black day for democracy and will be seen as such in 30 or 40 years' time. I hope, a Cheann Comhairle, that you will not rule me out of order if I touch on things about which I have not had an opportunity to speak [2038] as yet. I would remind you that I was not allowed to speak on Second Stage because of a guillotine. Therefore, there are some comments I should like to make all of which will be relevant, I am sure you will agree, to the referdum which it is proposed to hold. I want to mention the constant references to pro-life in this debate particularly by Deputy Woods. He referred to the pro-life amendment, pro-life people, and said: 'We are pro-life'. I want to declare to this House that I am pro-life and I have been pro-life in many campaigns over a long number of years. I was pro-life in campaigns against the Vietnam War, against other wars, against NATO, against nuclear missiles, against terrorism and against legal executions. I wonder what record of pro-life the so-called pro-life people have, the small fanatical group who began what they called the pro-life campaign. In many cases they are the very people who support legal executions, nuclear weapons, joining NATO, whipping, lashing and hanging. They are the type of people who have moved into politics in the United States in the past five or six years also. They are known as the fundamentalist groups, the Bible thumping fundamentalists who are pushing the United States to the brink of war almost. They dominated the election of Ronald Reagan and they succeeded in having some of the most liberal and progressive representatives in America defeated in the last election. They are aiming to defeat others, including Senator Edward Kennedy, in the next Government. They have become quite a force in American politics. This is the type of group who have been started here, the type of group who are fundamentally fascist in nature and who are attempting to dominate politics in Ireland as this group have dominated politics in America. The final outcome of such domination of political life would be theocracy of the type in Iran under the Ayatollah Khomeini. We can see from what is happining in Iran how pro-life are the religious Government in that country, the daily executions, the cutting off of hands and other dreadful actions in the name of God and religion. This is what [2039] we would be faced with, the type of fanatical theocracy that will be followed by the small group of people who began this campaign of political blackmail on political parties. The Roman Catholic hierarchy were not at any time campaigning for such an amendment but they have been forced into the position of having to back this Fianna Fáil wording which came from God knows where. I want to nail the pro-life suggestion that those who oppose the amendment are anti-life and that those who support it are pro-life. The case is almost the reverse. Many babies who were unborn in 1945 when the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are dying today and have been dying for many years. Therefore, the actions of governments in relation to nuclear weapons and all weapons of war should be as vital a concern to the so-called pro-life people and members on the Fianna Fáil benches who have followed this line. They have attempted to be more religious than the Pope himself, more on the side of the angels than the hierarchy and now sit smugly in this House. One might call them 'Charlie's angels' but if we think back to a few months ago we might remember them as the angels with dirty faces. This is the type of smug hyprocrisy which has led to this amendment being put before the House and which is leading the whole process of parliamentary democracy into the sewers. It is no great credit on the Taoiseach either who has shown such political ineptness and lack of political integrity. On his own admission he went into this at the last election knowing it was wrong but for political purposes he went along with it. He says now he knew at that time he should never have done it but he did it to win an election as though that made it all right. This is not political integrity or courage of the type needed here. People should stand up and say what they believe in, and on this question it is even more vital that people speak out with courage and guts whatever their political future. It is important for the unborn and for the future of the country that we have political integrity and that we give some [2040] meaning and credibility to this House. In 1983 we are supposed to be grown up as a nation. We are not even grown up as individuals in the carry-on we have had in the past three months. We are proving we have not advanced very much since 1951. Fianna Fáil brought forward the amendment two days before they left office. It came from the great republican party. They used to be the republican party in brackets but they became somewhat brave in recent years and took away the brackets. Now they are the republican party without any brackets. What kind of republicanism is it that would bring forward an amendment like this? Would a republican party in the tradition of Wolfe Tone or Davis do that? Fianna Fáil are supposed to be against sectariansim, for democracy and pluralism, for the type of society Wolfe Tone wanted when he gave such tremendous support to the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century, out of which the seeds of republicanism came to Ireland. Republicanism is not just a matter of getting the Brits out. Surely after all these years Fianna Fáil realise that republicanism must be shown as something more than calling the Taoiseach a blueshirt or some ridiculous slogan like that at election times? They must realise it must be proved by their actions in endeavouring to unite the people of the country, in endeavouring to developing a society where there is separation of Church and State, the type of society Tone and Davis wanted. Surely they recognise the fundamental difference between the republicanism of Tone and the Catholic nationalism of Daniel O'Connell who in '98 was actually hunting down the rebels. That type of republicanism is not understood by Fianna Fáil and I should like either Deputy Haughey or Deputy Woods to define for the House what they mean by their republicanism. In bringing forward this amendment to the Constitution, they have abandoned all credibility to their claim to be republican. They have no understanding of the concept of republicanism. We have seen the effect in this House and outside it in the past few months [2041] where confusion and division has been growing. Just imagine how that will be during the course of the campaign throughout the country at the time of a referendum on this amendment. We saw the kind of picket outside this House last Tuesday, when busloads of fanatics came with their posters about the slaughter of the innocents, about Herod and Hitler. This is precisly what will happen during the course of a referendum campaign when high emotional feelings will be built up and when there will be divisions even in families. Meanwhile the world outside just gazes in wonder and laughs at us. They wonder what we are at while the economy is in absolute ruins, when we have the highest unemployment rate in the EEC and growing rapidly, when our finances are in bits and when we are dependent on foreign borrowers. Here we have an amendment to the Constitution which is totally meaningless, of no benefit to anyone, but a grave danger to many women in the future. This is the type of campaign in which people's rights to express their views will be attacked and an endeavour made to suppress them. I do not blame the Fianna Fáil Party for their smugness. All they need do is sit back complacently and look on as the Taoiseach's party are torn apart and the Labour Party go in three or four different directions. They see it as the only possibility of a breakthrough in the electoral scene and will use the electoral and political possibilities of this issue to their utmost to get back into favour on the political scene. The Taoiseach has shown that he is the leader of the people in Government. He is the person that the people look to for leadership. He is the person who should have made some decision a few months ago when he saw the situation. We put down an amendment here months ago to have this matter referred to an all-party committee. Surely the Taoiseach could have seen the difficulties being caused to the country, to himself, to his own party and the other Members and at that time could have referred it to an all-party committe where there could have been discussions and, perhaps, all-party agreement. [2042] So far, in this debate all the speakers in favour of the amendment have confined themselves to condemnation of abortion. They have done so day after day, week after week. If a motion were before this House that it condemns abortion, there would be no problem and the motion would be passed. However, that is not the issue. The issue is a constitutional amendment which is before the House. Surely we should be grown up enough to discuss this in a rational way how it is going to affect us now and in the future what the legal, medical and social implications will be. Let us get information, statistics and so on and examine this question. We have come in here with no background information, just hearing people shouting at us as we come in and we adopt these positions. Our party put down a number of amendments and, true to say, we thought long as to whether we should do so, or just leave the matter as it was. The Workers' Party are totally opposed to any amendment being made to the Constitution on this issue, totally opposed to the Fianna Fáil amendment and also to the Fine Gael amendment. Then why put down amendments ourselves? We put them down as a fall-back — presumably, that is what the Taoiseach did also — to try to avoid the worst elements of the Fianna Fáil amendment and to have a discussion on these so that, at least, the House would be aware of what precisely we are talking about in the Fianna Fáil wording. As a result of the collapse of the Taoiseach's authority in his party, which should result in his resignation, we are coming before this House knowing that the Fianna Fáil amendment will be passed. We put down these amendment for the purpose of discussing the issues. The first was on the question of the life of the unborn. We put down an amendment referring to the unborn human being, to substitute the concept of a human being for that of anything that is living and to allow account to be taken of developing what constitutes a human being, and not to restrict the courts, in construing the text, to a mere concept of life which, in fact, if one considers the wording, could [2043] include animals, or other sub- or prehuman life. There is no definition whatsoever. Unborn what? In the two months in which we heard speaker after speaker on the Fianna Fáil benches, they never told us this. What unborn is it and what affects it? What is perhaps the most serious concern of any responsible elected representative here is the enormity of what this amendment proposes to do. Here, in Ireland, in 1983, in Dáil Éireann, we are proposing to define what no other country at no other time in history had the temerity or audacity to do — we are proposing to define precisely when human life begins and what, in essence, is a human being. If this amendment is passed it will have to be interpreted and that interpretation will mean such a definition. We are proposing to do what medical science, the philosophers and even the theologians have been unable to do. The theologians are finding it as difficult as in the days when they were trying to count the number of angels that would fit on the head of a pin. We are making the decision here. Fair dues to us. We are away ahead of the world at least in one thing. Throughout history, according to what medicine and science have been able to tell us, there have been varying definitions taken as the starting point of life. For instance, at one stage the time of quickening, which was in about the sixteenth week of pregnancy, was the view put forward. At one time some theologians held that the moment when life in the womb became truly human differed between male and female — it took longer for the female to become human than for the male. There is, in fact, no consensus among scientists or theological experts as to when human life begins. Although dogmatic stands have been taken on a definition of human life and taken by the Fianna Fáil benches here as the moment of fertilisation, in practice the more common reference point is taken as the point of implantation in the uterus. In so far as society wishes to express its opposition to abortion in general in an expression of the value of human life, it [2044] is a positive aspiration and certainly one with which no socialist would quarrel. But in so far as this country—specifically this small body of politicians — decides to impose on society a precise definition of the moment of humanity, then we are making ourselves preposterous. There is a view put forward by the advocates of this amendment that human beings exist from the moment of conception. Many people are undoubtedly sincere in this view and have every right to hold it. But there are many other views which are equally unproveable, equally possible, equally valid, that human life begins when the fertilised ovum is implanted in the womb, that human life begins when the brain begins to function many weeks later, or that a human life can be said to exist only from the point of viability. Scientific research may well yield new information which will and must change our views in the future. Meanwhile we are to be burdened with an amendment which will have to be tested in court. The definition passed in court will be ours to live with, whatever the consequences or whatever may be the changes in medical science or anything else. The irony of this amendment is that it might very well affect adversely the very people who want children, who are prepared to go to great lengths to have their own children. Those infertile couples who seek the most modern medical treatment to help them conceive and bear children may well be victims. The word 'unborn' is defined as life from the moment of fertilisation and this could affect the possibility of their having children in the future. The other amendment which we put down was to discuss the issue of the equal right of the mother with the right of the unborn foetus. When the wording of the amendment was first announced many people were reassured that what was being said was after all an expression of the sentiments of the majority of the Irish people, an acknowledgment that we do, on the whole, regard abortion as abhorrent and feel that the child in the womb is a human and entitled to the same rights as other humans. Moreover, the fact that [2045] the amendment referred specifically to the mother's right to life as equal was seen in the beginning as particularly reassuring because we are not very far removed from the days when the moral dictate was that in the case of a conflict at childbirth between the mother's and the child's life, then the child was to be saved. Many a pregnant woman, and many a man watching his wife in labour was haunted by the fear that this impersonal dictate would be carried out without reference to either of the parents' wishes, as was so often the case. There is no doubt that while most Irish people are opposed to abortion they also feel very strongly that the life in the womb, in all justice, cannot possibly have a stronger claim on life than the woman concerned, a woman, who, in very many cases, is responsible for the care of other children. Thus this phrase 'with due regard to the equal right to the life of the mother' was seen in the beginning as an acknowledgment of the woman's claim on her own life, an enshrinement in some way of what we all truly believe. However, this is not the case. A close scrutiny of the phrase itself and the context in which it is set shows that it means practically nothing in real human terms. In fact it may be interpreted in such a way as seriously to jeopardise present medical practice. For instance, the right to life, as defined in the Constitution, is quite distinct from that concept of health which is implied in the Constitution as 'bodily integrity'. This distinction is important for, in terms of the proposed amendment, it seems to mean that the mother's life only, as opposed to her death, shall have equal status with the life of the foetus it does not mean her life of any particular standard of health or well-being. In other words, the risk to the mother — it seems from this amendment — would literally have to be death for her to have any possible constitutional right to interfere with the survival of the foetus. As we know, conflicts of this kind, thankfully, are much rarer today than they were once but there are still today diseases affecting women which require forms of treatment in which such conflict [2046] could arise. The most important of these is cancer, frequently treated with radiation or other drugs designed to kill malignant cells. Obviously they may cause damage to other living cells, particularly those of the foetus. One of the major causes of cancer deaths among women is cancer of the uterus. In one out of four cases this cancer affects the body of the uterus. Hormone treatment of this type of cancer is usually followed by surgery. In this country now the surgical removal of the womb of a woman with cancer is tolerated even when the woman is pregnant on the grounds that the aim of the surgery is to remove the cancerous organ and not to terminate the pregnancy. This was stated specifically by Deputy O'Hanlon when he spoke on Second Stage at column 465, volume 340, of the Official Report, and I quote: Medical ethics are based on the natural law with regard to the equal rights of mother and infant. A doctor would never have to say: 'I will save one life and I will let the other go'. The type of cases which have been mentioned by those who are opposed to the amendment are very rare, for example, where a woman has cancer of the womb. Cancer of the womb in a pregnant woman is a very rare condition. He said that about five times. Where it does occur, if it is necessary for the womb to be removed, it will be removed. If the woman needs radiotherapy, she will have radiotherapy. The fact that there is a pregnancy in the womb does not mean there is an abortion, because there is no intent on the part of the doctor to merely kill the child in the womb. The doctor's intent is to remove the cancerous womb. The same can be said about ectopic pregnancy, a pregnancy outside the womb. Deputy O'Hanlon is there repeating a myth which has been propagated for months that termination of pregnancy in the case of cancer of the womb, or in the case of ectopic pregnancy, is not abortion, in other words that you can have termination of pregnancy which is not abortion. That is a nice type of concept [2047] to relieve the conscience. But when it comes down to legal practice as against medical practice, one is in an entirely different field. The point Deputy O'Hanlon is missing is that it is grand now, there is nothing in the Constitution, nothing in the law, to prevent us from having this ethical, medical practice. Therefore, we can save the life of the mother because we can say to ourselves that it is not really abortion. But if that is put into the Constitution, once it is put into the Constitution, it is taken out of the hands of the medical profession and placed in the hands of the legal profession. It is going to be a lovely day for the legal profession when they get their hands on that. Will they decide on ethical practice, on moral values? Are they even going to make the decisions on the basis of justice? No, they are going to make their decisions on the basis of law. They will make their decisions on the basis of definition — abortion is abortion, termination of a pregnancy is abortion, regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, the law will decide what the medical profession may do and that is precisely what will be the difficulty facing Irish mothers and fathers if this amendment is passed. Recent developments in the treatment of cancer aim to avoid surgery. Medical scientists believe that within a few years we may have a situation in which a woman could be treated effectively by way of drugs and radiation for cancer of the uterus and still retain her womb. In other words, she could have children afterwards. Obviously, if a woman is pregnant at the time the cancer is diagnosed, the problem presents itself: if the womb can be saved by drugs or radiation the decision is whether to abort the unborn and to give to the woman the opportunity of having children in the future. Would that also be a termination of pregnancy that would not be abortion or would it directly be abortion? I am merely mentioning these matters to draw attention to the issues that were not raised when this amendment was put forward glibly, when it was hoped to make abortion the issue and thereby avoid the [2048] issue of the economy. In order to avoid abortion being the issue in the November election, the only reason put forward by Fine Gael for the amendment was that they were walked into it. The question of the protection of mothers or of the protection of future children has not been considered. The situation facing Irish women and their doctors in the event of this amendment being passed may well be the old fashioned surgery that is acceptable, although it involves termination of pregnancy, but with the same risks to the mother and to the unborn. Ectopic pregnancies now represent one in 150 of all pregnancies. Yesterday we were told in answer to a parliamentary question that in 1982 there were 500 ectopic pregnancies. There are complicated moral and legal questions to be asked. At present the treatment of ectopic pregnancies, that is pregnancies occurring within the fallopian tubes, in Irish hospitals is by way of surgical removal of the entire tube. Again, the operation is justified on the grounds that the intention is to provide medical treatment for the damaged organ of the woman with the termination of pregnancy being a secondary effect. Nevertheless it is termination of pregnancy. A new procedure under development would involve sucking out the misplaced embryo, leaving the fallopian tube intact and leaving the woman with the possibility of conceiving again. However, the interpretation of 'unborn' as life existing from the moment of fertilisation might mean that Irish women would be denied the benefits of this improvement in medical science and would be denied the opportunity of ever again conceiving. In terms of the rights of women it would appear that this amendment would mean that only in extreme and rare cases in which a woman's death was a certainty due to her pregnancy, could she present a case for having that pregnancy terminated, not in medicine but in law. Even in that rare instance her rights would be only equal with those of the unborn. I should like to quote from a statement from Archbiship Ryan and which was circulated on Sunday last. The quotation [2049] from the publication, The Archbiship Speaks, is as follows: In the context of the current debate in Ireland, yet another criticism has to be looked at. It is the suggestion that the Catholic Church is so concerned with the life of the unborn child that the life of the mother somehow becomes secondary. This is a calumny, sometimes supported by medical testimony of very doubtful accuracy. It is the clear teaching of the Catholic Church that every human being, born or unborn, has exactly the same right to its God-given life. If a situation should arise which threatens the lives both of a mother and her unborn child, it is the obligation of the doctor and of everyone else involved to do everything which medical science makes possible to save both lives. There can never be a question of 'sacrificing' any one life for another. Is that not an impossible situation for a doctor? This amendment puts the whole matter into the hands of lawyers. In all other cases in which the mother's quality of life or standard of health or risk to life are concerned, it may well be that the right to existence of the tiny embryo would be superior. Is this a just and right principle to enshrine in our Constitution now and for all time regardless of, and even heedless of, medical developments? We have put down an amendment to substitute the words 'subject to' rather than 'equal to' in the Fianna Fáil amendment. This change would give added protection to mothers, a protection to which they are entitled. The rights of mothers have not been considered by the framers of this constitutional amendment. Little thought has been given to its effects, first, on the political life of the country, the divisiveness which it will create and, secondly, on medical practice if the amendment is passed. Let not Fianna Fáil be too smug about this because they might get some dirt on their faces. People are not such fools as to walk into this type of thing with their eyes shut and just blindly follow Charlie. They may get quite a suprise because people are gradually [2050] realising that this is not a vote on abortion and that this is a political issue which is being foisted on them. They are getting more and more confused and coming to the conclusion that it would be far better if this issue was never raised at all, far better for the unborn as well as for the born. After the referendum there may be some surprises when the result is announced. If the referendum is passed the issue then moves into the social field and some of the difficulties in that field were raised by the Minister for Health. It is significant that the Minister for Health said on two or three occasions in the House — it certainly has never been denied — that all the officials in the Department of Health, from the top to the bottom, see the grave difficulties of the amendment and are totally opposed to the Fianna Fail wording because of the problems it will cause.;2070967

Nobody, be it a pressure group, be it church, be it party, will influence my conscience on such a grave matter. Having served in this House since 1969, I am profoundly ashamed of the extent to which Deputies, who privately confess that they are appalled at the implications of the original wording put forward with so little thought by Deputy Woods, and so little analysis by the Government of the day, now succumb to those pressures and create a constitutional impasse. When history comes to be written the files of the Departments will prove my point. As Minister for Health, I am concerned about the future well-being of the women of Ireland——;2070968

290;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage .;27.04.83;M;Mr. Barry Desmond;The Labour Party;: Unfortunately, there are Members of this House who are not averse to that kind of cynical posturing. So long as my views and the views of the people are so firmly committed to the right to life of the unborn — and more particularly of those who are born — there is no possibility that the Oireachtas would introduce legislation to permit abortion. If we pass this amendment into our Constitution we will deny our people the opportunity which may exist in decades to come for legislation to improve and clarify the present legislation outlawing abortion. This House should be as free as possible to frame such legislation in a way that precisely matches the consensus about the circumstances in which medical treatment may have to be given which, as an inevitable consequence as happens at present, may result in the loss of the foetus. The best defence of the right to life of the unborn, as of all other fundamental human rights, is the strength and vitality of our democratic institutions. What we are doing today is diminishing that strength, vitality and public consensus. Constitutional and legal provisions may not alway be enough. The evidence of other countries is that public opinion on this issue is very often stronger than the law or the Constitution. Where public opinion has moved to favour liberalisation of abortion legal sanctions have proved ineffective. It is of critical importance that while our people maintain their opposition to abortion there is no possibility that this House would contemplate defying the wish of the people and we should retain that right in this House. If a referendum is to be held, regrettably, I would favour the Minister's new wording, but only as the lesser of two evils. [2033] This is the whole purpose of reviewing a Bill on Committee Stage when one must choose between the actual alternatives now before the House. I continue to maintain my opposition to the holding of any referendum on this issue. It has proved to be gravely divisive, particularly as it has provoked conflict between the Catholic Church and other denominations on this fundamental issue. It is a sad day for the country and for the moral values of our people that we should witness such a grave impasse in Church-State and inter-denominational relations. Ecumenical progress, so urgently needed on this island, has been seriously damaged by the insistence of a small number of Catholics of extreme views in relation to abortion, contraception, life, and a small group of their supporters within their own hierarchy that their view and theirs alone should prevail over Deputies' in this House and in our Constitution. All of us in this House must deeply regret this development in Irish politics. Though I favour the ministerial amendment — it is basically an amendment derived from Fine Gael deliberations — the Labour Party have a free vote on this issue, and I am speaking in that context. Though I will vote in favour of the ministerial amendment, I will continue on Report and Final Stages, and at the end of the Committee Stage, if we have time to have a vote then, to oppose the holding of a referendum, irrespective of the form of words, because it debases the role of our Constitution as a focus for unity. To provoke deep division, as this debate has done, and to achieve nothing tangible as a result, is to debase our Constitution. The spirit in which constitutional change should take place was best described by the sponsor of our Constitution, Éamon de Valera, when he addressed this House in 1937. He said — in the Official Report, 11 May 1937, column 75: We can, I think, if we only had the will to do it, approach this document in the spirit of its preamble — as it is intended to provide a basis for internal good order, social order, here that it is intended to secure the dignity and [2034] freedom of the individual and that it is intended, finally, to have peace here, to bring about the unity of our country as a whole, and to have accord with other peoples. Primarily, then, the Constitution should be a focus for unity. Again, Eamon de Valera's approach is persuasive — column 66: My anxiety is that we should agree on this fundamental law to the greatest extent possible. That is why it has been introduced in the Dáil for full discussion and for full amendment before it is submitted to the people by way of plebiscite. On this important issue the level of agreement appropriate to our Constitution has not been achieved, or even been sought in any way relevant to our aspirations for unity on this island. Furthermore, on a matter of this kind broad agreement may not ever be possible. Because of the differing views held within the community, not least on denominational lines, it is preferable to retain the flexibility to frame legislation which most nearly approximates to the consensus prevailing at any particular time. Indeed, Eamonn de Valera understood the need for such flexibility. When introducing discussion on his draft Constitution in this House he said of the fundamental human rights provisions — column 62: You cannot state those things absolutely. All you can do is to give the fundamental principles to state them clearly and correctly and leave it to the sense of justice and good will of the community, to work in accordance with the spirit of the declarations. Therefore, I am in reasonable company in opposing the proposed referendum. My opposition to it is also due to the fact that it will have no effect on the Irish women and girls, more than 80 each week, who travel to Britain for abortions. Theirs is the real problem and the real tragedy. The majority of them are unmarried and in many cases they are driven to this terrible step by the pressure they experience on becoming pregnant. That pressure comes from their families, [2035] relatives, neighbours and work-mates, and quite a number of men directly involved. How many of those who advocate an amendment on this issue, on grounds of public morality, would apply the same pressure if a single girl in their own family were to become pregnant? I fear that that would be an all too common response. Just as hypocrisy has driven many Irish girls to the abortion clinics of Britain and elsewhere, I fear that collective hypocrisy is driving us in this House to permit a referendum which will give some the satisfaction of having empty phrases enshrined in our Constitution while thousands continue to travel to Britain and elsewhere for abortions. The reality of the problem of abortion here is such that I cannot support such empty gestures. I deprecate this whole campaign which has provoked such division in the community, threatened the proper role of our Constitution and has obscured the real problem of abortion which cannot be tackled by legal formulae. From sources available to me I am satisfied that there is a good deal of information within the Republic and in the United Kingdom regarding the women from this country having abortions in the United Kingdom. I am asking the Medico-Social Research Board to collate and analyse such information as can be collected or is already available and to report to me on their findings as early as possible. I have, indeed, already been in contact with the board on this important matter which is of such vital public interest and I hope that their report will be with me by the autumn. I would expect that the board's findings will contain important information about the women in question including such matters as geographical and age distributions, occupational, social and marital status, any history of previous abortions and other relevant data. I submit that the former Minister would have been better engaged in that kind of approach than in trying to expound his philosophy here with such consequent confusion. I can assure Dáil Éireann that, as soon [2036] as this vital information becomes available to me, I shall lose no time in informing the House of the findings and of the action I propose to take arising from them. Meanwhile, it is my intention to allocate from the moneys available in the budget for voluntary social service bodies some resources to enable concerned organisations to provide advice and assistance to women who might otherwise contemplate having abortions. Accordingly, I intend to vote in favour of the amendment put forward by the Minister in the context of a free vote within the Labour Party. I want to commend my colleague in the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey. When this matter was first broached to him he was the leader of the Labour Party. I attended a meeting with the sponsors of this campaign where he showed extraordinary perception, courage and directness and did not fall into the trap which——;2070970

In conscience I could not recommend the original wording. That wording is regrettable and dangerous. I will vote for the Minister's amendment and, on Report Stage, I will vote against the holding of a referendum. If a referendum is to be held, as this House seems to be determined, let us at least hold it with the least damage to our country. Let us try to maintain on this island, North and South, between different denominations a sense of national purpose and a sense of respect for one another's views on grave issues such as abortion and moral values. If I were a member of a Northern Ireland denomination other than the denomination whose members are pushing this through, I would not have anything to do with Dáil Éireann for many a decade to come. That is another major tragedy. In Dáil Éireann we must try to ensure that we do not bend to extreme pressures and extreme views on aspects of medical practice. I can find no recommendation or support in any Government Department for the form of words suggested by the Fianna Fáil Party. As a layman I have tried desperately in the past few months to understand the medical issues involved. I am sickened and appalled and I find it obscene that a wording of this nature should be proposed particularly by people who purport to have available to them experience in gynaecology, in obstetrics and in constitutional law. As a layman with no qualifications in those fields I implore Deputies not to go ahead with that wording. I urge those who are determined to ram it through to have second thoughts about it and draw back from putting the future legal interpretation of the right of women and the right of the foetus in danger in a constitutional context.;2070972
293;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage .;27.04.83;M;Dr. Michael J. Woods;Fianna Fáil;: The Minister's speech is very disappointing. He would appear to be passing responsibility for this amendment to this side of the House and asking the questions of us. I would have thought that it was the responsibility of the Minister to express clearly the necessity for a pro-life amendment and, if he is not proceeding with the pro-life amendment, to give us the reason for that change. The Minister has told us that at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate he told the House that a decision had been made by his party that he should introduce this kind of amendment. Again, we are back to the question of the status of the Minister in relation to the amendment he is bringing forward. Is it an amendment on behalf of his party or on behalf of part of that party or of part of that side of the House or is it an amendment of the Government as a whole? I disagree with the Minister on the basic principle. He tells us that at the conclusion of the Second Stage he told us that the wording would be on the lines of the words he used then. He goes on to say that there was some minor technical change introduced but that apart from that the wording is on the lines used by him at the conclusion of his speech. If we take the words that have been presented by the Minister, we find that there is a substantial departure from the principle enunciated by him in the first instance in bringing the Bill to the House. In May 1981 the Taoiseach gave a firm commitment in principle on behalf of his party to a pro-life amendment. One of the first problems we have with the amendment the Minister is putting at this stage is that it is not a pro-life amendment. It is not an amendment of the kind that his Leader promised in the first instance or of the kind that was put before the electorate. Consequently, it is totally deficient in that respect. The Minister would like to have us spend the day debating minor technical points but the first and fundamental element is that he has departed from the principle of the commitment given and from the commitment as contained in the general principle of the Bill and understood at Second Stage. The Taoiseach was the person who was [2009] first to give the commitment in principle. Some weeks later our party Leader gave a similar commitment in principle, that was to introduce a pro-life amendment. There was no political division at that stage on the issue. There was general agreement on the matter up to the election of January 1981. The Coalition were returned to office then and it is interesting to note that during their period in office no progress was made in relation to a pro-life amendment. That situation assumes a new significance as it becomes clear that the Coalition at that time either did not intend to or were not able to get around to introducing the amendment.;2070973

Woods;Fianna Fáil;: The point is that a new amendment is a departure from the principle which was agreed to and put forward by the Leader of Fine Gael. I do not need to stress that, since it is well-known publicly. There is clear evidence that the principle was accepted. The Taoiseach, in one of his statements, referred to the amendment as proposed, which is the amendment included in the Bill, as being defined in positive terms and designed to strenghten the Constitution and protection [2011] of life. In Opposition, and at earlier stages when in Government, the Taoiseach and his party were committed to the underlying principle of a pro-life amendment. The Taoiseach was at great pains to emphasise that fact, a matter which has been dealt with clearly in the media and during the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill. There can be no doubt about the commitment by him to a positive pro-life amendment, such as is contained in the Bill and as was put to the House by the Government. I accept that the Labour Party expressed concern about that amendment but there is no doubt that the Taoiseach unequivocally accepted the principle of the Bill. In fact, the Minister for Justice on Second Stage said: ... in approving of the principle of the Bill, which is what the House does in giving a Bill a Second Reading, Deputies would not as far as I am concerned be committing themselves to the particular wording now proposed or any other particular form of wording ... That statement caused considerable dismay and shock in the House. We were given to understand that when the Minister brought forward an amendment it would be about the basic principle of the pro-life amendment. The amendment put forward by the Minister, without getting into any new technical detail, is not a pro-life amendment. I must be permitted to make this fundamental point before we discuss the minutiae of the amendment. It is because of this difference that so much of the confusion and debate has arisen. Apart from the technical considerations it may be that on examination the Minister's amendment is deficient in that it does not comply with the basic principle put forward. However, there is a wider problem because the basic issue is the integrity of political parties, of the system and the credibility of the Government and the House. We have gone through the various processes, given various undertakings and passed the Second Stage when we understood [2012] the basic principle, but on Committee Stage we are presented with something which is entirely different and does not carry the basic pro-life principle. The original wording, the pro-life amendment, is: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. That wording has been contested on the grounds that it represents an interference on the part of the State. All societies have their systems of values and they are reflected in constitutional framework. That is relevant in regard to what the Minister has said about the wording of the Bill. He has put fundamental questions about whether we should have a Constitution and what we should have in such a Constitution. I contend that every society has its system of values and in a democratic society they are reflected in a constitutional framework and in the laws. It may be difficult to define the boundary lines between the religious-moral issues and issues which are both secular and moral. That is one of the aspects of these amendments which has received considerable attention publicly. Even if those issues overlap, the State is not absolved from regulating the social order or from protecting fundamental rights. The Minister has put one of those questions in regard to the amendment, what is the position of the State in relation to protecting fundamental rights. Irrespective of any person's private religious views it cannot be denied that the killing of the unborn is an issue which fundamentally affects the secular and social order of the State. That is something which is fundamental to the order of our State and which we believe should be properly covered in the Constitution. I should like to refer to a document which was issued recently in Germany, Comparative Constitutional Law by Professor Walter Murphy, published by Princeton University entitled, Human Dignity and Public Health, Morals, and [2013] Safety. That publication deals with the rights of the unborn and the duty of the State. It deals with an Abortion Reform Law Case in the West German Constitutional Court and states: The Basic Law protects as an independent value the life which is developing in the mother's body. The State's duty of protection is far-reaching. Of course, direct State interference in a developing life is outlawed even further, the State must protect and promote this life, above all, defend it from unlawful interference by other persons ... human life is, as needs little proof, among the highest values in the Basic Law's order. It is the vital basis of human dignity and the precondition of all other basic rights. But because the foetus is an autonomous human being, under protection of the Constitution, termination of pregnancy has a social dimension which opens it to public regulation and demands regulation. Of course, the Basic Law also acknowledges and protects a woman's right to free development of her personality, which includes a general liberty of action and thereby also freedom to decide against parenthood ... But this right is not guaranteed without limitation. The rights of others, the constitutional order and the moral code all restrict it. The rights of a woman can never allow interference in the protected legal sphere of others without legitimizing reason, or permit destruction of life itself, especially if there exists by nature a special responsibility for this life. A compromise which guarantees both protection of the foetus as well as freedom of abortion to the pregnant woman is impossible because termination of pregnancy always means destruction of unborn life. The State must, in principle, act in accordance with the mother's duty to carry out the pregnancy in principle it must outlaw termination of pregnancy. This disapproval must be clearly expressed in the legal order. The false [2014] impression must be avoided that termination of pregnancy is something like a visit to a doctor to cure an illness, or even a legal alternative to birth control. Neither can the State dismiss its responsibility by acknowledging 'a law-free State' and, refraining from upholding values, leave them to autonomous individual decisions. It goes on to state: Certainly, the legislator has the primary constitutional duty to protect developing life. Nevertheless, the Federal constitutional Court also has a constitutionally imposed responsibility to determine whether the legislator has fulfilled this duty. The Court, of course, must carefully allow latitude. ... The Court must not put itself in the legislator's place. Nevertheless, the Court has a duty to decide whether the legislator has done what is necessary, within the realm of the possible, to protect endangered values. This is basically what is achieved by the original Fianna Fáil pro-life amendment and the words 'as far as practicable' are included. The Minister asked for some relevant references and this is one which he might wish to study further. Given that all sections of the community are opposed to indiscriminate abortion, it is not surprising that everybody supports this basic amendment. At least, they supported it before the election but now we have a difference of opinion. I now go on to the wording used in the Fianna Fáil amendment. It is interesting to consider the point at which it is to be introduced into the Constitution. The text of the Fianna Fáil amendment contained in the Bill reintroduced by the Government is as follows: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. Similar words are used elsewhere in the Constitution. Article 40. 3.1º states: [2015] The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen. What is so wrong with this language when it is applied to the life of the unborn? Article 40. 3.2º states: The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen. The amendment contained in the Bill would become Article 40. 3.3º and would state as follows: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. Article 40. 4.1º states: No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law. It is necessary to see the amendment in the context in which it will appear in the Constitution. We can see that the words used are similar to those already used in the Constitution. It is important to note that the Constitution already contains the same guarantees and protection for many fundamental and personal rights of the citizen, including the right to life. This form of guarantee has existed in the Constitution for over 40 years. Although expressed in general terms it has never been seriously challenged as being uncertain, yet this allegation is made about the proposed amendment. The Constitution has been successfully invoked by citizens on numerous occasions to defend their fundamental and personal rights from attack by the State and it has been found by the courts that there is constitutional protection for many personal rights such as the right to bodily integrity, the right to work, the right to marital privacy and the [2016] right to freedom from inhuman treatment. If this constitutional protection can be invoked so successfully and in such a practical way to defend the rights of citizens, then it is difficult to understand why some people object when it is sought to extend the same protection and dignity to the life of the unborn child. The extension of constitutional protection of the right to life of the unborn reflects the place we give in our society to that right while at the same time recognising the right to life of the mother. It is well established in the courts that none of the personal rights of the citizen is absolute or unlimited. The Fianna Fáil proposal does not create absolute or unlimited guarantees for the life of the unborn. Such rights are general and fundamental but they are not absolute rights. The proposed amendment specifically acknowledges the equal right to life of the mother, and the laws of the State may therefore provide for the exercise of that right when it is threatened. There is specific provision for this. In the present circumstances the right to life of the mother is clear and it is certain that it must be protected. The Constitution supports the concept that a mother in a life-threatening position must be given the medical treatment required. A mother will continue to have a constitutional right to life and if her life is threatened by illness she is constitutionally entitled to appropriate medical treatment, even if such treatment would result in the termination of her pregnancy. This is also the position in statute law and the amendment would not alter existing legislation or the medical practice which is in accord with it. The Taoiseach recently raised the scare that medical practitioners would not be able to give the treatment necessary in life-threatening situations if this amendment were made. We have available to us the best legal advice and it has been consistent over a long period. That is why I made reference to the length of time over which this issue has been before us. It is quite clear that rights at present guaranteed in the Constitution would continue to apply following the amendment to the Constitution. Mothers need [2017] have no fear that there would by any change in the position because their fundamental rights are already included in the Constitution. Those rights would still obtain. The advice we have had has been consistent despite renewed referrals on our part from time to time. It is also the advice given by many people outside the House who are interested in this. We have the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign, the lawyers associated with it and the statement by the university professors of obstetrics and gynaecology. Five eminent professors on 15 April said: We have read with astonishment the statement by the Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, to the effect that the original wording for the Constitutional amendment would probably 'condemn to death' women whose lives are now saved by operations which have been performed within the law for more than a century in Ireland and in the United Kingdom. They also stated: Dr. FitzGerald has also cast doubt on the legality of existing well-established medical practice.;2070988

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage .;27.04.83;M;Mr. Frank Cluskey;The Labour Party;: I have been a long time in public life and I have never entered a discussion with less enthusiasm or a feeling of greater sadness than I do on this occasion. I believe that what the House is engaged in today, and what would appear to be the inevitable outcome of today's proceedings, will drag Irish society back decades, not because of any great clamour by the Irish people but because of what I can only describe as a combination of political opportunism and moral cowardice on behalf of the majority of politicians in the House. I honestly believe that they will regret this and that Irish society will pay dearly for those motivations that led them to give in to political and moral blackmail by a relatively small number of people. As the Minister for Health said this morning, I met the people who describe themselves as pro-life. I met them on behalf of the Labour Party when I was leader of that party. I was accompanied by the Minister for Health who was then Whip of the Labour Party. That was when they first started this campaign. The fact that they called themselves 'pro-life' was an indication to me of the way the campaign was going to develop, because the deliberate implication in that title was that those who were against them were against life, were anti-life. The name they gave themselves was the start of their political moral blackmail which has been so successful but for which we will all pay dearly. Unlike some Members I have never purported to be a religious person. Some Members have made their political careers out of being professional Catholics, [2052] But I have religious beliefs, and very strong beliefs, with regard to abortion for a number of reasons. I am against abortion. I believe there is sanctity in human life, that it derives from God and that God alone has the right to take it wilfully. That is a basic belief I have always held and still hold. However, we are not talking about abortion or whether we will or will not legalise it. We are talking about a different issue. I will oppose any amendment being enshrined in the Constitution. I am opposed to it in principle and everything that has happened since it was first mooted has confirmed my belief in the wisdom of the decision I made at the outset: that I would not give tham an undertaking, that I would not be subject to or allow the Labour Party which I was leading to be subject to that kind of blackmail. I recognise, and I did then, that a lot of people are just political band waggoning on this issue. Can any person say on an issue such as this, which has caused many difficulties of conscience to some Members that every Fianna Fáil Deputy believes in this approach? Members of that party have not been allowed to exercise their conscience and one can only conclude that from that side of the House purely political advantage has taken precedence over everything else on an issue such as this. As far as this side of the House is concerned, a number of Members have shown the moral cowardice that has brought us to this point, and we will all regret that. When I met the pro-life people I told them that I have always been pro-life and that the Labour Party were opposed to abortion. I asked those people one or two questions. I said to them: 'You are talking about pro-life, the sanctity of life and I would like to know if you would be in favour, for instance, of a prohibition on capital punishment being enshrined in the Constitution'. No, they were not. Progress reported Committee to sit again. Sitting suspended at 1. 30 p. m. and resumed at 2. 30 p. m.[2053];2070995

317;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage .;27.04.83;M;Dr. Michael J. Woods;Fianna Fáil;: I gave the reference. It is the statement by university professors of obstetrics and gynaecology of 15 April. It has been fairly widely distributed. I believe all Deputies have received a copy. The statement continued: Doctors do not act on crude assumptions about the legality of their actions. Dr. FitzGerald's assertions will be a source of much unnecessary alarm. We have found the original wording proposed for the amendment to be entirely satisfactory. We believe that this wording would present us with no difficulties in the proper discharge of our professional responsibilities. This is signed by John Bonner, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Eamon de Valera, Professor of Obstetrics and [2018] Gynaecology, University College, Dublin, David Jenkins, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College, Cork, Kieran O'Driscoll, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College, Dublin and Eamon O'Dwyer, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College, Galway. What I have said is really the basic legal interpretation of the constitutional right as we are advised and which is quite clear in very practical terms and has been the practice here for many years past. Not only can we rely on our own practical judgment, on the volume of legal and medical advice which we have had available to us in this situation, but we also have a flood of distinguished and imminent lawyers as well as gynaecologists and obstetricians coming out quite horrified at the suggestion which the Taoiseach made and I am sure quite horrified that the Minister should come back and reiterate those sentiments again today on Committee Stage. I hope it is quite clear that the mother's right will still be as it is at present, that nothing in the amendment in the Bill will alter that position, and that her right at present derives from her fundamental right to receive the treatment which she requires in a life threatening situation. In addition to all this both Attorneys General who served in the last Fianna Fail administration concluded that our proposal is adequate and effective to protect the life of the unborn and at the same time the right to life of the mother. The Fianna Fail wording leaves totally intact the right to life of the mother. As far as we are concerned, the question is quite clear and we are quite happy with that aspect of it. As far as the pro-life movement are concerned — a movement of very responsible people who have taken a responsible interest at a time when they saw there could be a creeping development of a movement towards abortion in the country — they are also quite satisfied with the wording we have in this respect as well as in other respects. Various other questions have been raised about the right to life of the unborn. It is interesting that virtually all [2019] groups wanted a positive formulation of an amendment. The pro-life groups wanted specifically to acknowledge the right to life of the unborn. The Protestant Churches were particularly anxious, as we found when we were preparing our wording, that negative prohibitions should not be written into the Constitution. The Minister at the moment is proposing negative prohibitions. What he is proposing has limitations in its own way. The Standing Committee of the Church of Ireland in a Resolution of 21 June 1982 stated: We cannot emphasise too strongly the right to life and this includes the right to life of the yet unborn. If we go on to the question with due regard to 'the equal right to life of the mother' the reference to that equal right to life is the right to life of the mother, the same as the right to life of all citizens is an equal right. It was to quell any fears expressed in certain quarters that the right to life of the unborn might be given precedence over the right to life of the mother that that was included in the amendment. The Church of Ireland in a statement of 16 November 1982 said: In particular, we are relieved that the proposed wording of the amendment acknowledges the right to the the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother. The Taoiseach and the Attorney General have sought to suggest that a phrase put in specifically to spell out the protection enjoyed by the mother could remove that protection and somehow condemn her to death by disallowing certain long established medical practices. This, as I have tried to point out, is not the case. We have seen that the unanimous opinion of the senior gynaecologists supports us in that respect. It has also been pointed out that the wording in no way obliges the Supreme Court to take a perverse interpretation of the wording. The qualification as far as practicable is important in this respect. This is why the wording, as far as practicable, has been included. [2020] It now appears that the Leader of Fine Gael, the Taoiseach, is in open conflict with the Catholic Church, certainly with some members of it, in respect of the claim he has been making. In The Cork Examiner of 26 April 1983 the Bishop of Kerry said: The mere suggestion conjures up an image of the law which it is impossible to accept. What is being suggested is that, once an amendment of the above type had been passed, the law would be bound to invade the doctor's surgery and restrain him from carrying out life-saving operations which have been standard medical practice all over the world for more than a century. One cannot credit that the law has no access to sound principles which would relieve it of the obligation to do anything of the kind. Dr. Ryan, the Archbishop of Dublin, has likewise described the argument by the Taoiseach as a calumny. The position of the Protestant Churches in relation to our wording has been called into question as well.;2070997

Woods;Fianna Fáil;: The position of the Protestant Churches in relation to the wording has been called into question. Archbishop McAdoo in The Irish Times on 4 November 1982 said: 'The proposal seems just and adequate.' Archbishop Armstrong, the Archbishop of Armagh in an RTE interview on 3 April 1983, commenting on the original draft said: We accepted it in the beginning and we were very pleased. As we said in the statement, in both cases the [2021] Government approached the Church of Ireland to ask for their opinions in the matter and they gave their opinions. It is only an attempt and does not go the whole way. It was accepted by us at the time as an attempt to deal with the difficult moral problems. I do not change my opinion from the time it was submitted to us by the previous Government. In their statement of 16 November 1982 the standing committee of the Church of Ireland while repeating certain previously expressed reservations said: Having now studied the text of the proposed Eight Amendment to the Constitution the Standing Committee values the following observations: (1) We recognise that an attempt has been made to take account of the complexity of the subject and the views expressed by our own and other churches, and (2) We are relieved that the proposed wording of the amendment acknowledges the right to life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother. The amendment proposed by Fine Gael would not protect the constitutional right to life of the mother against attack by any future legislation which sought to prohibit abortion in all circumstances even when the life of the mother was at risk. This is a defect which could be important in the future. Such legislation could not be declared unconstitutional on the grounds that it ignored a mother's right to life because the Fine Gael wording provides that nothing in the Constitution may be invoked to invalidate any law which probibits abortion. Some people have claimed that the proposal to amend the Constitution is sectarian. The Minister has made it quite clear that he does not regard it as sectarian. We shall see as the day progresses if that is still his view. As far as we are concerned, it is not sectarian. Virtually all sections of the community and all churches accept the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which is understood to [2022] render the procurement of abortion unlawful except where the life of the mother is at risk. The proposed Fianna Fail amendment will not alter the present statute law or make it more restrictive. It will simply ensure that abortion on demand cannot be introduced without consultation with the people through a referendum. The Church of Ireland has not described the proposal as sectarian. As far as we are concerned, in providing these guarantees which are not absolute, the proposal extends to the life of the unborn in a very positive way the same protection which exists in the Constitution for other fundamental rights. There is nothing inherent in the right to life of the unborn and the value which society places on it which makes it less worthy as an object of constitutional protection than many of the other rights recognised in our democrary. The Coalition proposal does not acknowledge the right to life of the unborn let alone provide for its protection. Their policy is to reserve for the Oireachtas the right to leglislate for abortion in the future. As the Minister said at the outset, it is reasonable to criticise this amendment for what it does not contain. He looked for support on some technical improvements he has made. It is true that the amendment does not go far enough. It does not provide protection for the unborn child and it is on this basis that we feel that it is deficient. One of the reasons we have rights and freedoms written into the Constitution is to protect them from attack by the State. The courts are the independent upholders of the Constitution and can strike down any laws which make such an attack. A former President and Chief Justice, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, once said when referring to the guarantees of fundamental rights in the Constitution that such guarantees are not political shibboleths but provide a positive protection for the citizen. The amendment before the House fails to give any positive protection against abortion being introduced by law in the future without any reference to the people. It does not acknowledge the right to life of the unborn nor does it seek to [2023] protect that life in the future. We may ask what value it expresses in our Constitution other than bringing a negative prohibition into it. What right does it seek to protect in the Constitution? It is a negation of a pro-life amendment. The amendment before us seeks to copperfasten the right of the Oireachtas to introduce abortion without consulting the people. It will also curtail the functions of one of the institutions of the State, that is the courts, and prevent them from passing judgment on whether the Oireachtas has acted in accordance with the wishes of the people. It sets a dangerous precedent by undermining one of the institutions of State and fails to recognise that we are a constitutional democracy and not merely a parliamentary one. Those in the pro-life movement do not want to restrain the Supreme Court in their activities but seek to have a positive statement in our Constitution of the values we hold so important so that it will be there as a guide to the courts. The Minister's amendment placing a stricture on the courts would be most unusual in relation to the Constitution. It has been suggested by those in the anti-amendment campaign that the Constitution already contains a protection of the right to life of the unborn and that, therefore, there is no need for the amendment.;2071001

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Frank Cluskey;The Labour Party;: Before Question Time I was describing the interview I had at the start of this campaign with a delegation of people who call themselves pro-life. I explained to the House that, having told them the Labour Party were very definitely pro-life, I asked them if they would consider a constitutional change on the matter of capital punishment. They showed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for that change in the Constitution. I then mentioned the question of the large number of women and girls who leave this country in order to secure abortions. I agreed with them that this was a very tragic situation. I queried whether any change, such as the one they were seeking to make in the Constitution, would have any effect whatsoever on the number of women and girls leaving the country seeking abortions. I asked them if they would consider campaigning for some changes in social attitudes and other matters such as comprehensive family planning provisions and proper sex education properly supervised in our schools. I did not suggest for one moment that this would eliminate the number of women and girls seeking abortions but that, in my opinion, it would have a significant impact on those numbers. They [2151] showed no enthusiasm for that approach either. They were single-minded. They wanted one thing, a constitutional amendment in relation to abortion. I told them — and I am extremely glad and proud that I told them — I was not prepared to give that kind of commitment on behalf of the Labour Party. It would have been very good if other politicians had taken the same attitude. I greatly fear the consequences on Irish society of what seems to be inevitable — the decision this House will take today. It will take us back to the thirties and forties. We have seen some very disedifying stuff in the course of this campaign. Unfortunately in my opinion we have just seen the trailer. I have two reasons for opposing any amendment to the Constitution along these lines. The first is one of principle. It is wrong. It is sectarian in its approach and, more important, it is seen by members of the minority churches as sectarian. It has put a considerable strain on the relationship between church and State. That may be no harm in some cases, but of very significant harm is the fact that it has put back the relationship between the churches for a considerable time. We have not seen the end of that process either. We have had differences of opinion between the medical profession with some for and some against, and with this opinion and that opinion, and the same in the legal profession. As one eminent Irishman said, in some cases it has turned members of the same family against one another.;2071285

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Frank Cluskey;The Labour Party;: I can appreciate the frantic attempts to stop me from saying some of the things I have been saying about the Deputy's party, but that will not deter me. I was talking about the number of amendments before the House. This morning Deputy Mac Giolla spoke about the position of the Labour Party with regard to the amendments and I was trying to clarify that for the Deputy. I can appreciate the difficulty for any Deputy in this House, but more particularly for people outside the House, who are confused on this issue and the stance taken by parties and individual Deputies. I am extremely confused by the attitude of The Workers' Party on this matter. I thought Deputy Mac Giolla made a very good speech this morning in relation to the confusion that would exist with regard to the law as it now operates under the 1861 [2155] Act if any of these amendments are enshrined in the Constitution. I thought he made an extremely good case, but he kept saying he was totally opposed to any amendment to the Constitution. However, although that party are opposed in principle they have submitted amendments, and I find that a little confusing. I find it smacking a little of political opportunism which, regrettably, has been the main feature of this whole sad and sorry affair. It is regrettable that Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa at the last moment, out of an apparent sense of panic, have tried to grab some of that action. When this whole matter is viewed in retrospect in a calmer light I do not think there will be any glory, benefit or credit in that approach. I have spoken to many people, particularly young people, with regard to this matter. I accept that there is a considerable amount of confusion, but where there is a knowledge of what is going on, where young people have been able to tease out the implications of what is going on, the vast majority have seen the campaign for what it is and have rejected it. I said I had two reasons for opposing an amendment to the Constitution. First, I oppose it in principle because I think it is sectarian and divisive and will do incredible damage to Irish society. Secondly, no matter which amendment ends up enshrined in the Constitution, it will have one of two effects. Either it will increase the risk to the expectant mother or it will increase the risk to the unborn child. As it stands the law is adequate and the proof of that is that literally thousands of women who are resident citizens of this country go elsewhere to seek abortions. They do that because the present law is so effective that abortions cannot be obtained here. One of the most regrettable features of this whole affair is the attitude we adopt on other major social issues, such as the two I mentioned to the so-called pro-life group which might have an effect on the number of girls or women who find themselves having to seek abortions. People talk with contempt of these women and [2156] girls who seek abortions. I wonder if they ever look at it from another point of view, of sometimes very young and inexperienced girls who find themselves in this situation in a society like ours which unfortunately is once again proving itself to be so unChristian in its attitude, approach and understanding. Do they ever get a mental picture of a poor unfortunate woman finding herself in such circumstances, filled with fear of her fellow Christians and their attitude? I am totally opposed to abortion but, at the same time, if we are so quick to condemn it is a great pity we are not a little quicker to help and understand. In this House there are rules that must be obeyed and some restraint has to be exercised by virtue of the rules of the House and the Chair's guidance over the affairs of the House. We have received some indication of how this debate will develop. Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan has insulted a leading churchman, Dean Griffin, a man whom I have known for years and who is a truly concerned Christian gentleman. We have had that happening inside the House and can we imagine, for one moment, what will be said at the after-Mass meetings and at the hustings? What way will this campaign develop once this thing is passed tonight, which apparently it will be, and what damage will it do to Irish society?;2071314

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Frank Cluskey;The Labour Party;: The Deputy has had his head down so much during this whole debate that I am not surprised that he might have thought he discovered something. He might discover a lot more before this thing is finished. That is what I fear about this. The argument has been put — and there is a justification for it — that The Workers' Party have put in amendments as a fall-back decision. Another speaker described it as the lesser of two evils. I have only one attitude towards something which I recognise as evil — I oppose it. I want to make this clear. I am not speculating, I know there are Members of this House who have genuine conscientious objections, who have genuinely sat up at night and worried themselves sick trying to arrive at the proper judgment according to their consciences on this issue. I might not agree with the conclusions they reach, but I respect them for them. I am not speaking about people who have tried to make a professional career out of it, but genuine people, not necessarily in agreement with me. I find it extremely difficult to accept the attitude of Fianna Fáil on this issue. Even at this late stage I appeal to Members on all sides not to let any amendment on this issue go through this House, not to create a situation — which I believe to be inevitable — in which this campaign, if any amendment is passed, pulls out into the streets and into every parish, village, town and city. It will be the most divisive thing that we have seen in this country since the thirties. This House is not at the people's demand or insistence, except for a small fanatical group, to inflict this amendment on Irish society. I appeal to Deputies on all sides not to do that. We will all regret it.;2071322
368;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Dr. Rory O'Hanlon;Fianna Fáil;: I have listened at length to Deputy Cluskey who talked about moral cowardice and about how Irish society is going to pay for this amendment. He did not explain in any way how society is going to pay for it. He stated that this amendment is not about abortion, [2158] that it is a political issue. This amendment is about abortion, that is the reality of it. It is about the politics of how abortion, if it is ever to be introduced here, will be introduced. Like many other speakers I am disappointed at the political nature of the debate over the last few months. It has been an extraordinary debate. However, it is only right that the blame should be laid where it belongs, and that is on the shoulders of the Taoiseach. Last November the Taoiseach was absolutely clear where he stood on the issue in numerous pronouncements, one of which was, in referring to the original wording of the Bill circulated: 'I think it is the best Amendment we can get and it seems sensible to say so in these circumstances.' He also stated: What we had proposed and I pressed this very strongly in my Ard-Fheis speech, was that it should be literally a pro-life amendment which would strengthen the protection of life, the life of the unborn, and I was very relieved the amendment took that form. I feared it might take the other form and when we examined it carefully and saw the wording of it and took advice on it, it seemed to us that it was about as good a formula as you could get. I have to admit that in the Government's favour. The Taoiseach said that last November. The reason for the debate developing so unsatisfactorily is that he did a U-turn on his thinking on this issue. The Bill which was circulated in November was circulated again to this House by the present Government as their Bill in the last days of January of this year. Why was the Bill circulated then when there were these doubts about it? The Government had then been in power for six weeks and if they began to have doubts about the wording in this Bill I cannot understand why they circulated it to this House in January as their Bill. That is where the blame lies for the nature of the debate which is taking place. On 16 February, selective passages from advice given by the Attorney General [2159] to the Government were published in The Irish Times. Why was not all the text given to The Irish Times for publication? That would have been a valuable contribution to this debate. I listened this morning to the Minister for Health. In all honesty, I was appalled at what I believe is an abuse of his ministerial position in some of the comments which he made and, indeed, in some comments which he is reported to have made about the risk to women's lives if this amendment goes through. One would particularly expect the Minister for Health to be conscious of the damage which he can do to Irish women of the child-bearing age by making comments, which are totally without foundation and for which there is absolutely no basis, that if this amendment goes through, women will be condemned to death. The Taoiseach made similar comments and I will come to them later. This morning, the Minister for Health stated very seriously that legal interpretation of this form of wording would resolve the conflict of rights in such a way as to prohibit medical treatment which is currently available for life-threatening conditions. That is totally false. If our wording is written into the Constitution by way of an amendment, it will have absolutely no effect on the law as it stands at present. The 1861 Act will still be the law. He stated that every year between 300 and 500 ectopic pregnancies occur in Ireland. I consider those figures too high, based on the information available, but the number is not important. What is important is to give the impression to anybody that if there is an ectopic pregnancy present, in other words, if there is a pregnancy in the fallopian tubes, because of this amendment, or because of a change in the Constitution, a woman's life would be put at risk. The treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is to remove the tube containing the pregnancy. Some of my very eminent obstetrical colleagues inform me that at operation they have never seen a live foetus in the tube when they removed it. I cannot understand how the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health or anybody else who talks [2160] about it would expect that somebody might go to the court, to the High Court or Supreme Court to ask that a woman be allowed to continue her pregnancy, if there was a pregnancy in the fallopian tube, because it is not compatible with life. No court would give a decision that would kill the mother, first of all, also knowing the fact that the pregnancy in the tube was not compatible with life. The Minister for Health this morning quoted the Dean of the School of Medicine in Trinity College about medical care for the mother, that is, that it is a universal feature of medical care that the mother is accorded priority where necessary treatment may harm the foetus. The Minister continued to say: He instanced the use of antibiotics or treatment for acute leukaemia which might have an adverse effect on the foetus. No court, no doctor will decide that he will not treat pneumonia or leukaemia. The standards of medical treatment are laid down very clearly. It is no harm to point out that medical ethics and treatment are regulated by the Medical Registration Council which was set up by an Act of this Oireachtas, the Medical Act. The treatment is straightforward, treatment for these conditions that has been continuing for the last 120 years since the 1861 Act. What was interesting this morning was that the Minister for Health did not quote from the professors who commented on the Taoiseach's wild remarks — I suppose that is the right way to describe them — that the original wording of the amendment would probably condemn to death women whose lives are now saved by operations which have been performed within the law for more than a century here and in the United Kingdom. The professors stated and I quote: Dr. Fitzgerald has also cast doubt on the legality of existing, well-established medical practice. This cannot go unchallenged. Doctors do not act on crude assumptions about the legality of their actions. Dr. FitzGerald's assertions [2161] will be a source of much unnecessary alarm. We have found the original wording proposed for the amendment to be entirely satisfactory. We believe that this wording would present us with no difficulty in the proper discharge of our professional responsibilities. I am surprised that that statement was not included in the Minister's remarks here this morning. That statement was signed by Professor John Bonnar, Professor Eamon De Valera, Professor David Jenkins, Professor Kieran O'Driscoll and Professor Eamon O'Dwyer, all eminent men in the field of obstetrics. Neither the Minister for Health this morning nor the Attorney General on radio on Sunday mentioned what I believe is a very important part of the wording of the original amendment, that is the qualifying phrases: 'with due regard to' and 'as far as practicable'. That is very important. When they say that a court will decide in law on the basis of the wording before it that both lives are equal and that because of that wording — leaving out the two phrases I have mentioned — the court will decide that the mother's life cannot be saved. Having regard to those two phrases it is obvious that even if a case were to be brought before the courts the courts would not interpret the Constitution to say that the woman's life must be put at risk in order to save the child. Again to quote the Minister for Health this morning: Above all other considerations this proposed Constitutional amendment affects the future wellbeing of every woman now of child-bearing age in our Republic and of women yet to be born in our State. Then he continued with an extraordinary piece as follows: This almost all male and almost all Catholic Dáil seems by majority determined for the most part to impose its moral values and medical criteria on the women of Ireland for decades to [2162] come. Shame on those of us who would do so today. In my view that is very intemperate language. Indeed if one continues to read the Minister's remarks this morning he makes the point himself when he said: It is also difficult to avoid the conclusion that the deep feeling of our people on this important issue is being used as a weapon in a party political conflict. I believe that describes exactly the quotation I have read about an almost all male and almost all Catholic Dáil. As far as I am concerned, this has nothing whatever to do with sectarianism, has nothing to do with the Catholic Church, Protestant Church. It should be the same law for the atheist, the Jew, anybody, because if one goes back — and there is medical input into this — to the Hippocratic Oath which was 4,400 years before Christanity, before Christ himself, there it is mentioned that abortion should not be procured on a woman. That is the basis of my thinking on the subject. The Minister for Health spoke this morning about the 55,000 women on the pill here and the 2,000 to 3,000 women who use intra-uterine devices, the importation of which is illegal. This has nothing to do with this amendment. If written into the Constitution this amendment will in no way change the existing law and has nothing to do with what is being used as a contraceptive device. Even if one were to accept that the intra-uterine device was an abortifacient it would be impossible to bring a court case and to prove it because the first thing one would have to do would be to prove that the woman was pregnant in the first place.;2071323

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Dr. Rory O'Hanlon;Fianna Fáil;: I agree with the Minister that we should address ourselves to the Committee Stage. I have before me a copy of the statement made by the Minister for Health this morning and I consider that I am entitled to reply to that Minister's comments. He said that the provisions of the 1861 Act are adequate to meet our needs in relation to abortion. I would not agree. The 1861 Act is still on the Statute Book in the UK but there is also there the 1967 Act which exempts doctors from culpability within the terms of the former Act if two doctors believe that a woman should have an abortion. As a result of the 1967 Act there have been more than 2 million abortions in Britain. Consequently, I do not consider the 1861 Act to be sufficient for us either.;2071350

398;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Dr. Rory O'Hanlon;Fianna Fáil;: At intervals of about six months an effort is made in the UK to bring in legislation to curtail the 1967 Act, to revert to what was intended originally by the proposers of that Act. The last such occasion was in December in the House of Lords. The Minister for Health tells us that it is an insult to the Members of this House and to the traditions of democracy in Ireland that the suggestion be made that [2166] we should have a referendum of this kind. I do not understand that. Surely on such a fundamental issue we should go to the people for a decision. We must face the fact that abortion is a divisive issue, that there are people who are opposed to abortion and that there are people who favour abortion. The only fair way of ensuring that the right decision is arrived at is to let the people have their say and to give them the opportunity, if they so wish, of having the amendment incorporated in the Constitution. The question of sectarianism has been raised in relation to this issue. The Minister for Health said that if he were a member of the Northern Ireland community he would take a very poor view of what was going on down here. It is no harm to remind the Minister that two leading politicians on the Protestant side in the North, Mr. Paisley and Mr. Molyneaux, opposed vehemently an extension of the 1967 Act to Northern Ireland. Regardless of what view anyone may have in relation to abortion, there will be respect for a society who are prepared to stand for the right to life of the unborn. The Minister referred at length to the number of girls going to the UK to have abortions. I commend him for bringing up the matter with the Medical Research Council with a view to having the situation studied further. I should hope that as a result of this debate here, the conscience of each of us would be stimulated into thinking of what we might do to ensure that it will not be necessary for any girl to seek an abortion. The difference I see in the original wording as circulated in the Bill and the wording proposed now is while there has been a lot of legal conflict about the existing wording, the new wording would mean that abortion could be introduced here at some stage without the question being put to the people by way of referendum. We must refer to the Constitution on such issues as land ownership and divorce. Is it not only right that the Constitution should also include the issue of abortion so that it would have to be referred to in the event of there ever being a question of the introduction of abortion? [2167] The Pro-Life Amendment Campaign group consist of eminent legal and medical people and they are satisfied that the original wording proposed would not in any way cause problems for the medical profession. In a statement which they issued yesterday they had this to say: Let it be clearly stated: there is nothing in the original form of words which would pose the slightest danger to Irish women. No established medical practice would be interfered with, doctors would not find themselves powerless to intervene to save the lives of mothers and nothing in the amendment would oblige any court anywhere to forbid operations already legally and ethically permissible.;2071353

400;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Dr. Rory O'Hanlon;Fianna Fáil;: I said that it was a statement issued yesterday by the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign people, a group comprising a number of eminent doctors and legal people. They include the professors who were so critical of the Taoiseach for his wild and frightening statements to women. Deputy Mac Giolla referred to my reference at Second Stage to treatment in the case of a ectopic pregnancy. I have referred to that again. What happens in such cases is standard procedure. The same applies in relation to cancer of the womb, a condition which Deputy Mac Giolla said is common. That is not the case. The last report available in this respect shows that five women under 45 died from cancer of the womb in 1973 while in 1976 the figure was eight. There is no indication, admittedly, that these women were pregnant. It is important to realise that the writing into the Constitution of the pro-life amendment as put forward by us would not change in any way the 1861 Act. That will be the law still. It was wrong for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Attorney General to mislead the people in the way they did. They have caused unnecessary [2168] concern among women who are expecting and those who are now going to their doctor asking if it is true that their life will be at risk. That is deplorable, and then on the Government side of the House they talk about the level and type of debates but that is the reason the debate has followed a certain line. As a medical doctor and a politician, I am satisfied that our wording is satisfactory and should be voted through the House this evening.;2071355

To put the matter straight, I should like to emphasise that I was present this morning when the debate commenced. I was present when the Minister for Justice made his speech and when Deputy Dr. Woods replied. It is not correct to say that I was not present. I indicated to our Whip that I wished to make a contribution but I understood that the debate would carry on in the same way as any other Committee Stage, that Members would get an opportunity of discussing in depth with the Minister aspects of the wording he was proposing. However, a list has been put together so that speakers know in advance on this Committee Stage when they will be permitted to speak. Consequently, because of the amount of time remaining, there will only be an opportunity, if people are permitted to continue to make Second Stage speeches, for about three or four more Members to get in. That is not fair or right when dealing with a matter on Committee Stage.;2071365

I pointed out, as a lawyer with no axe to grind other than taking the position which is identical to that of all Members, somebody who is opposed to abortion and disagrees with it, and sounded a whole series of warnings as to the possible consequences if those words were put to the people in a referendum and were later inserted in the Constitution. Those warning notes were reiterated by the Minister, Members on this side, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, a matter that has not been adverted to. I appealed to Deputies opposite to deal with this issue not as a matter of party politics or as a political football but to engage in proper, sensible dialogue to see, if we have to have a referendum, if it would be possible to put an appropriate form of wording to the people. I was anxious that the wording should not be ambiguous or create the difficulties that may be caused by the Fianna Fáil wording and would deal in a sensible and non-divisive way with the problem presented to us. On that occasion I said I suspected that I would not be listened to by Deputies opposite, that we were engaging in a dialogue of the deaf.;2071389

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;: We are still engaging in a dialogue of the deaf. In fact, today's speeches by Deputies opposite do not have anything to do with Committee Stage. Questions have not been put to the Minister and Members have not tried to tease out the advantages of the different forms of wording before the House. We have had from Deputies Woods and O'Hanlon a series of assertions that their form of words is correct and will not cause any problem to anybody. Because the pro-life amendment campaigners said the amendment will not cause any problem to anybody, ipso facto it will not [2173] cause a problem. We have had statements trotted out from eminent doctors and lawyers, but of course a person is always eminent if their point of view coincides with the political point one is trying to make. There has been a total failure on the part of Members opposite to refer to comments made by many concerned members of the medical profession, by many concerned lawyers and by many churchmen of all churches who have expressed grave and serious doubts and worries about the form of wording contained in the Fianna Fáil amendment. We have had the five gynaecologists trotted out to us on a regular basis. No mention has been made of more than 100 members of the medical profession who issued a statement on 25 January expressing extreme concern about the consequences of this form of words becoming part of our Constitution. No effort has been made to tease out the conflicting views which have been expressed by people whom we would all regard as eminent. I regard Dr. Henry of the Rotunda Hospital as being as eminent as Dr. de Valera. I do not have to attach the qualification of eminence only to those members of the medical profession who hold views I wish to propagate for political purposes. There has been no attempt made to see if some meeting point could be reached in putting an appropriate form of wording to the people in a referendum. Deputy Woods, suffering from a form of political infallibility, has indicated that he is right and because he says he is right we are supposed to believe him. We are engaged not in discussing what is an appropriate form of wording to put to the people in a referendum we are engaged in a piece of party politics. We are playing political football with an issue which is of genuine concern to many people outside this House. At the end of the day we are not talking about the issue at all we are talking about a beauty contest — do the people on the far side of the House regard Charlie as more beautiful than Garret or do we over here regard Garret as more beautiful than Charlie? The issue has [2174] long since been lost in a plethora of party political commentary. Let us try to deal with the wording we are supposed to be discussing on Committee Stage. Deputy Woods made some references to the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment and gave to this House the benefit of his interpretation of the effects of the Fianna Fáil wording. He said it has been established in the courts in the context of existing personal rights contained in our Constitution that none of these personal rights is absolute or unlimited and he stated that the Fianna Fáil proposal does not contain absolute or unlimited rights for the unborn. He went on to say that the law of the State may make provision for the right to life of the mother when it is threatened and that the mother will be entitled to medical treatment for illness, even if such treatment would result in termination of pregnancy. I do not know what Deputy Woods means by that. Does he mean that the Fianna Fáil amendment allows the State to pass legislation to permit abortion? That is what he seems to be indicating.;2071391

443;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;: The DPP has expressed grave concern as to the possibility of bringing proceedings under the 1861 Act if this amendment becomes part of the Constitution. Deputy Woods has admitted in this House that the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment is ambiguous and open to a variety of different interpretations. That is what has been said by Members on this side. He has admitted that it is deliberately phrased not in absolute or unlimited terms but is phrased in a vague way whereby there are different rights in existence upon which at some stage the courts will have to adjudicate. My understanding of the case put by those who propose the need for an amendment is that we need certainty in this area of the law, that the courts should be kept out of it and that the matter should be decided once and for all by way of some provision in our Constitution. It is clear that the matter will not be decided once and for all by the inclusion of these words in the Constitution because the courts will have to tell us what all these words mean. We have heard from Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Hanlon that in the context of these words being included in the Constitution by holding a referendum we are engaged in a democratic exercise. They ask whether it is not right on a fundamental issue of this nature that the people should be given an opportunity to make a final decision and to take the issue out of the hands of this House and, presumably, since this was the original rationale, to take the decision out of the hands of the courts. The people will pronounce in referendum that this is the form of wording we have, the tablets of stone will be handed down to us and there the matter will rest uncontested. Of course that is not the case because if the Fianna Fáil form of wording becomes part of our Constitution it may prevent the elected representatives in this House from enacting legislation to permit abortion — something no members of any party has suggested he would do or is desirable — but it will place it in the hands of five members of the Supreme Court to introduce abortion if they see fit on the phraseology [2176] of the wording proposed by Fianna Fáil. This is the inverse of democracy. We are asking the people in a referendum on this form of words to deprive this House of jurisdiction or entitlement to legislate in this area and to transfer that authority to five members of the Supreme Court. Where is the democracy in that? The only way this would be a democratic exercise would be if there were some full and final set of words which were not open to a mixture of different interpretations, a form of words which people could clearly understand and vote for. That is not the case with the Fianna Fáil wording. Just as Members opposite have milked the notion of eminence to give some sort of credence to their case, I would equally milk it by saying that there are as many eminent members of the legal and medical professions who see extreme dangers in this form of wording as there are members who are supporting it. From the calculations I have seen there are a damn sight more people who are opposed to it than there are people supporting it. The five eminent gynaecologists are a damn sight more noisy than are the 100 or more doctors who issued a statement on 25 January and looked aghast at the insanity in this House. Let us get away from the shibboleth of suggesting that this referendum is about asking people to make a democratic decision, if the Fianna Fáil wording goes to the people. It is about asking the people to put a form of words into the Constitution, the meaning of which no one in this House can be certain, other than Deputies O'Hanlon and Woods who have this infallible interpretation to which they feel they can adhere. They are convinced it is right because they have been told it is right by people who think it is right. I do not think it is necessary for me to go into any detail about the defects in the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment. The Minister has referred to them already and I have referred to them at length previously, as have colleagues of mine. It is interesting to note that Deputies opposite have not been willing so far to engage in a Committee Stage analysis [2177] of the words contained in their amendment. They have not yet touched on the problem so well and unusually referred to by the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is interesting to note that all they can do is support the form of words they are proposing by assertion and by reference to other assertions made by other people. We have on the opposite side of the House a great monolithic party who believe that discipline on all issues is essential. Members vote parrot-like on whatever issue comes before them on the basis of what they are told by the party leader. Fortunately, in the Fine Gael Party, we have people who exercise their minds in regard to their responsibilities as legislators more seriously than merely being some form of lobby fodder to make crass political points. I know, as do Members opposite, that there are a number of members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are as concerned about the implications in the Fianna Fáil wording as some Members probably are on this side of the House. They are frightened to say a word about it in the House, they are frightened to articulate that concern because, if they do, they will be hounded out of the party for daring to act as legislators, for daring to sound a warning.;2071398

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;: In relation to the Fine Gael wording proposed by the Minister for Justice there are a number of advantages in it that clearly place it in a far superior position in the context of a form of wording to be put to the people. It is not ambiguous. There is no doubt about what it says. It says that no law can be declared unconstitutional by reason of the fact that it prohibits abortion. It copperfastens the 1861 Act. It does not create any problems for the Director of Public Prosecutions in bringing prosecutions under that Act. It prevents the Supreme Court, as some people seem to believe is necessary, legislating for abortion through the side door by way of judicial decision. It achieves all the objectives originally set out and described as needing to be dealt with by the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign. There has not been any sensible or logical suggestion made by Members opposite in their contributions why the Fine Gael wording does not adequately meet the situation. We are told by Deputy Woods, parrot-like, that it is not pro-life. That is a fine phrase. It is anti-abortion. I presume that if you are anti-abortion you are pro-life just as if you are pro-life you are anti-abortion. We are not engaged in dealing with what is a desirable constitutional amendment. We are engaged in an exercise of political semantics [2179] for the purpose of scoring political points. If it is anti-abortion it is pro-life. Is anybody suggesting that if it is anti-abortion it is anti-life? Is there any Member opposite who can suggest some interesting logical reasoning that can reach that conclusion? I have not heard it said but, parrot-like, we trot out: 'Ah, well, it is not pro-life'. I am a Deputy in this House for only two-and-a-half years, I am only a mere lawyer I have only been working in the family law area for about ten years. I accept that I am something of a political innocent and maybe I am missing something in this. The only thing I am missing in this is the game Members opposite are trying to play, which is to suggest that because Fine Gael have proposed a new form of wording maybe somewhere in the Fine Gael Party there are people who will be sneaking in some time, some day, to promote legislation to permit abortion in this country. Every Deputy opposite knows that is absolute nonsense. There is nobody on this side of the House who would favour the introduction of legislation to permit abortion but Members on this side of the House are concerned that the Fianna Fáil wording might be the very vehicle by which abortion could be introduced through our courts' system. That is something the Members opposite will not countenance as a possibility. There is no possible argument to be made by supporting the Fianna Fáil wording as opposed to the Fine Gael wording other than that of political point scoring and using this as a cynical exercise to do what Charlie wants, in some way to use this issue to embarrass Garret. They feel that it is a great issue and they have got everybody wrong footed. It is the most cynical, disgusting piece of politicking I have seen in the House since I came in here, on an issue concerned with amending the Constitution. I have said in other places as well as in the House that in real terms there is no legal necessity for an amendment of any nature. I spoke at length on this when I made my contribution on 17 February last. I have been confirmed in that view by a judgment of the Supreme Court last [2180] Friday. In that case the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice McCarthy, a dissenting judge, indicated quite clearly that in their view the Constitution as it stands at the moment protects the right to life of the unborn child. In the context of that case Mr. Justice McCarthy said that he could not delimit the area in which the State might constitutionally intervene to restrict the right to privacy. It is the right to privacy that the Members opposite and the pro-life campaign have suggested might result in the Supreme Court providing for some form of abortion. He said he could not restrict the right of privacy nor could he overlook the present public debate concerning the criminal law arising from the statute of 1861 as to abortion, the killing of an unborn child. He said that this was not an issue which arose in the present case but it might be claimed that the right of privacy of a pregnant woman could extend to a right in her to terminate a pregnancy, an act which would involve depriving the unborn child of the most fundamental right of all, the right to life itself. He said he recognised there had been no argument in this particular case in relation to this issue but nothing in his judgment, expressed or implied, was to be taken as supporting a view that the provisions of section 58 of the 1861 Act making it a criminal offence to procure an abortion were in any way inconsistent with the Constitution. The provisions of the Preamble of the Constitution, he went on to say, would appear to lean heavily against any view other than that the right to life of the unborn child was a sacred trust to which all organs of Government must lend their support. As recently as last Friday the Supreme Court indicated clearly that the amendment campaign was nonsense and unnecessary.;2071408

If we must have a referendum it should be on a form of words the people understand and about which there is no ambiguity. We must not put a form of words to the people which they will not understand or will not understand the implications of. The vast majority of people outside the House see this debate as an irrelevancy and something of an obscenity because of the way in which it has developed. I believe from what I have heard directly from some Members of the pro-life campaign that they are deeply shocked at the way the debate has developed in the context of the divisions which have been created between the different churches. I deplore the selective quotations used by Deputy Woods to put forward his case and suggest that all minority religions fully support the proposal his party put to the House. That is untrue. We are not dealing with ordinary legislation but are seeking to arrive at a consensus for amending the Constitution. It is a disgrace for a Deputy of long-standing and particularly one who was a former Minister to try to put forward a case of this nature which he knows is untenable. He knows there are divisions.

It has been distributed in schools, at ladies' clubs and so on. Instead of ensuring people do not have abortions we have taught them how to have them and where to go to get them. We have done nothing to tackle the real problem of 5,000 [2183] women going across the water to have abortions. I do not believe my contribution will result in any sanity being brought to bear on Members opposite. However, if I did not make my contribution to the debate I would be abrogating my responsibility as a Member of the House to state my views on the issue and attempt, futile as it might be, to influence Members opposite to adopt a more responsible approach to this issue. I do not expect that they will. I suspect we will kick the political football until 6. 30 p. m. today. I hope some of the Deputies opposite who have genuine doubts and worries about the issue will think about the implications of the Fianna Fáil wording. They should seriously consider the responsibility which rests on their shoulders as legislators to support a form of wording which does not have the divisive element or the ambiguities contained in the Fianna Fáil wording and which will not transfer responsibility in this area from this House to the shoulders of five members of the Supreme Court.;2071422
468;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: I hope it will be possible to have a normal Committee Stage discussion from here on. I do not intend to make a speech but to ask the Minister some questions. Deputy Shatter said this amendment copperfastens the 1861 Act. How does the Minister see it doing that? In his speech this morning, which was unprecedented in that it was a formal speech introducing an amendment on Committee Stage, he said the Attorney General advised the Government that the original words proposed by the Minister, that is, the words 'or to deprive of force or effect' were adequate to protect the 1861 Act. The Minister said: ... it was entirely adequate to achieve its objective and that the technical criticisms that had been made about the alleged insufficiency of the word 'invalidate' were not well founded. Nevertheless, because the criticisms had been made and were being persisted in, I did not think it right that we in this House should [2184] embark on a futile and time-wasting argument about a side-issue and, as the Attorney General was satisfied that a few words could be added without harm to the meaning, the amendment that I am now formally putting to the House includes, as well as the word 'invalidate', those extra words, that is, the words 'or to deprive of force or effect'. Is the Minister saying there is no need for the extra words to protect the 1861 Act?;2071423
469;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East): Criticisms were made that by the use of the word 'invalidate' legislation passed prior to 1937 would not be covered by this amendment. I do not accept that nor does the Attorney General but because I envisaged a situation where we would spend a lot of time arguing about the effect of the amendment it was decided to strengthen the words. I refer the Deputy to Article 50º of the Constitution: Subject to this Constitution and to the extent to which they are not inconsistent therewith, the laws in force in Saorstát Éireann immediately prior to the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall continue to be of full force and effect until the same or any of them shall have been repealed or amended by enactment of the Oireachtas. The force and effect phrase is taken from Article 50º and is to be in accord with that and not because the amendment was defective. There is a tendency in this issue to be sidetracked. In my innocence, I wanted the House to debate the merits and demerits of one wording against the other.;2071424

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: Let us do that now. The Minister has quite clearly put on the record that the Attorney General, who advises the Government on legal and constitutional matters and he, the Minister, acting on the Attorney General's advice in these matters, do not see the necessity for adding any words to protect [2185] pre-1937 legislation to the original words he proposed.;2071425

474;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: Those words are in the amendment. If that is the view of the Attorney General and if he has advised the Government that invalidation will cover pre-1937 Acts, he is running contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court which I am sure the Attorney General is aware of and must have so informed the Government in a case that is widely known, the State (at the prosecution of Francis James Sheerin) v. Michael Kennedy, 1966 Irish Reports, page 386. It specifically states: ... the question of determining the validity of a law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution can only refer to laws enacted by the Oireachtas established by the Constitution ... where the law referred to is not expressly referred to as a law of the Oireachtas ... must be treated as meaning that the validity in question is a validity to be determined by the provisions of the Constitution in respect of something purporting to have been done within the terms of the Constitution and within the powers conferred by the Constitution. I am quoting from a Supreme Court judgment, not as Deputy Shatter has wrongly implied, one opinion from one judge in a matter not before it. He called that a Supreme Court judgment in respect of an obiter dictum of one judge. The Deputy must know that that is not a Supreme Court judgment. I am quoting from a [2186] unanimous judgement of the Supreme Court. It goes on to say: ... the question of determining the validity of a law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution can only refer to laws enacted by the Oireachtas established by the Constitution. In the light of that, the Minister is telling us that the Attorney General who is charged to give legal and constitutional advice to the Government, said that the original words which referred to 'invalidate' could cover pre-1937 legislation. If that is so, the Attorney General and the Minister accepting his advice are flying in the face of established laws and they must know it. I see Deputy Kelly here and if he wishes to make a point——;2071429

It is a limited debate and Deputy O'Kennedy is out of order, in my respectful submission, in making a point which is directed solely to calling into question the professional ability of the Attorney General and which is not directed towards the amendment submitted by the Minister before the House. That is the sole objective of his contribution and he is taking up the time of the House——;2071434

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: The Minister indicated initially that the Attorney General [2187] advised the Government that the original words proposed by him were adequate to cover pre-1937 legislation. I am suggesting they are not. The Minister indicated this morning that even though the Attorney General was so satisfied, he decided to advise, so that we would not be engaged in a time-wasting exercise, that the inclusion of other words 'or to deprive of force and effect.' Although not necessary, the Attorney General apparently said to put them in there anyway. Even putting them in does not cure the defect in the ministerial amendment. There is another established principle of law, a principle of construction and interpretation, that where you add words like 'or to deprive of force and effect' and they follow specific words such as 'invalidation', then they must be interpreted under the principle of justum generis, of the same nature, as applying to the same condition as the original word, namely, 'invalidate'. The word 'invalidate', by Supreme Court decision, only applies and is restricted in this context to post-1937 Constitution. Therefore, the addition of what the Minister sees as a futile gesture in any case——;2071436

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: Is the Minister saying that the Supreme Court judgment in Sheerin and Kennedy does not mean that the words he originally introduced would only apply to post-1937 legislation? I hold that it does and that the Minister's [2188] attempt to correct it does not do so in any event. All this demonstrates the futility of pursuing the line that the Government have in relation to this question.;2071441

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East): Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution proves that I was correct in the political judgment of adding the extra words because it was quite obvious from the attacks made on the wording I suggested at the close of Second Stage, that not alone would PLAC and various opponents of the amendment I suggested go along the lines that Deputy O'Kennedy has gone along, but many eminent people who inhabit the Opposition benches would make long argument all day long and we would discuss nothing else.;2071442

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East): My advice is that the original wording, if I may so call it, as I indicated at the end of Second Stage was totally adequate to fulfil the purpose that we intended to fulfil. So as not to be sidetracked along the lines that Deputy O'Kennedy has been sidetracking the House we decided to put in the extra words. The extra words should have taken that aspect of the debate out of the House completely, because what is there now meets the spurious arguments put forward and it meets every point that the Deputy has made.;2071444
490;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: The Minister has replied with a very bland statement and said that his advice is that the original words he introduced apply to pre-1937 legislation. I quoted from the Supreme Court judgment in a very well-known case which clearly said the opposite. Is the Minister saying now that his advice is that the Supreme Court, unanimously in that case, were wrong in their interpretation? He and his Attorney General will find, if they go before the Supreme Court on the basis that they bind themselves by a unanimous decision already taken, that the court will hold that the terminology he has does not apply to the post- or pre-1937 Constitutions. It is not enough for the Minister to say in reply in the face [2189] of that kind of evidence, 'my advice is', and then to imply that the question I raised is being raised purely for the sake of political hassle or something of that kind. It is not. Confining myself to the text of the Supreme Court judgment, if Deputy Kelly, who is not engaged to advise the Government, now comes to his aid—— (Interruptions.);2071445

If one person in this House can demonstrate that I will give way to him, but it is not enough for the Minister to say, 'I am advised that' and then to imply that the Opposition when questioning that advice are engaging in what someone called political football. I leave it to any one of them to demonstrate that.;2071446

It was exactly to avoid what he is doing now that we put in these extra words. There is no doubt whatever, with the attacks made by the legal advisers to the pro-life movement and the attacks made by some of the Deputies opposite, that we would have a long and futile debate on this point. There is no need for it now because to the word 'invalidate' which the Deputy is objecting to, has been added, 'or to deprive of force or effect'.;2071449

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: This Minister this morning is on record in this House as saying that the Attorney General advised him and the Government that the original [2190] words without the addition of those words he is now proposing to add were adequate to apply to the 1937 Constitution or to pre-1937 legislation. That is why I worry about the constitutional advice he is getting. That is self-evidently wrong and could not be more wrong. Any judicial interpretation would have to hold that. The Minister is now saying that, despite the fact that it covers pre-1937 legislation, to avoid any hassle in this House he is going to bring in some extra words, 'or to deprive of force or effect'. That would mean that the unreasonable Opposition here should be satisfied now.;2071450

Keeping us quiet is not the issue here. There is a very strong probability on the general rule of construction of the justum generis, of the same type, that the words can be interpreted only as applying to the pre-1937 Constitution in addition to the original word 'invalidate' because they are appended to it. I cannot be definite about it but I have regard to that rule of construction that is applied throughout the law.;2071452

If what the Minister said here this morning in the early part of his speech is a record of fact as to the constitutional advice he is getting from the Attorney General and the Government are acting on that, then they have very bad advice indeed. I suggest that if these are words which the Government [2191] propose — and they are the words of the Government, not of Fine Gael if a Minister proposes here an amendment he proposes it on behalf of the Government — there is something very wrong.

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Professor John M. Kelly;Fine Gael;: It is all right, I know what the judgment is about. If I recall correctly, the point about the judgment is that it disentangled various usages in regard to the constitutionality of legislation. Only Bills under the Article 26 procedure could be spoken of as repugnant. Acts passed before the present Oireachtas came into existence had to be spoken of as inconsistent with the existing Constitution and Acts subsequent to 1937 — I hope I have already got full marks from some of the people over there for this — are spoken of as being valid or invalid as the case may be, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. The Minister's [2192] original draft of his amendment contained the word 'invalidate'. I have not had a chance to look it up but I believe that that word does not occur in the Constitution as distinct from the word 'valid' in any context material to what Deputy O'Kennedy has been saying. Any judge standing on his heels and not on his head would hold that word adequately to cover all legislation whether of this Oireachtas, the last Oireachtas or the pre-1922 authority then passing laws for this country. I may be wrong in thinking so. If the Minister thinks so I will agree with him, but there is the other point of view that perhaps, if the Sheerin judgment is to be interpreted as pedantically as Deputy O'Kennedy suggests, this word might be held to apply only to post-1937 legislation and therefore not to insulate the 1861 Act which was passed by the former authorities and accordingly an Act to which some expression like 'inconsistently' would be more appropriately applied. The Minister has solved this — he does not think that this problem exists nor do I — to the satisfaction of those who doubt it by saying that we will look at the Article of the Constitution which carries over and keeps in force all the pre-1937 legislation, whether it be that of the old Oireachtas or of the British. That article speaks about such laws remaining in full force and effect unless inconsistent with the Constitution. That phrase which the Minister put in is specifically designed to insulate pre-1937 legislation. With all the other absurdities in this constitutional and political pantomime we are engaging in here, this is the bottom.;2071460

What is being advised by the Government is very bad. The formula used here is also used in Articles 29, 37 and 40 of the Constitution —'nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate provisions of the law... '. In one case it applies to our membership of the European Economic Community — nothing in the Constitution would invalidate laws we pass to give [2195] effect to our membership of the Community. That could not have been contemplated at the time of the enactment of the 1937 Constitution. It is also mentioned in the section dealing with emergency legislation. In that case we suspend the Constitution and say that nothing in this Constitution would operate to invalidate acts done at a particular time. Those are the two exceptions where we suspend the Constitution. The Government now propose that we suspend the Constitution for a particular purpose which is neither necessary nor appropriate —'nothing in this Constitution shall apply to invalidate .. .'. To any constitutional lawyer that kind of formula is unwelcome. It could be said to be an insult to the Constitution. There is no need to insert the clause 'nothing in the Constitution shall apply' that——;2071486

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: We talk about a law which prohibits abortion but I want to ask the Minister precisely what he means by that. Is it a law which prohibits abortion in all circumstances or in some circumstances? In his proposal the Minister [2196] uses this phrase: 'Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate, or to deprive of force or effect, any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion.' Does that apply to a law that prohibits abortion in all circumstances or in some circumstances? Can it be said to be a law which permits abortion in some cases but prohibits it in others? I do not know exactly what that phrase means and this is what a court interpreting this legislation would have to look to. How general or extensive is it? As has been asked many times, what is it that prohibits abortion? As the Minister knows, abortion is not legally defined and has not been legally defined, although it is legally and constitutionally being used.;2071492

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;: It is not contained in the relevant provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which at the moment prohibits the act called abortion. The word is not used in that Act. Of course it is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary which is often looked at by lawyers when they try to interpret the normal meaning of words. There it is defined as 'a miscarriage' or 'the procurement of a miscarriage'. It is also defined as 'a dwarf or deformed person'. They are the known definitions. A spontaneous miscarriage by a pregnant woman is frequently if not usually referred to by the medical profession as 'an abortion', or 'a spontaneous abortion'. I want to know from the Minister what is he suggesting to be the meaning of 'abortion'? Does it apply to a law that prohibits abortion in all cases or in some cases, and if in some cases what kind of cases does it extend to? What does 'it' refer to in the Minister's wording of Part II of his amendment to the Schedule, which states: Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate, or to deprive of force or effect, any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion. Does it refer to the provision in a law or [2197] the full law itself? The Minister is introducing something very fundamental and it is important that the parliamentary draftsman or the Attorney General would be able to tell us what exactly is the legal definition. I think the House should be given some response by the Minister.;2071494

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;: I am working from notes. I will be reading some extracts from the Dáil Official Report. Deputy Woods is speaking about lack of definitions. During the election campaign I said I had many reservations about the implications of the amendment as proposed by the Fianna Fáil Government. I have felt since that those reservations were justified. The Attorney General, in offering his opinion on the interpretation of some of the words in the Fianna Fáil proposed amendment, has vindicated my opinion. I accept his legal opinion, which points out the difficulties of interpretation by the Supreme Court of certain words and phrases, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn. It is clear that the word 'unborn' is likely to be interpreted by the Supreme Court as the moment at which the human ovum is penetrated by a sperm — the moment when human life commences. In the course of the Second Stage debate on this topic Deputy Woods made the point — and I find it ironic now [2198] that Deputy O'Kennedy should be questioning the Minister in relation to the lack of definition ——;2071497

544;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;: The Deputy is recorded in the Official Report for 9 February last at column 1386 in the following manner: Despite what would undoubtedly have been the wish of the promoters of this amendment and the majority church in this island, there is no attempt in the wording of the amendment to define the moment at which the life of the unborn begins. The amendment does not attempt to make this definition. Most, of course, would argue that it begins at the time of conception, but this is a matter of theological and scientific argument and in preparing the wording of the amendment we felt it was not appropriate to the Constitution to have such definitions. I do not understand, if one side do not think it appropriate to have definitions, how they can then turn around to the other side and ask them for definitions of the very words they were not prepared to define themselves. The whole issue here is lack of definition in the 1861 Act which we should be updating and not attempting to tackle our Constitution in this haphazard manner. If this interpretation should be placed on the word 'unborn' then I believe some forms of contraception which are now acceptable would be declared illegal and the phrase 'with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother' could mean that various established medical practices which are now ethically acceptable could be declared illegal. With these fundamental legal objections to the Fianna Fáil wording, I believe there is also the possibility that the Supreme Court could rule on the Fianna Fáil wording in such a way as to permit abortion. Therefore, as far as I am concerned it can be clearly seen that there are major defects in the Fianna Fáil wording which, if passed, the people of the country would be asked to vote on, knowing that the [2199] Supreme Court almost certainly will have to rule at a later stage and which ruling would have serious social implications. It is both inappropriate and unfortunate that we the legislators would allow something to be passed here this evening of which we are not sure of the definition and the scope or the extent of the effects it will have on Irish life in the immediate and long term future. Since the wording was published, I and many others have become increasingly disturbed by the implications which it has for religious harmony in this part of the island. It has become clear that the Protestant Churches here regard the passing ——;2071499

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;: I am entitled to express my opinion. The Protestant Churches see the passing of the Fianna Fáil amendment as including in our Constitution a definition of 'life' which reflects the theological position of the Catholic Church. Regardless of the validity of this view, we should give due consideration to having included in the Constitution a section which is seen by a substantial minority as objectionable. I do not believe that due consideration has been given to this. It is my opinion that we should be looking to the new Forum to develop a Constitution which in the final analysis could unify the people of the country. The inclusion in the Constitution of the Fianna Fáil [2200] amendment could not in any way contribute to Irish unity but could seriously damage the trust which we seek from Northern Unionists. In the past, Fianna Fáil always claimed, and they do so now, to be the Republican Party. Yet they appear to be totally oblivious to the objections to their wording raised by the Protestant Churches. I would be interested to hear from them how they see their amendment as uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter under the common name of Irishmen.;2071505

557;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;: Another disturbing aspect of the pro-life campaign has been its failure to address itself to something on which everyone in this House would agree, that is, that the problem we are talking about is abortion. The passing of this amendment will do nothing to reduce the numbers of Irish girls having abortions each year. The vast majority of girls who have abortions do so not because they want to, but because of social and economic pressures which they are unable to withstand. As a society we must adopt a much more caring attitude to this problem. We must abolish the status of illegitimacy and remove the stigma which attaches to it. We should welcome every child into our society and help the mother feel pride rather than shame. We should make economic provisions for women so that there [2201] would be no question of abortion for economic reasons. These areas are fundamental to a reduction in the number of abortions. If the time and energy spent on this amendment had been directed at the root causes of abortion, namely, the economic and social conditions for pregnant women, our society would be the better for it today. We must create a caring society in which the quality of life is understood to be important. I do not see how this amendment in any way could further that cause. I have stated that for the reasons given I am opposed to the Fianna Fáil amendment as drafted. Nothing has been said in the course of this debate, either on Second Stage or today, to convince me that there is an overwhelming desire or necessity for such an amendment, particularly in view of the obiter dicta in the Norris judgment last week by two Supreme Court judges, which clearly showed that there is implicit protection for the unborn in our Constitution. I am also extremely concerned about the statement made by the Director of Public Prosecutions that he could find it more difficult to prosecute persons carrying out abortions if the Fianna Fáil amendment before us were passed and enacted by the people.;2071512

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;: There are serious implications in this. Many times in the past I have heard my colleagues across the floor of the House making pleas to the Labour Party to do certain things, more often when we were in Government than when we were in Opposition. They said they wanted to assist the Labour Party and would appreciate it if we took certain courses of action. There must be some people amongst the 75 Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches who have minds of their own and who can think about the possible wording of the amendment to go before the people. I do not accept that the Whip should be imposed on them on this issue because reservations have been expressed in public. This evening their [2203] voting pattern should reflect those reservations rather than their obedience to the party Whip or party unity. The Fianna Fáil amendment will make bad law. It will cause serious problems in future. I regret that neither of the wordings before us has been properly defined. We should have the definitions in this House and not in the Supreme Court which, likewise, has been dragged into disrepute in the course of this debate. I consider that totally unnecessary. If we have not got the ability, the authority or the guts to define the amendment in this House, we should not be going before the people.;2071524

573;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;: A number of Deputies are very concerned about terminology. It is not widely enough recognised, possibly due to the hysterical and rushed way in which the campaign for this amendment has been conducted — and the rushed way in which debate today has been conducted we opposed the guillotine this morning and got no support for our opposition to it — that the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment could well spell the end of the only safe methods of contraception now available to thousands of Irish women. This point was the primary concern of the doctors who held a press conference on 24 January last to voice their opposition to the amendment. It is important to note who these doctors are. In many cases they are leading specialists in their fields, men and women we entrust with [2204] the health and future well-being of our people. Can we afford to ignore their fears? No doubt Deputies on various sides of the House can produce other eminent specialists who will offer alternative views. The facts are that there are many differing views on this issue. For that reason it is very important that the issue should be discussed and it was for that reason only that we put down the amendments to the Fianna Fáil wording. We wanted to get a reasonable, adult, sane debate on the issue, which we have not had so far today, apart from the contribution by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Shatter who attempted to approach the actual issues which will arise if an amendment is passed here today. This amendment could dramatically affect not only the health but in some cases the lives of women. Professor Dermot Hourihane, Dean of the School of Medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, had this to say last January: We have been advised that a number of methods of contraception at present commonly prescribed by doctors could become illegal if the amendment once passed receives an interpretation defining the term 'unborn' as existing from the moment of fertilisation. In some cases these are the only really safe methods available to our patients, particularly to older women. Among other things Professor Hourihane was referring to the intra-uterine device, one of the few methods of birth control available to women who smoke, who are for various reasons unsuited to the pill, or who have reached an age at which the use of the pill becomes increasingly dangerous. One theory is that its presence in the uterus creates a condition which increases the number of white blood cells which in turn destroys spermatoza, in which case the IUD could not be seen as interfering with the fertilised ovum. Other theories, however, are that the presence of the IUD inhibits implantation of the fertilised ovum in the womb, in which case the IUD could be interpreted as an abortifacient and, thus, [2205] become illegal if the amendment is so interpreted. This is what we are leaving ourselves open to. We have already seen a display of the differences that arise between lawyers whom we assume have studied the cases involved and have come to different conclusions. If this method of contraception were to be banned, it would put hundreds of thousands of women in jeopardy of further pregnancies, in danger of bearing children they do not want in circumstances seriously threatening to their own lives and health. More than 2,500 IUDs were inserted in 1981. What is of particular concern to The Workers' Party is that in practice the IUD is overwhelmingly used by working-class women. Last year Dr. Helen Watson conducted the first comprehensive study of the use of the IUD in Ireland. She found that 34. 7 per cent of IUD users were wives of manual workers 27 per cent were wives of unemployed men and that 35. 4 per cent of IUD users were also medical card holders. Dr. Watson also found that more IUD users had four to six children than women who used other forms of contraception, and that a far higher proportion were in the 35 to 44 year age group. She concluded that 'a significantly higher proportion of women using IUDs have large families are entitled to medical card treatment have husbands in the lower occupational groupings have husbands who are unemployed and come from the lowest socio-economic parts of Dublin.' Dr. Mary Henry, Consultant Physician to the Rotunda Thrombo-Embolic Unit, has found that the number of deaths due to thrombo-embolism have fallen dramatically in women over 35 years with many children. This fall is due in the main to the increased use of the IUD or coil. Yet, we are talking about passing an amendment that may make illegal the use of this device. If the fears doctors have expressed with regard to the interpretation of the amendment are realised, the women this amendment threatens to most affect are precisely those women already most over-burdened with the injustices of this society — large families, low income or [2206] no income at all but the dole, poor housing and high prices. Why is it that the advocates of this amendment have carefully concealed this fact, have neglected to give publicity to the fact that the 40-year old working-class wife with half-a-dozen children, the woman struggling to make ends meet and rear her family responsibly in extreme hardship, is very probably going to be the first victim of this amendment? There is another form of contraception quite likely to be banned should this amendment be interpreted as Professor Hourihane described, and that is the Progesterone Only Pill. The consequences of banning this will have serious medical effects for the great numbers of women, who because of their age, have too high a cardiovascular risk to take the combined pill, women who have vascular heart disease and cannot take the combined pill and women who are breast-feeding. This pill is also the only pill suited to diabetic women. As a medical development the Progesterone Only Pill represents a significant advance and the numbers of women taking this form of treatment have increased considerably in recent years. Are we now to become the only country in the modern world today to deny women the benefits of medical research because a small minority insist that one area of philosophical debate be defined in their terms, and in their terms only, and imposed on the rest of the nation? The medical facts appear to be that all women who use the pill may be put at a disadvantage by this amendment. Since 1980 a new form of pill, the 'triphasic' pill has been on the market with a very low dose of oestrogen. Many of these pills may not inhibit ovulation as the older versions of the pill do but may also act by preventing implantation of a fertilised ovum. These new pills are much safer for older women and for younger women alike because of the very low doses of hormones used are less likely to produce changes in the blood associated with clotting. If low-dose pills are to become illegal, we will be the only country in the world to force our women [2207] to use high-dose oral contraceptives with all their attendant medical risks. Finally, we must look at the question of post-coital contraception. In recent years the availability of safe and effective 'morning after' treatment to prevent pregnancy has become a reality. The woman who is at risk of pregnancy from unprotected intercourse — whether the event was an unplanned encounter, whether she is a victim of accident or misplaced diaphragm or whether she is the tragic victim of rape — can now avail of a simple and effective means of protecting herself from an unwanted pregnancy. The treatment consists of two doses of oral contraceptive tablets taken within three days of the event. This acts by preventing the implantation of the fertilised ovum in the womb and there is no question but that its availability has already prevented hundreds of thousands of unplanned, unwanted pregnancies. One of the most important aspects of the 'morning after' pill is that it may be the most effective means yet of reducing the abortion figures. In the University of British Columbia, where post-coital contraception was made available seven days a week and widely publicised, the rate of abortion among college students dropped by half. Many continental doctors are hopeful that with enough education and facilities similar improvements could be made on abortion statistics throughout the world. Yet, ironically, here in Ireland we are actually considering an amendment to the Constitution that would outlaw post-coital contraception and do nothing practical to help reduce the abortion rates in this country. I appeal to Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches who know this amendment is wrong to refuse to support it.;2071528
574;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Dr. Sean (Tipperary) McCarthy;Fianna Fáil;: The Minister for Health speaking in this House this morning said that the public debate that has taken place has proven to be divisive to an extent unprecedented in recent times. He said it has generated confusion and bitterness that do not provide a stable basis for decisions on matters as important as changing our Constitution. Further [2208] in his speech he mentioned what Deputy De Rossa has been speaking about, namely, the possibility that contraception as it is practised at present would not be legal if our amendment were introduced. I am glad Deputy De Rossa has taken such an intensive and authoritative course on the types of contraception that seem to be available. Obviously he has carried out a considerable amount of reading on the matter. I wish to state that what the Minister and Deputy De Rossa said, that contraception as it is practised might not be allowable, is totally untrue. I wish to quote from the Irish Independent of 4 March 1983. The article written by Kevin Moore states: The Irish Medical Association has declared that the Fianna Fáil wording of the anti-abortion Amendment to the Constitution does not conflict with medical ethics.;2071529

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Dr. Sean (Tipperary) McCarthy;Fianna Fáil;: I will continue with the quotation: This is the view of the Association's Ethical Committee which has been endorsed by the IMA Central Council. It runs counter to the reservations expressed by the present Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, SC. The IMA Central Council wanted guidance on whether there might be conflict between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the unborn and on whether certain contraceptive methods might be banned. A member of the Central Council said yesterday that the Ethical Committee found that there would be no departure from existing medical practice. The Attorney General, Mr. Sutherland, has suggested that certain contraceptives and family planning techniques might be outlawed if the Fianna Fáil wording were adopted. However the IMA's Ethical Committee found that the use of contraceptives would not be affected and this [2209] interpretation was backed by the meaning given to the term 'contraceptive' by the Supreme Court in the Magee case. I suggest that the Minister for Health and Deputy De Rossa have been attempting to confuse the public more by what they have been saying. We can see clearly who has been creating the confusion. The Fianna Fáil form of words is clear and unambiguous and would copperfasten within our Constitution the right to life of the unborn from the time of fertilisation and would also copperfasten the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn child. Amazingly, prior to the election of November 1982, Fine Gael clearly and unequivocally accepted this form of wording. Unfortunately, now, some months later, after their election success, the present Taoiseach is prepared to renege on his promises and his commitment.;2071531

There is no question of a mother [2216] with such a pregnancy being allowed to die if the amendment with our form of wording is introduced, any more than there is any danger of any pregnant woman with any condition, whether it be leukaemia, or cancer of the womb, being left untreated because she is pregnant.;2071618

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;, Limerick East): I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate here today. I am sorry that, to a large extent, it seemed to be a re-run of the Second Stage debate rather than Committee Stage. In particular I thank Deputy O'Kennedy because he made an attempt to render it a Committee Stage debate. He raised three points at the end which were not answered and I should like to answer them. He asked if the text I am proposing gives constitutional protection. Only where the provision prohibits all abortions, not for example under section 58 of the 1861 Act which appears to permit some. I think that is the point he was making. The advice I had from the Attorney General was that he saw no reason to give the text this narrow meaning. A second point Deputy O'Kennedy raised was on the meaning of the word 'abortion' in the context of procured or spontaneous abortion. The word 'prohibit' would quite clearly suggest here that what we are talking about is procured abortion because obviously one could not prohibit spontaneous abortion. Deputy O'Kennedy asked also what does the word 'it' in the English text refer back to, was it to a law or a provision of the law? If he looks at the Irish version of the text he will see that there the [2219] translation of 'it' is 'si' and it quite obviously refers back to 'foráil' in that context rather than to the law itself. If the Deputy looks at the Irish version it is obvious it refers to a provision rather than to the law itself. Deputy Woods made the major contribution from the Opposition side. I posed some questions when I was introducing the wording this morning. Since the amendment I am proposing as Minister for Justice substitutes for wording in the Bill I think that has put Deputy Woods in the position in which in effect he is sponsoring the original wording. I asked him some questions about the original wording and I am sorry he did not clarify them. Deputy Woods is now Opposition spokesman on Justice. But, I understand, when the wording was published, he was Minister for Health and the responsibility for introducing this Bill in the previous administration lay with the Minister for Health and the Department of Health, not with the Department of Justice. I am surprised that, on his memory of events, if he did not have the documentation available, he would not have been able to carry out an analysis and defence of the wording in the original Bill. He failed to do that and I wonder why.;2071636

685;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East): Why could he not answer the questions I [2220] raised? As far as I can gather, in general, Deputy Woods has taken the line, in much the same words on different occasions, that there is no problem about the existing wording. He wrote about it recently in The Cork Examiner of 20 April 1983 and something similar appears in today's newspapers. The opening part of his argument is that none of the personal rights of the citizen is absolute or unlimited and that their exercise may be regulated by the State. He goes on to say that the original wording does not create an absolute or unlimited guarantee for the life of the unborn but specifically acknowledges the equal right to life of the mother. The laws of the State, he says, may therefore provide for the exercise of that right when it is threatened and if a mother's life is threatened by illness she is constitutionally entitled to appropriate medical treatment even if such treatment would result in the termination of her pregnancy. That is the line of argument Deputy Woods followed today in the early part of his contribution. I should like to look at that argument. The first point made is that the State has the right to regulate the exercise of personal rights. I think a question could be raised immediately as to how the word 'exercise' could be applied at all to the right to life—one would not normally think of the process of living as the exercise of a right to life. But, leaving that aside, it is quite clear that if one speaks about the State regulating the exercise of a right one is talking about some form of restriction on its exercise. I come now to the next part of the argument where it says that the wording acknowledges the equal right to life of the mother and that the laws of the State may therefore provide for the exercise of that right when it is threatened. In sharp contrast to the opening statement the Deputy goes on to talk about regulating, about providing for the exercise of a right, that is facilitating or allowing for it, which is almost the opposite of restricting it. I cannot understand the logic of the Deputy's positions, where he has moved from one side of the argument to the other in the early part of his contribution this morning. Apart from that, the suggestion [2221] that it is permissible for the laws of the State to provide for the exercise of a constitutional right is a rather strange one, the reality being, of course, that the laws of the State must allow for the exercise of such rights. Having made those introductory propositions—the meaning of which, as I have indicated, is open to considerable doubt—Deputy Woods then went on to make the assertion that if a mother's life was threatened by illness she would be constitutionally entitled to appropriate medical treatment even if such treatment would result in the termination of her pregnancy. I am afraid I have to say very plainly that that assertion is no more than an assertion, unsustained by any argument whatsoever because the statements that preceded it are irrelevant to the conclusion. That is why I objected to the fact that we had a Second Stage speech from Deputy Woods in which he concluded with an assertion to which the arguments did not lead. I must ask those who are so completely happy about the present wording to face the real questions. Nobody suggests that the wording gives to the unborn child an unqualified right to life. Of course it does not. But it does acknowledge a right to life which, on the wording, the State is obliged to uphold in equal measure with that of the mother. There is no point in saying that that obligation is qualified by the words 'as far as practicable' and that that is why those words were included. Those words had to be included because they are already in Article 40. 3.1º. Even if they had been included for the purpose stated, it does not follow that they are sufficient or even relevant. The issue is not practicability. It is 'practicable' for the law to forbid such operations. Such a law would be indefensible and outregeous but not impracticable'. We are therefore back to the stark question whether the carrying out of such an operation can be reconciled with the specific words of the original text which, I must repeat, requires that the right to life of the unborn be upheld in equal measure with that of the mother. The difficulty that has been raised is that, where such an operation is carried out, [2222] necessary and legitimate and laudable though it be, the right to life of the unborn is not being upheld and it is not sufficient for anybody to say that the mother has a constitutional right to protect her life if in fact the Constitution is expressing, without any qualifications whatsoever, an equal right for the foetus. It is very easy to be misunderstood on an issue like this. I am very well aware of the fact that people's thinking in this respect can be influenced by the fact that they believe that the right to life in both cases is intrinsically equal. It is no part of the case that I am making that the wording should express a different principle. In my view it does not need to do so but I continue to believe that, if it is to express with clarity what its sponsors intended to mean, then, without purporting to express any principle on the matter, it should have acknowledged that in certain circumstances certain forms of intervention would not be unlawful—that is to say, that the law of the State would not intervene to stop such interventions. That would involve no statement of basic principle as to the respective values of the two lives and therefore no conflict with basic principles which very many people hold as sacred. It is so well known as scarcely to merit repeating that there are many things which, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, have been universally regarded as wrong but which, for good and sufficient reasons, the law of the State does not declare to be unlawful. I am afraid, therefore, that what Deputy Woods has said does not answer the questions I have raised. What he has said does not really face the questions at all. I was very disappointed with him in this respect this morning. I think I am entitled to inquire if the Deputy bothered to listen to or to read what the questions were. He alleged here today that one of my questions was a fundamental one about whether we should have a Constitution and what we should have in it. I said nothing, by way of question or otherwise, remotely like that. He said I asked what was the position of the State in relation to protecting fundamental rights and went on to comment that the killing of the unborn is an issue affecting the [2223] secular and social order of the State as if I had suggested the contrary. I put no such question and, far from denying that abortion affects the secular and social order, I would regard it as so self-evidently true as not to need saying. The Deputy refers me to a document by Professor Walter Murphy of Princeton as if in some way I had expressed some different opinion, and tells the House, by way of explanation, that I asked for some relevant references. A script of my remarks was circulated and can be checked. There is not a word in it about my seeking relevant references.;2071640

Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East): I asked the Deputy questions but he evaded them by answering questions that I did not put. If the Deputy as Minister sponsored the original text, he should be prepared to explain it to the House, as I have explained our amendment. The simple fact, as I have said, is that the questions I put have not been faced. There is no point in telling us that similar language is used in the Constitution to express and regulate a whole host of other rights. We are all aware of that. But the relationship of mother and unborn child is unique in its intimacy. Nowhere else, as far as I know, does the law have to cater for a situation where something may be done to save one life in the certain knowledge that it will lead to the loss of another life. That, fundamentally, is why wording that is quite acceptable in ordinary situations can cause problems here. I repeat my question. Why did the text take a form that, at best, clearly calls for a considerable degree of interpretation when its intended meaning could have been stated clearly? I do not understand that. I can see that what concerns people here today more than anything else is the question of the respective rights of the mother and child. Deputy Woods admits that the word 'unborn' is ambiguous and vague but to a large degree he has repeated what he said on Second Stage, [2224] that was, that despite what undoubtedly would have been the wishes of the promoters of this amendment and of the majority Church on this island, there is no attempt in the wording of the amendment to define the moment at which the life of the unborn begins. He went on to say that most would argue that life beings at the time of conception but that this is a matter of theological and scientific argument and that in preparing the wording of the amendment Fianna Fáil considered it was not appropriate to the Constitution to have such definitions. In effect that means that there was a failure to take a decision as to when the protection of the unborn life should commence and that Fianna Fáil were leaving it to the courts to decide that matter. In so far as Deputy Woods answered the questions at all he said on Second Stage that he purposely allowed the wording to be ambiguous because he wanted it to be ambiguous.;2071642

690;An Bille um an Ocht&uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Coiste (At&oacute g&aacute il) agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh . Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages;27.04.83;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East): If this had been a normal Committee Stage debate, the Minister would have been on his feet several times today but the debate did not proceed on those lines. I am picking up the main points made by the Opposition and which are relevant to the words before us. Deputy Woods made a major contribution. I am not misquoting him. He says that the word 'unborn' is used without qualification as a matter of policy so that it might be interpreted subsequently. Will it be interpreted as meaning from the point of fertilisation, as from the point of implantation or from the point when the foetus develops a brain? I do not know what decision the Supreme Court would reach in that regard. I am [2225] only saying that Fianna Fáil wish to have enshrined in the Constitution an amendment which the person who put it forward in the first place is declaring to be unfair. Clearly it is possible to draft an amendment which gives a right to the unborn and which also provides that intervention necessary to save the life of a mother need not be unlawful. For some policy reason a choice was taken not to go along those lines. I have answered the points raised and I have expressed the effect of the amendment I am proposing. I am not sponsoring the amendment put forward by Fianna Fáil but that party have failed to deal with the points raised on this side of the House throughout this debate. There is one point on which I would agree largely with Deputy Woods. He expressed the hope that this debate would not become sectarian. In a small country such as ours it would be regrettable if a debate about something so fundamental were to be sectarian. However, even something trivial could become sectarian if Churches took opposing views on it or continued to argue on opposing sides. The debate in question was not sectarian at the beginning but there is grave danger now, if we are not already into that area, that we are approaching a stage where there is a sectarian dimension. I appeal to Deputies on all sides at least from this point forward to cool the situation in that respect so that we may not become involved in a divisive and sectarian debate that would divide the [2226] country in the course of a referendum campaign. Finally, I should like to say that the amendment I am putting forward tonight substitutes completely for the original wording. What Deputies will be doing when they are voting on my amendment is that they will not only be voting for my amendment but against the words already in the Bill. It is proposed on this side of the House that that will be the test for one or the other. We will vote on it in the clear knowledge that we are voting for the amendment I am proposing and, at the same time, voting against the original wording. Beyond that we do not propose to vote and, depending on what happens in the vote, we will not obstruct the passage of the Bill further.;2071645

693;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Tairgim: 'Go léifear an Bille an Dara Uair.' I move: 'That the Bill be now read a Second Time.' Each Bill proposes to amend subsection 3 of section 3 of Article 40 of the Constitution and their combined effect would be to deal with the various issues that arise from the decision of the Supreme Court in Attorney General .v. X and some other Supreme Court decisions on Article 40. 3.3º in so far as it relates to provision of information. There is no human right more fundamental [1894] or more important than the right to life. There is a long and proud tradition here which regards the right to life as belonging to the unborn as well as to those who have been born. This respect for the sanctity of unborn human life was enshrined in Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution in 1983 by referendum of the people. The provision declares that: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its law to defend and vindicate that right. Prior to 1983 abortion was, of course, prohibited here by section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which makes it an offence to unlawfully use any means with intent to procure a miscarriage. Section 58 is still the relevant provision of our criminal law. If one were to try to summarise what was the purpose which those who proposed and voted for the amendment of the Constitution in 1983 had in mind, one could perhaps put it most succinctly by saying that the amendment was designed to preserve the prohibition on unlawful abortion contained in the 1861 Act. In its decision in the X case on 5 March of this year the Supreme Court gave its interpretation of Article 40. 3.3º on both the substantive issue of abortion and on the right to travel out of the State to have an abortion. The effect of the decision on the substantive issue is that termination of pregnancy is permissible in the State where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by such termination and that a risk of suicide may constitute a real and substantial risk. That is the test laid down by the Supreme Court. The court also decided by a three to two majority that, while an injunction will not be given to restrain a woman from travelling abroad to obtain an abortion where there is a real and substantial risk to her life, such an injunction can be [1895] given to restrain travel abroad to obtain an abortion where there is no such risk. The issue of information and counselling did not come before the Supreme Court in the X case but in previous cases that court decided that the dissemination of information on abortion is unlawful having regard to Article 40. 3.3º. One effect of the decision in the X case appears to be that it is not unlawful to communicate information to women who would be entitled to a termination of pregnancy under the decision. The decision has generated a very wide debate and concern about its implications. Initially, much of the debate focused on the implications of the decision for Protocol No. 17 to the draft Maastricht Treaty. The reason that Protocol had been written into the Treaty was that, since EC law takes precedence over any conflicting provision of the Constitution, there were fears that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 40. 3.3º, abortion might be imposed on this country under EC law. To meet those fears Protocol No. 17 was annexed to the Maastricht Treaty. I will be coming back to Protocol No. 17 later on. The Government took immediate action to address the issues raised by the decision in the X case. On 10 March 1992 a Cabinet sub-committee was established under my chairmanship of examine the implications of the judgment. The Government subsequently decided, on 10 April 1992, that a referendum should be held on the right to travel and the right to information, covering not only EC citizens and countries but all persons and countries, and that the other issues arising from the Supreme Court's judgment would be considered for legislation and/or referendum depending on the Government's decision on recommendations of the sub-committees. On 9 June 1992, prior to the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty the party leaders of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats subscribed to a statement to the following effect: [1896] All the Leaders who have signed this statement agree that the right to information, appropriately regulated by law, and to travel will be copperfastened in a further Referendum in the autumn. Legislative and/or Constitutional changes arising from the Supreme Court decision on Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution will be placed before the Dáil by the Government as soon as is practicable and, in any case, by the autumn. Before going on to deal with the Bills, individually, I wish at the outset to give a brief outline of the effect of each Bill. I shall be dealing at some length with the complexities of the issues involved later in my contribution. The first point I want to make about the amendment proposed in the Twelfth Amendment Bill is that it will leave undisturbed the existing affirmative acknowledgement in Article 40. 3.3º of the right to life of the unborn, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother. The amendment will be an addition to the existing Article 40. 3.3, not a substitution for it. The effect of the amendment is to afford full protection to the lives of pregnant women. Under the amendment, where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is endangered if the pregnancy continues, the pregnancy may be lawfully terminated, if that is necessary to save her life. The amendment therefore accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in every respect except suicide.;2625670

695;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;It negatives the decision in respect of suicide but in no other respect. The proposal in the Thirteenth Amendment Bill would ensure that Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution cannot in future be invoked to prevent a woman travelling abroad, whatever the purpose of her journey. Likewise, the proposal in the Fourteenth Amendment Bill would ensure [1897] that Article 40. 3.3º cannot in future be invoked, as it was in a number of recent cases, to prevent the dissemination, in accordance with conditions to be laid down by law, of information about services lawfully available in another state. The particular service which we are talking about here is, of course, abortion. The substantive issue, which is dealt with in the Twelfth Amendment Bill, is the one that clearly has attracted most controversy and debate. Before dealing in some detail with this amendment I think it is only right to place on the record of this House the Government's appreciation of the willingness of other parties in the House to endeavour to achieve a consensus on how best to approach this matter. Unfortunately, that consensus did not prove possible but I believe that the process of trying to achieve it at the very least threw some light on the many complexities involved. To the extent that there are some who support, in effect, abortion on demand, clearly there never was a prospect of consensus with them. What is being proposed on this issue is the insertion into Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution of the following additional wording: It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction. As Deputies will be only too well aware, this wording has been strongly criticised by groups who stand at either end of the debate on this difficult, complex and controversial subject. I hope to persuade the House and the people of our country that the more extreme views expressed on either side of the debate should be rejected and that the amendment now being proposed should be accepted as a moderate and balanced response to the problem presented. The effect of the Supreme Court's decision was to permit termination of [1898] pregnancy where there is real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by such termination and that a risk of self-destruction may constitute a real and substantial risk. The amendment reflects this test in every respect except that it excludes a risk of self-destruction. The Government do not regard it as acceptable that such a risk should be available as grounds for termination of pregnancy. There is considerable room for subjective judgement in assessing whether a risk of suicide exists and the availability of such a ground for termination would carry the danger of opening the way to widescale abortion. It is quite clear that the experience in other countries has been that grounds for abortion related to health, physical or mental, lead to abortion on demand. Otherwise, the test laid down by the Supreme Court is being retained. Under the amendment all treatments necessary to save the life of an expectant mother will be allowed. Her entitlement to have her right to life vindicated will be safeguarded. The constitutional right to life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother conferred by Article 40. 3.3º is not being diminished. Intervention affecting the life of the unborn is only justified where it is necessary to save the life of the mother. The importance which the Government attach to the need to protect the life of the mother is the reason we have not been able to accept the amendment put forward by the Pro-Life campaign. That amendment seeks to confine the possibility of termination of pregnancy to situations where it is the indirect or unsought side-effect of treatment necessary to save the mother's life. In proposing their formula the Government were conscious of the fact that, apart from terminations arising in cases such as cancer of the uterus, ectopic pregnancy and treatment of breast cancer, there are other life-threatening illnesses, either associated with pregnancy or exacerbated by pregnancy, in which the need to take action involving termination [1899] of the pregnancy to save the woman's life may have to be considered. This is where the Government differs from the pro-life groups. These groups are prepared to say, and have said repeatedly, that there are no medical conditions, without any exception whatsoever, in which what they call a 'direct' termination is necessary. They speak as if there was total unanimity among all doctors and all medical specialists on this issue, but that clearly is not the case. Writing in The Irish Times on 16 October the Chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stated that in a survey of their membership carried out last April a substantial minority felt that there were rare cases in which, because of the risk to the mother's life, direct termination of pregnancy was medically indicated. In The Irish Times of 12 October, an eminent cardiologist was reported as saying the following: In the practice of cardiology over the past 30 years I have seen women whose lives would undoubtedly have been endangered had their pregnancies been allowed to go full term and I can state that unequivocally. Speaking on the radio on 12 October the President of the IMO stated that there were differing views among their members on this question. In the face of comments like these and others, how can anybody reasonably demand of the Government that no account should be taken of the possibility, however remote, that termination of pregnancy may be necessary to save life in the case of the other life-threatening conditions I have mentioned. Neither the Government nor anybody else who supports the proposed amendment has said that these life-threatening conditions occur frequently or are common. They are rare conditions but they cannot be ignored, especially when we are framing a constitutional amendment.;2625672

697;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;I emphasise this is a distinction never properly teased out in the High Court hearing or in the Supreme Court judgments. Neither has it been properly teased out by the Government. It is a distinction which should not be contained in this constitutional provision. Listening to recent comments by Ministers, I cannot help but speculate as to whether this distinction is there for political [1928] as opposed to sound legal and health reasons. I suspect its inclusion is something of a political trojan horse and my suspicions have been heightened by the Minister's comments this afternoon. It is there so that it can be suggested by way of an action replay of the type of discredited approach we saw from Fianna Fáil in 1983 that those Opposition parties who wish to have it removed are in some way 'soft' on abortion. Statements by Ministers that the exclusion of this phrase 'as distinct from the health of the mother' could allow for easy abortion or abortion on demand should be taken with a grain of salt. The observations of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in the X case in this context are worth noting, where he stated that under the existing constitutional provision, unamended: 'Abortion on demand, is not something that can be legalised in this jurisdiction'. There should be no provision in our Constitution which raises any doubt as to the right of a woman to obtain treatment where circumstances arise that there is a probable risk to her life. There is currently confusion and differences among members of the medical profession as to how they will apply this provision if it becomes part of our constitutional law. As is frequently said: 'when doctors differ, patients die'. In this instance, it can be said: 'when doctors differ, women will die'.;2625674
698;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;And have died.;2625675
699;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;I wish to refer to the issue of suicide. Part of the rationale for the government's wording is to exclude suicide or a threat of suicide as allowing for the termination of a pregnancy. There is real and substantial concern that if a threat of suicide continued to be a general basis for the termination of pregnancy we would have in this country general abortion or abortion on demand. This is based on the supposition that it is impossible to properly administer a law or a constitutional provision which allows for terminations in such circumstances and is based on the assumption that it would not merely be open to abuse but would [1929] be grossly abused. The Fine Gael Party would have substantial concerns if the law as it applies with regard to suicide was to remain unchanged following the decision in the X case. In dealing with the issue of suicide, however, the Government have simply made a policy decision that no threat or risk of suicide should ever allow for the termination of a pregnancy and have assumed that if any exceptions to this were to become part of our law, no legislation could be enacted to ensure protection against abuse. However, in a bizarre twist to this approach we are told we are to see legislation that the Government might introduce if the referendum on this Article is unsuccessful. There are countries where mental ill health and threats of suicide can result in pregnancies being terminated which have legislation which, in practice, works to prevent abuse and widescale abortion. There are other countries which have such legislation and where there is, in effect, abortion on demand, something I believe no one in this House wants to see. Some of this legislation and its application in practice is reviewed in a recent paper published by Professor Anthony Clare and Dr. J. Tyrrell. Such legislation can be drafted competently and can work or can be drafted incompetently and be unworkable. The bona fides of the Government in their approach to this area will be clearly seen when their promised legislation is published. However, it is extraordinary that the Government are able to draft legislation to detail how the law will apply if their referendum wording is unsuccessful but are unable and unwilling to prepare legislation on how it will apply if the referendum is successful. There are legitimate fears that threats of suicide as a ground for abortion could give rise to widespread abortion of a nature that would be anathema to the overwhelming majority of people in this country. Fine Gael share these fears. However, the Government have an obligation not to lose sight of the very real problem illustrated by the X case. In that case evidence was given that the tragic [1930] young victim of rape was suicidal and no contrary evidence was called on behalf of the State. Presumably the State called no such evidence because the Attorney General accepted the truth of what the psychologist told the court. If the Attorney General did not, it is extraordinary that the psychologist's evidence was not seriously challenged. At this stage in the debate we are entitled to ask the Government what consultations, if any, they engaged in with professional psychiatrists and psychologists who have experience in dealing with young girls and women who are the victims of sexual abuse, sexual assault and rape and who as a result have become pregnant. As the Government are sponsoring this legislation, it is their duty and responsibility to further explain their approach to such tragic cases. No mention has been made by the Government of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under Article 2 of that convention it is stated 'Everyone's right to life should be protected by law'. I ask the Minister to tell the House whether the Government consider the Article they now propose be included in the Constitution protects a woman's right to life under this convention. Has this issue been examined in any detail by the Government? No mention of this convention was made by the Minister in his speech. I suspect it is not an issue that has been addressed in any great detail by the Government in their considerations in bringing forward this proposal. The difficulties associated with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill should not have to be solely addressed in a guillotined debate in the sole context of a constitutional proposal, the contents of which have only been in the public domain for 14 days. It is the view of the Fine Gael Party that prior to a referendum being held on the substantive issue, detailed legislation addressing the difficulties involved should have been brought before this House for discussion by the Government. There is no reason such legislation could not have been brought before this House. Why is it that the Government have taken the view [1931] there is a need for such approach prior to a referendum in relation to divorce but no need for such an approach prior to this referendum? If the Minister for Health is able to produce a draft of proposed legislation with regard to the issue of information, the Government should have been able to produce a draft of legislation addressing issues they now, apparently, intend to ignore in regard to this substantive problem. There are, of course, other areas of genuine concern which are being ignored. An area of genuine concern to the medical profession and to women totally ignored by Government relates to a woman pregnant with a foetus that is anencephalic — without a brain. There are about 40 such pregnancies annually and they are easily detectable during the early weeks of pregnancy. A foetus so born cannot and does not survive. There is a universal view in the medical profession that it should be possible within the law to terminate such pregnancies, that it is an unacceptable cruelty to require a pregnant woman to carry such a pregnancy to full term. This is yet another area of difficulty that is being ignored in the context of the Government's proposal and has, I assume, never been considered by them. Because of the difficulties involved in this area it cannot be properly addressed in two or three sentences in our Constitution. In regard to the right to travel and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, it appears that all sides in this debate agree that the right of a woman to travel abroad should not be impeded by constitutional constraints deriving from the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. In the X case a majority of the court expressed the view that where there was no real and substantial risk to the life of the mother and if she intended to go abroad to terminate her pregnancy, the courts could grant an injunction to prevent such termination. The effect of the Government's proposal is understood to mean that no injunctions can be obtained in the future to prevent a pregnant [1932] woman travelling abroad whether or not she intends to obtain an abortion. The vision that the X case threw up, of pregnant women being effectively imprisoned in Ireland during the course of their pregnancy even alarmed extremist groups such as that fronted by Mr. William Binchy. The alarm, I suspect, was more due to it being seen as a public relations own goal rather than out of any concern for women's rights to freedom of travel. Of course, it is the freedom of women to travel which until the X case allowed us to evade addressing many of the difficult and substantial issues concerning abortion and allowed certain groups to maintain the facade that this country is an abortion-free zone. The irrelevance of the Eighth Amendment in preventing abortion can be seen from the statistical figures referred to earlier which show that while in 1983, 3,000 Irish women per year approximately had abortions in England, by 1991 the figure was in excess of 4,000 — an increase of 25 per cent. The proposed Thirteenth Amendment, of course, also allows for a young girl or woman who is truly suicidal and who is regarded as such by her Irish psychiatrist or psychologist and who is denied an abortion in Ireland to go to England to obtain an abortion. The Health (Family Planning) Act of 1979 was stated at the time to be an Irish solution to an Irish problem. The Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992 together with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, is in effect, an English solution to an Irish problem. For many it will highlight the hypocritical and politically schizophrenic approach we take to difficult social issues. In many Supreme Court judgments, including the judgement delivered in the X case, members of that court have emphasised that the Preamble to the Constitution records that the Constitution seeks to promote the common good 'with due observance of prudence, justice and charity'. The practical interaction between the Twelfth and Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment Bills [1933] now for the first time elevates hypocrisy to the level of a constitutional principle worthy of promotion together with the principles of prudence, justice and charity. The provisions of this Bill are welcome. However, it is unsatisfactory that the legislation that the Bill envisages has not yet been published by the Government. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Health is to tell the House the draft proposals. If he has draft proposals, they should have been published well in advance of this debate so that reasonable consideration could be given to their implications by Members of this House. In regard to information and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, prior to the judgement in the X case, the principal impact of the Eighth Amendment was a series of court cases brought by SPUC against student groups and other agencies who were providing non-directive counselling to pregnant women which included information about pregnancy termination. This whole area — as did the travel area — became further complicated as a result of the Irish Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and the subsequent solemn declaration entered into in respect of that Treaty. In the court cases that ensued it was held that information could not be given to Irish women with regard to the obtaining of abortions outside Ireland and the Bill is intended to allow the making available of such information. There are many people of the view that the restraint on information has had a negative effect, that if Irish women seeking abortion abroad first felt free to obtain counselling at home, some at least might, after all the options had been explained to them, decide not to proceed to obtain an abortion. It is also extraordinary that the Government are intent on pushing the referendum Bill through all Stages in this House prior to the judgement of the European Court in the Open Door Counselling Limited and the Dublin Well Woman Centre Limited cases, which is scheduled to be delivered on 29 October next. It is totally illogical to finalise this [1934] referendum Bill while the contents of this judgement remain unknown. For far too long we have dealt with this whole area from a narrow and negative perspective. For far too long in debates such as this both inside and outside this House, men and talked about women in an offensive and unacceptable way, what Frances FitzGerald, the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women has graphically referred to as 'a disembodied debate about women's bodies'. For far too long we have played constitutional and political games with women's lives and the lives of the unborn. Far too often in debates such as this, we lose sight of the fact that women do not conceive alone, that for every difficult and unwanted pregnancy a man shares the responsibility. It has never been acknowledged in this House that without men there would be no abortions. The overwhelming majority of people on this island are opposed to abortion but there is also now, I believe, a recognition that simplistic constitutional solutions or formulae do not and cannot provide the answer. There is a need to take positive action, in so far as that is possible, to eliminate those circumstances that result in abortion in the first place. The judges of the Supreme Court in the X case recognised this. Mr. Justice O'Flaherty referring to the responsibility of the executive branch of Government, spoke of the positive thrust of Article 40. 3.3º saying: 'The State should provide every practical assistance to pregnant women who find themselves unwillingly in that situation to help them make a decision which is in accordance with the Constitution.' The late Mr. Justice McCarthy referring to the Eighth Amendment, stated: Since the Amendment contemplates lawful abortion, how may the State still, as far as practicable, vindicate the right to life of the unborn? Legislation may be both negative and positive: negative in prohibiting absolutely or at a given time, or without meeting stringent tests positive by requiring positive action. The State may fulfil its [1935] role by providing necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort, to plan for the pregnant woman, the pregnant girl or her family. It is not for the courts to programme society that is partly, at least, the role of the Legislature. The courts are not equipped to regulate these procedures. The State has, of course, never enacted legislation to provide a comprehensive positive action programme such as the Article envisages. That has largely been left to voluntary agencies, some of which over the years have been persecuted and vilified by extreme groups. Tragically, the Government are ignoring this aspect of the Supreme Court judgement and by refusing to provide the comprehensive legislation required, are abdicating their constitutional duty to take positive action. If the Government were truly pro-life and if they truly wished to reduce the numbers of Irish women who are currently having abortions, there would be a positive action programme being presented to this House. Positive action is required if not the numbers of Irish women having abortions will continue to increase. We need determined action to reduce the level of sexual crime, better family planning services with health boards accepting their full responsibilities, comprehensive sex education and education for life in our schools and the strengthening of services offering care, support, counselling and information into all aspects of pregnancy. Such action would inevitably reduce the current demand for abortion very considerably. No such action, sadly, is envisaged by this Government. The Government intend to push the three referenda Bills through this House with obscene haste. It is the view of the Fine Gael Party that a more considered and detailed approach is required. It is a mystery to everyone in the country outside the ranks of Fianna Fáil why the Taoiseach has irrevocably fixed 3 December next as the date by which the referenda must be held. The Government should postpone the [1936] passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas and the holding of the proposed referenda until all of the legislation necessary is published and until Members of this House have an opportunity to consider it in detailed debate. The Government, at least the Fianna Fáil wing of Government, should stop playing political games with a difficult and serious issue that deserves better and more detailed consideration. The people of this country deserve better than they now have on offer. I move amendment No. 3: To delete 'now' and add at the end of the motion the words 'on 15 January, 1993 or on such earlier date as may be determined by the Dáil, after the Dáil had first discussed, up to and including Committee Stage, legislation designed to elaborate on the practical implementation of the provisions of this Bill'. I hope the Government will take seriously this motion, that they will slow down in bringing this legislation to a completion and allow for more reasoned, detailed and considered discussion. I hope, too, that in the context of that discussion the dismissive attitude adopted in 1983 by members of Fianna Fáil to other parties and Members of this House who expressed concern at the constitutional proposal that we eventually included in our Constitution, will be given more consideration than was apparent from the approach taken by the Minister for Justice to this issue in the House this evening. We shall be moving also, at the appropriate time, similar amendments to the other two Bills.;2625676

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Pro-life groups make much of the distinction between 'direct' and 'indirect' termination mainly on the basis that an indirect termination is an unintended effect of other treatment. It seems to me that this distinction could not serve as the basis for a constitutional provision on this subject. It is difficult to see how it can be maintained, for example, that in removing a cancerous womb there is no intention of terminating the life of the foetus when that result is clearly foreseen from the very outset and is inevitable. As a matter of law foreseen consequences of an act are, of course, intended. If our law was that only so-called 'indirect' terminations were permitted, how would that affect new treatment methods for ectopic pregnancy which apparently 'directly' remove the foetus from the fallopian tube? Surely it is not being suggested that this treatment should be made unlawful, but would that not be the effect of a provision which would permit only 'indirect' terminations? Another difficulty in replying on the 'direct'/'indirect' distinction is that these concepts do not always seem to mean the same thing to different people. I have heard it argued publicly by a Pro-Life spokesperson within the past couple of weeks that the new form of treatment for ectopic pregnancy is, in fact, indirect termination of the life of the foetus. Indeed it can even be argued that it is difficult to see how any operation, the sole purpose of which is to save the life of the mother, could be regarded as a direct killing of the foetus. On that criterion any intervention permitted by the Twelfth Amendment Bill would be indirect. The Government are satisfied that a distinction between so-called 'direct' and 'indirect' termination cannot be written into the law without threatening existing medical practice, particularly in the case of ectopic pregnancies. The Government's proposal is clear and straightforward and will not prevent what is necessary from being done in our hospitals to save the lives of mothers as [1901] is done at present. To introduce such a distinction into the amendment would be to introduce confusion and uncertainty for doctors, their patients and the courts and this is something which the Government cannot accept. In the Government's view the only acceptable test is whether the action is necessary to save the life of the mother and the question of whether the action needed for that purpose constitutes direct or indirect termination is beside the point and, in any event, is not capable of an unequivocal answer in all situations. What we are proposing here is that a provision be inserted in our fundamental law — the Constitution — that is likely to remain unaltered for the foreseeable future. In that situation we must do all we can to get the provision right and we would be failing in our duty to women and to their entitlement to protection where there is a risk to their life if we refused to take account of the fact that cases may arise, however infrequently, where the woman's life would be endangered by continuation of the pregnancy. If there were to be only one case in one million, or even ten or more million, we would have to take account of it. There is a duty on all of use to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken.;2625678

703;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;There is no warrant whatsoever for any suggestion that the amendment will open the door to abortion. It is most emphatically not an abortion amendment. Far from making the law concerning abortion more permissive, as some people are wrongly suggesting, the amendment will have exactly the opposite effect: it will prohibit abortion in circumstances where it is now permitted without disturbing existing medical practice and without putting mothers' lives at risk. It is a provision that arises from a woman's entitlement to protection where there is a risk to her life and it [1902] enshrines that protection. I would submit that in all conscience we could do no less than we are doing. The Government's proposal ought to satisfy the concerns of all of those who wish the law of the land to protect the life of the unborn in Ireland. It would be a tragedy for the unborn if the amendment were to be defeated in the forthcoming referendum by a combination of those who do not wish the unborn to be protected by the law — i. e. who in greater or lesser degree favour permitting abortion in this country — and certain misguided persons on the Pro-Life side who seem to be blind to the merits of the amendment from their own point of view. I do not think, either, that there is any basis for suggesting that the test whereby a termination is permissible where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother is out of line with what our law was even before the X case. First, the 1861 Act which prohibits abortion does not contain a blanket prohibition. What it prohibits is 'unlawful' abortion. The use of the word 'unlawful' has from the beginning given rise to the view that the act envisaged that there were circumstances in which the termination of a pregnancy was legally permissible and the general view always seems to have been that termination necessary to save the life of the mother was legally permissible. If therefore a case had come for decision by the courts solely by reference to the 1861 Act, it seems highly probable that a termination of pregnancy in those circumstances would have been allowed. Secondly, our Constitution provides in Articles 40. 3.1º and 2º an explicit guarantee to protect and vindicate the right to life of all persons, including, of course, expectant mothers. It is reasonable to suggest that if a court had to choose between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the foetus, that explicit constitutional guarantee would impel the court to save the life of the mother. Judge O'Flaherty in the X case intimated that the court would have come to the same decision, even if Article 40. 3.3º did not exist. [1903] Thirdly, even considering Article 40. 3.3º, it seems to me that the provision, looked at critically, inevitably raises, as the Supreme Court recognised, the question of what happens when there is a conflict between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the foetus. That is a question which most people, in common with the Supreme Court, will agree should be answered in favour of the mother. Leaving aside the suicide aspect, the substance of the Supreme Court decision is, in my view, fully in line with preexisting law and I imagine is widely acceptable. That is why the proposed amendment reproduces the substance of the decision.;2625680

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I hope that when I explain the reason for its inclusion it will not be seen in that light. The phrase reflects the Supreme Court decision in so far as it provides that the risk must be to the life of the mother in the sense that, unless the risk is avoided, she would die. The phrase is taken from the Chief Justice's judgment but it is clear that the other judges also had in mind a risk to life rather than a risk to health. The reality which we cannot ignore is that in other jurisdictions risk of damage to health is the ground which has led to widescale abortion on demand. It is in order to prevent that situation developing here that the phrase is included in the amendment. Some doctors have expressed concern that the inclusion of the phrase 'as distinct from the health' could have the effect of restricting a certain flexibility which under current medical practice doctors are permitted to exercise in the [1904] best interests of the patient. It is suggested that in any medical condition there is a spectrum of gravity and it is impossible to identify a precise point at which the risk changes from a risk to health to a risk to life. The concern of the doctors involved seems to be that the wording may result in their being forced to have a greater degree of certainty about the risk to the mother's life before providing treatment which may result in the loss of the foetus — whereas normal medical practice cannot operate on the basis of certainty but only on the basis of probability.;2625684

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I think that I can provide reassurance on this point. The intention of the amendment is that a risk to health unrelated to a risk to life is not sufficient to warrant termination of the life of the unborn. It is not the intention of the amendment to affect in any way the degree of probability of risk to life that is necessary to warrant treatment resulting in termination. In the X case the Supreme Court laid down the test as being a real and substantial risk to the mother's life arising as a matter of probability. There is nothing in the proposed wording which would change that. I want to allay fears which have been expressed by some that the use of the word 'as distinct from the health' in the amendment might result in pregnant women being denied necessary medical treatment to protect their health. There is no basis for such fears. Under the amendment women will continue to receive all necessary medical treatment to protect their health. Current medical practice in this regard will not be affected. Under current medical practice the question of termination of pregnancy only arises where there is a threat to the mother's life. After all, the amendment does no more than adopt the test laid down in this regard by the Supreme Court in the X case and there has been no suggestion that medical practice regarding necessary treatment to protect [1905] women's health has been affected in any way since that decision. The suggestion that the words 'as distinct from the health' should be omitted from the proposed amendment really boils down to this — that it should be possible to terminate the life of an unborn child where there is no risk to the life of the mother. Let there be no doubt about one thing. The amendment as it stands will allow all necessary treatment to be provided for an expectant mother, even if it would result in the loss of the life of her unborn child, in all circumstances where her life is at risk. There is no basis whatsoever for any suggestion that the amendment we are proposing here today will leave a woman without protection in any situation where her life is endangered. The clear intent of the amendment and the clear meaning of the words it uses in that medical intervention will be allowed in all situations where it is necessary to save the mother's life because of a life-threatening physical, medical condition that she is suffering from.;2625686

As I speak in this debate I want to make it abundantly clear, despite what has been said about me on many occasions, both in my constituency and elsewhere since 1983, that I speak as a pro-life leader of the oldest pro-life party in this State. It is from that perspective, and that perspective alone, that I and the Labour Party reject the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution Bill — the so-called 'substantive issue' amendment — in its entirely as it is presented to us by the Minister for Justice. We regard this Bill as a brutal, divisive, and ultimately counter-productive attack on the most basic rights of Irish citizens.;2625687

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;If the Government saw any way that the words 'as distinct from the health' could be omitted without giving rise to a real danger that this might eventually lead to abortion on demand, we would leave them out. It can be argued that a reference to 'life' on its own should be sufficient — on the basis that 'life' means 'life' and not 'health' and that the reference to 'life' in the existing Article 40. 3.3º has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case as not including health. However, the words 'as distinct from the health' formed part of the test enunciated by the Chief Justice in that case. If those words were to be omitted now from a constitutional provision which reproduces the essence of that test, significance might well be read into that omission. In a future 'hard' case health unrelated to a life-threatening condition might be found [1906] to be a ground for abortion, as happened in Britain in the Bourne case with the results we are all familiar with. Health unrelated to a threat to life has never been a ground for medical intervention where it is foreseen and therefore intended that the death of the unborn child would result. Unforeseen death of the foetus in the course of a medical intervention to protect the mother's life or her health, where all due care is taken to preserve the life of the foetus, is, of course, an entirely different matter and is not prohibited by law anyway. What the proposed Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution seeks to do is to maintain a just and proper balance between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the unborn child. A further criticism which has been made of the amendment is that it does not provide adequate protection for women in a situation where there would be a risk of the life of the mother being shortened rather than of her immediate death. In particular it has been suggested that the proposed amendment would not allow a woman to have her pregnancy terminated if she suffered from a medical condition — for example, a severe heart condition — which did not pose an immediate threat to her life but which would result in her early death if her pregnancy continued to full term. It has been suggested that the use of the word 'necessary' implies that there must be an immediate risk to the mother's life. It is clear that this does not follow. In the X case the Supreme Court held that termination of pregnancy is permissible where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother which can only be avoided by termination. The formulation 'which can only be avoided' seems to be at least as stringent as 'necessary'. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court also found that the risk to the mother's life need not be immediate. In fact it expressly rejected a submission that termination would be permissible only if it were established that an inevitable or immediate risk to the life of the mother existed. The proposed amendment does not disturb or change that finding in any [1907] way and does not require an immediate risk to life. Immediate necessity for termination of a pregnancy and immediate risk to the mother's life are, I suggest, two different things. The words 'necessary to save the life' mean that a pregnancy could be terminated if the doctors were able to form the view that, even after childbirth and recovery of the mother from it, other treatment for whatever she was suffering from would be ineffective to save her life. On the substantive issue one of the key questions which the Government had to address was whether the implications of the Supreme Court decision in the X case should be dealt with by way of legislation or an amendment to the Constitution. I know that some Members of the House are of the view that to proceed by way of legislation, rather than an amendment to the Constitution, would be better. However, any legislation which would be introduced without an amendment of the Constitution would have to accept in full the findings of the Supreme Court in the X case, including the finding that a risk of suicide would be a ground for abortion. Suicide as a ground could not be removed by legislation alone. Also, without an amendment the possibility could not be excluded that at some future date the grounds for abortion could be widened. I appreciate that concerns have been expressed that to deal with this matter by way of an amendment to the Constitution carries with it the danger of an emotive and divisive public debate. The fact that a particular issue gives rise to strongly held and often opposing views can hardly be accepted as a reason for not allowing the people to have a final say on that issue. There is a substantial body of opinion among the general public that the position now obtaining under Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution, in so far as a risk of self-destruction can serve as a ground for termination, is at variance with what many people thought it would be when that provision was adopted by referendum in 1983. The Government consider that it is only right that the people should be given a say as to [1908] whether they want that position modified now. Should it transpire that the people decide not to adopt the Twelfth Amendment, the Government have decided to introduce legislation instead to regulate the position obtaining as a result of the X decision. My colleague, the Minister for Health, will be dealing with this aspect in the course of his contribution to this debate. The extraordinary suggestion has been made in some quarters that, by indicating at this stage their intentions about legislation in the event of the proposed amendment not being adopted, the Government are in some sense issuing a threat to people who may not be satisfied with the proposed amendment from a pro-life perspective to, as it were, 'vote for it or else.' This suggestion is, of course, nonsense. The plain fact of the matter is that if the position obtaining after the X case is not addressed by way of an amendment to the Constitution, it can only be dealt with by legislation. The Government are proposing an amendment of the Constitution and, after full and careful consideration of what is involved and of all the implications, are proposing the form of amendment which they are satisfied meets the needs to safeguard the lives of pregnant women while at the same time giving the maximum possible protection to the right to life of the unborn child consistent with that. If that amendment is defeated, which incidentally I do not believe will happen, it is the Government's firm and considered view that the only practicable alternative is to legislate on the basis of the X case. That is simply a fact. It is not meant to be a threat to anybody or to put pressure on them to vote in a particular way in the referendum. The reality of the situation is that, if the Government are not prepared to indicate at this stage what form our legislative proposals would take in the event that the constitutional amendment did not pass, we would be open to legitimate criticism. I fail to see how anybody can seriously suggest that we are to be faulted for ensuring that the people will be fully informed about the [1909] whole picture when they vote in the referenda on 3 December. The question has also been raised whether legislation should be introduced which would supplement the amendment, if passed. It seems to me that the test proposed in the amendment is a straightforward one based on whether or not termination of pregnancy is necessary to save the life of the mother and should not give rise to difficulty in practice. The Government are not at this stage persuaded of the need for such supplementary legislation. We will, of course, listen carefully to any views expressed on this matter during the course of the debate. Deputies will be aware that Protocol No. 17 to the Maastricht Treaty saves the application in Ireland of Article 40. 3.3º from the effect of EC law which, under the Constitution, takes precedence over any other conflicting provisions of the Constitution. The Protocol was designed to ensure that abortion would not become legalised in the State by virtue of EC law. The Protocol relates to Article 40. 3.3º as it stood on 7 February 1992 when the Treaty was signed. On the face of things Article 40. 3.3º as interpreted by the Supreme Court should retain the protection of the Protocol when the Treaty comes into effect and this would mean that abortion could not in any event be legalised beyond the extent permitted by the Supreme Court. The Solemn Declaration on the Protocol to the Treaty, adopted by the member states on 1 May 1992, provides that in the event of a constitutional amendment of Article 40. 3.3º the Contracting Parties to the Treaty will, following the entry into force of the Treaty, be favourably disposed to amending the Protocol so as to extend its application to any such constitutional amendment. If the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution is passed the question of invoking the procedure set out in the Solemn Declaration with a view to securing an amendment of the Protocol will be taken up. To sum up, the Government have taken a balanced and considered approach to the very difficult problems [1910] associated with the substantive issue. We recognise the genuineness and the depth of people's feelings and concerns about this whole subject—whether from a pro-life, pro-choice or other point of view. Our objective is to do what is right in the public interest. We have been motivated by deep concern for the right to life of the unborn. We are also fully committed to the protection of the right to life of the unborn. We are not prepared to take any chances where the life of the mother is at stake and we want to ensure the maximum possible protection of the right to life of the unborn consistent with that. I turn now to the Thirteenth Amendment Bill regarding travel. The background to the proposal in this Bill must be seen in the context not only of the Supreme Court's decision in the X case but also in the context of EC law. In that case, three of the Supreme Court judges decided that the constitutional right to life of the unborn took precedence over the constitutional right to travel of the mother so that an injunction can be granted by virtue of Article 40. 3.3º against women going abroad for an unlawful abortion (i. e. one in which there is not a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, as enunciated by the Supreme Court). With regard to the EC aspects, the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty provides that nothing in the Treaty or in the European Community Treaties shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. Assuming that the Maastricht Treaty comes into force, the Protocol will then form part of the European Community Treaties and it will be for the European Court of Justice to decide what the Protocol means. The Irish Courts will be bound by that court's interpretation of the Protocol. The main purpose of the Protocol was to ensure that abortion would not become legalised in the State by virtue of EC law —freedom of travel to other EC states for an abortion was not envisaged as being affected. However, the argument has been made that the Maastricht Protocol, if passed, would copperfasten the effect of the Supreme Court judgment in [1911] relation to travel and would nullify rights of free movement conferred by the EC and Maastricht Treaties. Whether this is correct depends, of course, on the proper interpretation of the phrase in the Protocol 'the application in Ireland of Article 40. 3.3º '. It can be contended that the issue of an injunction in Ireland against a woman within the jurisdiction to protect an unborn life within the jurisdiction is an application in Ireland of Article 40. 3.3. On the other hand it can also be argued that the phrase must be intended to refer to effects in Ireland only and cannot restrict movement or actions outside Ireland. That has been the contention of the EC Council's Legal Service. Freedom of movement of persons is one of the freedoms guaranteed by the EC Treaties. It is part of the Community's legal order that people are free to move to any place in the Community, either to work or to establish themselves, or to provide or receive services. This freedom, as is clear in particular from provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, is a fundamental principle of the Community and will be of growing value in the years to come. Because of the fundamental importance of freedom of movement in the EC, it is likely that if in future the European Court had to deal with the issue, it would decide that the Protocol did not envisage Article 40. 3.3º having extra-territorial effect and that injunctions against leaving the country for another EC member state could not be issued consistently with EC law. However, to avoid any uncertainty about the matter, the Solemn Declaration on which the Government got agreement among EC partners affirms in effect that the Protocol as it stands protects the right to travel between EC states and under generally recognised rules of interpretation of international treaties—I am referring in particular to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties—the Declaration would have to be taken into account in interpreting the Protocol. The Government's proposed constitutional [1912] amendment on travel is designed in any event to put exercise of the right to travel beyond doubt and to make it clear that it cannot be restricted by reason of Article 40. 3.3º. This is in line with the commitment in the statements of 9 June 1992 of party leaders, which I have already mentioned. It will also ensure freedom to travel to all States, not just to other member states of the EC. It is fair to say that there is wide support for the Government's proposal on this matter. I come now to the third Bill, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill on freedom to provide and receive information. This issue did not, as I have said earlier, come before the Supreme Court in the X case. However, the Supreme Court decided in cases in 1988 (the Well Woman Centre case) and 1989 (the Grogan case) that the dissemination of information on abortion is unlawful having regard to Article 40. 3.3º. Following the X case that prohibition extends only to information on abortion not covered by the decision (i. e. abortions in cases where there is not a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother). In the Well Woman Centre case, which is at present before the European Court of Human Rights on allegations of breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights, the State has conceded that point. The information issue was raised before the EC Court of Justice in the Grogan case. The effect of the decision of the Court of Justice is that, while lawful abortion in a state constitutes a service within the meaning of the EC Treaty, it is not contrary to Community law for a member state in which abortion is forbidden to prohibit the distribution of information about abortion services available in another member state where there is no economic link between the provider of the abortion service and the distributor of the information (in the particular case the distributor was a students' association). The court did not specifically decide, but could be taken as implying, that if there was such a link the distribution of the information would be [1913] permissible under Community law. That aspect, including the conditions which might be placed on the provision of information, has not come before the court in any case. Recently, on 7 August 1992, the High Court granted a permanent injunction in the Grogan case restraining the students from distributing information on abortion clinics abroad. The judge in the case identified a profound distinction between the distribution of the documentation and information in which the students were engaged—distribution to the community at large and university students in particular—and communication of such information to a clearly defined and extremely restricted type of person indentified by the Supreme Court in the X case. As in the case of travel, the question of the freedom to give and obtain, in the State, information about abortion facilities in another EC state has been raised in the context of the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty. The argument has been made that the Protocol would nullify rights to information conferred by EC law. The Solemn Declaration on which the Government got agreement among EC Partners deals with the matter. It affirms that the Protocol protects freedom to obtain or make available in Ireland information relating to services lawfully available in member states. The Declaration also provides that the information may be subject to Irish legislation that is in conformity with Community law. As I have already said, under generally recognised rules of interpretation of international treaties, the Declaration would have to be taken into account in interpreting the Protocol. On the basis of what we know from the Grogan case, as dealt with by the Court of Justice, there is no absolute right to information under EC law — the right indeed may be subject to appropriate conditions laid down in national laws. The fact is that member states have a reasonable margin of discretion to decide what should or should not be permissible in their national laws on abortion information and some EC states have controls [1914] on public advertising of abortion services. As I have mentioned, the question of the right to information is before the European Court on Human Rights at present in a case involving the Well Woman Centre. The court is due to issue its decision on 29 October but there are no grounds for believing that that will interfere in any way with the amendment on information. The proposed amendment would enshrine in the Constitution the right to receive and impart information subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law. This, again, is in line with the commitments given in the party leaders' statement. The amendment would not permit directive counselling but would permit non-directive counselling. Directive counselling, as I understand it, is systematic guidence and advice and involves abortion referral. Non-directive counselling, on the other hand, consists of the provision of information and does not involve abortion referral. Non-directive counselling would clearly be covered by the right to obtain or make available information which is provided for in the amendment. In conjunction with publication of the Constitutional Amendment Bill on information the Government have agreed the publication of the Minister for Health's proposals for legislative controls on the supply of information. Those proposals can only be published in draft form at this stage because they are dependent on the amendment of the Constitution being carried in the referendum that is proposed. The Government's view is that the House and the people should be aware of what the Government's approach would be on supply of information. My colleague the Minister for Health will be speaking further on this matter in the course of the debate. I want to refer to one final point. The decision of the Government has been to put the issues to the people as separate amendments in separate referenda on the same day rather than in one amendment which would deal with the issues together. It is the view of the Government [1915] that the advantage of separate referenda is a greater degree of choice in that the people will be enabled to exercise their choice separately in respect of each issue. Voters will be able to vote for or against each issue and each amendment will be decided in its own right and on its own merit. There appears to have been a general welcome for that approach among the public and I am sure that Deputies will agree that it is the most democratic way of dealing with these important issues. I commend the Bills to the House.;2625690
714;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;It is not acceptable to us, and it never will be, that our Constitution should set out to treat half of our citizens differently, just because those citizens happen to be women. From the day it was founded eighty years ago, the Labour Party has stood for life. We have stood for the right to life, to shelter, to health and to welfare — and we have stood for them as fundamental rights. Whether they were written into the Irish Constitution or not, it has been a fundamental tenet of my party that every Irish citizen has an equal right to all of these things. And we have campaigned for them abroad, just as we have at home. Our record, and our consistency, in all of these issues cannot be challenged by anyone. We have stood for the principle of a republic throughout all those years too. A republic for us involves a society built on tolerance, on freedom of expression and freedom to follow different beliefs. This Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, as it is drafted, is a brutal assault on the republic. None of that makes us particularly special, or marks us out as different. Most Irish people believe in the rights I have mentioned. Most Irish people believe in republican principles — real republican principles, [1938] not the perversions of republicanism practised by terrorists. Most Irish political parties, too, support republican principles. Indeed, one party leader in this House once made a famous declaration of his determination to stand by the republic. We will all watch with interest to see whether or not he stands by, or stands idly by instead, when this attack on republican principles is voted upon this week. This Bill is being foisted on the people of Ireland by a Government that either has not thought it out, or is unable to understand, or is unwilling to admit, what the Bill actually means. I have to say at this stage that it is typical of what we have come to expect from the present Taoiseach, who appears to believe in the idea that Government can operate with its eyes tightly shut, stumbling from crisis to crisis, without ever any clear philosophy or considered policy. It seems clear from all of the Taoiseach's utterances on this subject that he regards this issue as nothing more than a political sore tooth, and the quicker it is dealt with the better. It does not matter if the management of the problem actually makes it worse in the long-term — sure that will be someone else's problem. The problem created by this Bill will be much more than a problem for politicians. It will be a problem for the rights of women. That is a fact that appears to have been completely ignored and passed over by the Taoiseach. This is a Bill which will incorporate into our Constitution, alone among the written Constitutions of the western world, the principle of legal abortion, but it is so badly drafted that in practice, the wording of the Bill will potentially put many more women at risk than are at risk at the present moment. The most criticised aspect of the drafting of this Bill has been the use of the distinction between the life and the health of the mother. Ministers have responded to all the criticisms of the drafting by saying 'that is not our distinction, they are the words of the Chief Justice in the X case'. That is one of the many myths that the Government are trying to [1939] perpetrate about this issue, and it is as well that it be disposed of at the outset. The Chief Justice in the X case was dealing with a very particular set of circumstances, involving as we know the sort of tragedy that can devastate any Irish family, no matter how close or loving. He was in essence adjudicating between two 'tests' that had been put forward in the particular circumstances of that case. The first test, advocated by counsel on behalf of the family, was (and I quote from 'The Attorney General v. X and Others'): ...If it was established as a matter of probability that the continuation of the life of the unborn child constituted a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother then the conflict thus arising should be resolved by preferring the life of the mother. The Attorney General, on the other hand, argued in that case that the 'true test' should be: ...If it was established in any case that the continuation of the life of the unborn constituted a risk of immediate or inevitable death to the mother the termination of the pregnancy would be justified and lawful. It could hardly be clearer, in my view, that the Chief Justice in adjudicating between those two tests was deciding between the issue of 'real and substantial risk' on the one hand, and 'immediate or inevitable death' on the other. The Supreme Court was not asked in the particular case to adjudicate between health and life. If they had been, the arguments would have been entirely different. The conclusions might more readily support the position the Government have arrived at, or they might not. We are not in a position to know. What we do know is that it is absurd and irresponsible to use the remarks of the Chief Justice, taken completely out of their context, as justification for these dangerous words. That is not the only irresponsibility of which the Government stand accused. [1940] In a statement I issued last weekend, I pointed out that Ireland has many pressing and grave economic and social problems. They all demand the attention of policy makers and people alike. It is completely wrong that they should be allowed to be pushed to one side of the political agenda in order to facilitiate this debate, which will increasingly divide homes and communities over the weeks and months ahead. And for what? To insert into our Constitution a form of words which is gratuitously offensive to every woman in Ireland, and to every man who believes in equal citizenship. Throughout the debate, the only thing we can be certain of is that we will be bombarded from all sides by people who are absolutely certain of the correctness of their position. One of the most dispiriting aspects of all of these issues is the capacity for participants to adopt absolute and fundamental positions about issues where absolutism is simply impossible. We will be lectured by doctors who assure us that doctors know best, though we are unlikely to hear from women who have suffered because of mistakes made by the medical profession. We will be lectured by male lawyers and professors of law who will also know best — even though they could have no appreciation of the hurt their views can inflict. We will be lectured by politicians who will argue they and they alone have the interests of the nation at heart, as if the nation consisted of only those who agree with them. Throughout all of these lectures, the people most affected by them are the people least likely to be consulted. They will, in general, be women and girls, many of them in distress or pain, many of them suffering from physical or mental conditions of which we are being asked to take no account. On polling day, many will cast their votes more in hope that this is the end of the matter rather than in any genuine expectation that they have solved a spiritual, emotional, and physical crisis. If this Government were serious about addressing that emotional and physical [1941] crisis, they would think again. But they are not serious. This Government are not only willing to play politics with the lives, health, feelings, emotions and beliefs of Irish women — they seem determined to do so. And they are determined to do so in a particularly callous, brutal and unfeeling way. I have not seen in any of the interviews with Ministers that have been broadcast or recorded over the past couple of weeks so much as a shred of sympathy for the agonising dilemma in which so many women find themselves. Let me make it perfectly clear where I stand. I do not want an abortion regime in Ireland. I do not intend to campaign for the introduction of such a regime. But it is unacceptable to me, and I suspect to the great majority of people in this country, that no matter what distress or danger a pregnancy causes, no matter what caused that pregnancy in the first place, no matter what the outcome of that pregnancy is going to be, that we should by our laws and Constitution expect every woman in every circumstance to carry that pregnancy to full term. Let us make no mistake about it. That is what this amendment, and the accompanying refusal of the Government to legislate unless the amendment is defeated, really means. We are going to put into our constitution, if this Government have their way, a provision that will require doctors, and nobody else, to determine what might be a constitutional abortion and what might not. That is more than an absurdity. It is an obscenity. For the remainder of this speech, I intend to put on the record of the Dáil the detailed views of the Labour Party in relation to the three amendments proposed by the Government. The Government's proposed amendment in relation to travel in the Thirteenth Amendment Bill is a new subsection (presumably 40. 3.3ºi) to read as follows: Subsection 3º of this Section shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and another state. [1942] The wording proposed by the Government presumes that there is a right of travel but is this correct? Such a general right is not referred to in the Constitution anywhere. We will be putting an amendment on Committee Stage of this Bill to insert a positive right to travel in Article 40. 3.2º The amendment must also protect the right to receive a service lawfully available elsewhere, as well as simply the right to travel, and we will be putting down amendments to that effect also. The courts have held that the unborn is implicitly protected by other provisions of the Constitution, apart from Article 40. 3.3º. I refer to statements in McGee v. Attorney General and Norris v. Ireland). So these other provisions could be relied on in a travel injunction case, since the amendment relates only to limiting the scope of Article 40. 3.3º. The wording proposed by the Government in the Fourteenth Amendment Bill is: Subsection 3º of this section shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state. Again, this wording is negative rather than affirmative. It does not create a right to give and receive information. Neither does it prohibit the Oireachtas from banning information. It is unreasonable to expect people to vote on this without an idea of the conditions to be laid down by law. In addition, it is essential to protect the right to counselling and to assistance as well, and we will be putting down amendments to try to achieve that. It is perhaps another indication of the haste with which this legislation has been brought before the House that we were informed this afternoon by the Minister for Justice that his colleague at some time during this debate will give some draft ideas on the legislation that will be introduced. That is not good enough. This issue is far too serious and urgent for the House to wait upon draft legislation to be put before us by the Minister for [1943] Health. If the Government had been organised in what they were doing, that legislation, even in draft form, would have been before the House prior to the commencement of this debate. The words 'another state' in that Bill should be 'another jurisdiction' since, for example, abortion is generally unlawful in parts of the state of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) but is generally lawful in the jurisdiction of England and Wales. Even a cursory examination of these two Bills, which we support in principle, reveal bad and sloppy draftsmanship which must, in our view, be corrected on Committee Stage if the amendments contained in them are to serve the long-term purpose for which they are intended. But the mistakes in these Bills pale into insignificance baside the truly draconian meanings and interpretations which potentially can arise from the Twelfth Amendment Bill, the substantive issue, with which I now propose to deal. As I have already said, the proposed changes to Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution represent an intensely sensitive issue, which involves the lives, health, feelings, emotions, and beliefs of every Irish woman and girl. These changes must be examined carefully in that light. So far, the confusion spread by the Government's different interpretations of what the proposed text means has only served to illustrate now little consideration has been given by Ministers to so sensitive an issue. It was absolutely appalling to witness the different interpretations given in the hours immediately after the wording was presented. It showed yet again the lack of discussion and proper preparation by the Government before publishing the wording. It is worth making the point at this stage, in case there is any misunderstanding about it, that this Bill was not required by the joint declaration signed by the four party leaders prior to the Maastricht referendum. It was the Labour Party which drafted the relevant passages of that declaration dealing with [1944] these issues. We were careful to make a clear distinction at the time between, on the one hand, the agreed determination of the four party leaders to copperfasten rights of travel and information, and on the other, the right of the Government to bring forward proposals for legislative and/or constitutional change when the Cabinet sub-committee had finished its work. All the evidence suggests that the Cabinet sub-committee did no serious work whatever on this issue. It seems instead to have functioned as nothing more than a vehicle for the rivalry between the two political parties in Government, with the smaller party allowing themselves to be rail-roaded into decisions they clearly did not support. Indeed, according to my information, at least one of the members of the sub-committee, the night before the Government meeting which finally decided the issue, was discussing a quite different form of words with a delegation he met. If that is an indicator of how little concern was being shown by the sub-committee to getting it right, it is no surprise that the Government have ended up in the present mess. This confusion also serves to make the point that it is almost impossible to legislate for a complex set of circumstances by seeking to insert one sentence into the Constitution. The ultimate outcome of the so-called 'Pro-life Amendment' foisted upon us in 1983 is further proof, if proof is needed. As a result of all this cheap internal politics, the Government are proposing to add words to the existing provision of the Constitution, so that, in toto, Article 40. 3.3º would read as follows: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where [1945] there is an illness or disorder of the mother which gives rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction. According to statements made by the Government this wording accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in the X case, in respect of everything except the threat of suicide. Of course this is a distortion of what happened in the Supreme Court. The net, basic, effect of the Supreme Court decision in the X case was that an abortion is permissible in this jurisdiction in certain circumstances defined by the court. The bottom line effect of the amendment, whatever Government Ministers may argue is this: if this amendment is accepted, the Constitution will provide for the carrying out of legal abortions in certain circumstances. The principle of legal abortion is, therefore, being proposed for insertion into our Constitution. However, the situation is not nearly as simple as appears from this description of the effect in principle. The circumstances in which abortions may be carried out are far from clear — and it is entirely possible that the amendment, as it is drafted, may in fact render illegal certain operations which may be lawful now. Almost every single word in the Government's proposed amendment is loaded with potential meaning. No one can predict at this stage whether or not this issue will become the subject of litigation in the future, or what the result of litigation will be. What is clear is that statements of 'Government intent' are a meaningless basis for predicting the outcome of any future test by the Supreme Court. The words will be judged on what they mean, and not on what the present Government would like them to mean. The principal dangers in the form of words proposed by the Government lie in the following words: 'necessary', 'save', 'as distinct from the health', 'disorder', 'not being at risk of self-destruction'. The potential meaning and consequence of each of these words, both [1946] individually and taken all together, could place many women at risk. The word 'necessary' in this context implies restrictiveness. The essential meaning of the word is to imply that terminations would only take place where they are absolutely unavoidable. While many would agree with this in principle, in practice it could lead to situations where necessary terminations are delayed until a medical emergency has occurred. This is compounded by the use of the term 'save the life'. It is easier to understand the potential meaning of this term if it is contrasted with an alternative — for example, 'protect the life'. One protects someone's life from the probability of a medical emergency happening in the future. One saves someone's life from the consequences of that emergency. For instance: a woman with cardiac disease becomes pregnant. Her doctor is satisfied that at some stage during the stress of a pregnancy, her life may be at serious risk from a heart attack. In a regime devoted to protecting her life, immediate or early termination of the pregnancy would be an option. In a regime aimed at saving her life, termination could also be an option — but perhaps not until the heart attack was imminent or had already happened. The phrase 'As distinct from the health', has attracted so much comment and apart altogether from the innate offensiveness of this term, which implies that the health of women is not an area of concern, and is redolent of a controversy in this State forty five years ago, the use of this term is very dangerous for women. To take a similar example, this time involving a woman suffering from high blood pressure, if it was the medical opinion in her case that she was unlikely to die as a result of a pregnancy, but was at serious risk of a debilitating stroke, it might not be possible to recommend a termination — since it would be her health, and not her life, in the literal sense, that would be at risk. One could go further. The use of the term 'as distinct from the health' could [1947] also rule out operations that would be perfectly legal now, if they were necessary to save the health, as distinct from the life, of a woman. In other words, in any situation where it is 'merely' the health of the woman that is at risk, both 'direct' and 'indirect' abortion could be illegal. To take an example. Suppose a newly pregnant woman is involved in a serious car accident, which involves extensive damage to her spine and lower back, internal bleeding, and so on. While her condition can be stabilised and maintained, extensive and immediate surgery is necessary to ensure that she will walk again. There may be the risk that the foetus in her womb will be inadvertently killed or damaged in the course of the surgery. This would be what the 'pro-life' movement call an indirect abortion. It is only necessary to save the health, that is, the ability to walk, of the mother. It is entirely doubtful that it could be regarded as legal under the proposals put by the Government before this House. Taken together, these phrases 'necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother' also mean that there will be a number of grey areas, where it is impossible to be certain that mothers at risk to their health will be fully protected. For example, if chemotherapy is withheld from a pregnant woman in the early stages of cancer, that will not, in the immediate sense, literally threaten her life, but it will aid the progression of the disease, and will almost certainly shorten her life. Since the proposal is to allow women's lives to be 'saved' rather than protected or prolonged, it is entirely arguable that this provision will rule out terminations in 'life-shortening' situations, and allow them only in immediate 'life-threatening' situations. The use of the word 'disorder' is referred to in the explanatory document circulated by the Government as being necessary to include ectopic pregnancies. It appears that the Government intention is to rule out all forms of psychological and psychiatric disorders. In reality, [1948] some such disorders do have 'life-threatening' and/or 'life-shortening' physical manifestations — anorexia nervosa, for instance, can be a very dangerous physical condition, even though its origin is psychological. Acute or chronic depression can also have dangerous physical consequences for its victims. Finally, the Government have ruled out the possibility of a termination based on the 'risk of self-destruction'. This appears to be a blanket ban — no matter how imminent or certain the risk is. It denies a termination to the woman or girl who threatens suicide, but it also denies it to the girl who is in a suicidally depressed state and has already slashed her wrists twice. This ignores the fact that any decision-making process involving the provision of terminations on the grounds of threatened suicide would involve psychiatrists, psychologists, and possibly social workers, and would have to take account of a wide range of factors. In this connection, I have to say that I regard it as both wrong and unacceptable that the profession of psychiatry appears to be treated in this debate as if the opinions of that profession were in some way less valid than those of physicians or obstetricians. There has been a great deal of sneering at the notion of a woman or a girl being a genuine or potential suicide risk, as if it were some kind of excuse. There has been too much rumour-mongering, and too much innuendo, about the circumstances behind the X case, as if we should not be expected to accept the facts already accepted by a judge of the High Court and the entire Supreme Court. Only last night, on the 'Questions and Answers' programme on RTE, an eminent doctor needlessly and mindlessly repeated the myth that these circumstances were 'manufactured'. The truth is that there is a substantial body of literature in this whole area. That literature shows quite clearly that suicide is an occasional outcome of refused abortion. The literature also shows that suicide among pregnant women and girls has [1949] fallen in those jurisdictions which permit abortion on psychiatric grounds. A great deal of the literature is of course subjective, but it is also instructive, and perhaps, it is especially relevant to us. One eminent study, for example, concluded that 'the awareness of deviance from the norms of the social group may make a suicide attempt or threat more likely'. To put it another way, if a girl is young, or single, or the victim of a sexual assault or incest, and becomes pregnant, she is going to be far more vulnerable to psychological or psychiatric damage. That damage can be compounded far more by her religious or cultural beliefs, or the beliefs of those whose support and approval she needs, than it would be by, for example, her financial circumstances. A girl in this situation, even if she is surrounded by love and affection, can find herself totally alone. Even though the circumstances of her pregnancy might involve no willing participation on her part, she can come to believe that she has betrayed not only her loved ones, but all the values they have tried to instil. It is when that girl is entirely alone, isolated from support and marginalised from those she cares about, that she is most at risk. Are we seriously going to say that she does not matter? If we make our law as inflexible as we are proposing, that is precisely what we are doing. I have a daughter, and there is no law in the land that would prevent me from reaching out to my daughter, or I hope to any child in trouble, to help in any way I could to put that trouble right. I am not unique — far from it. Many Members have children, and all of us represent children as much as we represent their parents. All of us believe, and want to believe, that if any of our own children need us, we will be there for them. What that means is that we must recognise, no matter how painful it might be, that there are times when the only way we can relieve pain and suffering, and remove risk to children, is to rely on the advice of psychiatrists and other professions [1950] who can see too clearly the danger they are in. Under the Government's Bill, terminations of pregnancy will never be allowed in the case of victims of rape or incest — unless of course those victims are also suffering from some highly dangerous physical illness, which threatens to kill them in the short-term. The reality — and it is a reality that we must face as parents as well as legislators — is that there are some circumstances where rape and incest can result in life-threatening psychiatric conditions. It may be unpalatable, but unless we want to place young girls, already victims of monstrous injustice, at further risk, we will delete this provision. The Government are proposing that no legislation will accompany this constitutional change, even though we now know that all the legal advice available to the Government is to the effect that legislation is also necessary. A failure to legislate would place doctors in the position of being the sole arbiters of what was or was not a constitutional protection. They would have no immunity or idemnity in making these decisions. They would have no guarantee that they would not be prosecuted for procuring an unlawful miscarriage if anyone disagreed with their decisions. They would have no guarantee that they would not be sued if they refused to arrange a termination and the result was the death of a mother. This is an impossible situation. In addition, legislation is also necessary to set out the services to which women would be entitled if the amendment were carried. In short, passage of this amendment cannot absolve the Government from the responsibility to legislate, so clearly spelled out in Mr. Justice McCarthy's judgement in the X case. We should remind ourselves of what he said: In the context of the eight years that have passed since the Amendment was adopted... the failure by the legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate it is inexcusable. What are pregnant [1951] women to do? What are the parents of a pregnant girl under age to do? What are the medical profession to do? They have no guidelines save what may be gleaned from the judgments in this case. In future, they will have even fewer guidelines, if these dangerous words are inserted into the Constitution. Mr. Justice McCarthy also went on to say in his judgment that: Legislation may be both negative and positive: negative, in prohibiting aboslutely or at a given time, or without meeting stringent tests positive by requiring positive action. The State may fulfil its role by providing necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort, to plan for the pregnant woman, the pregnant girl or her family. Are we to prove yet again, by passing this Bill, that this House is very good at prohibiting, and hopeless at providing? Are we to prove yet again the this House is prepared to ignore its responsibility to encourage, to comfort, and to plan, in favour of taking the easy way out? The drafting of the provisions in relation to travel and information is inadequate, and does not cover the 'copper-fastening' promised by the four Party Leaders in their joint declaration. In regard to the substantive issue, the words proposed by the Government have a number of consequences that are not envisaged within their declared intentions. While the words do enshrine the principle of legal abortion in the Constitution, one of the practical results could be to rule out operations that are legal at present. In summary, the Government's proposals on the substantive issue could prohibit termination of 'life-shortening' pregnancies 'health-threatening' pregnancies and pregnancies which are likely, or certain, to cause the mother to commit suicide. No account is taken in the words to the right of women to have their health and [1952] welfare fully protected the words make those rights secondary to the rights of the foetus. The complexity of the issue, the failure of the constitutional amendment to address those complexities, and the difficulty of drafting a constitutional amendment that would address them adequately, make it infinitely preferable that this whole issue be addressed through legislation. Indeed, it is almost certain that there is no form of words that will not lead to further confusion and litigation in the future. Our Constitution is based on the underlying principles of prudence, justice and charity. It was prudence, justice and charity that informed the Supreme Court judgement in the X case. In prudence, justice and charity, I say that it is impossible to recommend support for this dangerous, divisive and potentially cruel amendment. I hope that, in the course of this debate, over whatever number of days and nights it takes place, the Government will change their mind, that they will see the error of their ways and realise that the Fianna Fáil Party do not alone contain all the wisdom in relation to this issue.

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;It is only right at the start of this debate we recall the circumstances which have given rise to the constitutional referenda proposals now before the House. At the very end of January 1992 a report was made to the Garda that a 14 year old girl had been the victim of sexual abuse and statutory rape and was pregnant. The girl's parents reached the conclusion that the pregnancy resulting from rape should be terminated. On 27 January 1992 she told her parents and she and her parents learnt from the local doctor that she was pregnant. It was accepted by the court that this tragic young girl, referred to as X, had confided in her mother that when she learnt she was pregnant she had wanted to kill herself by throwing herself downstairs. On 31 January 1992 she again said much the same to a member of the Garda Síochána. During the return journey from England she told her mother that she had wanted to throw herself under a train [1916] when she was in London and that she would be rather dead than the way she was. In the presence of another member of the Garda, when her father commented that the situation was worse than a death in the family she stated, 'Not if it was me'. Following her return from England she was taken by her parents to an experienced clinical psychologist. He found that she was emotionally withdrawn, in a state of shock and had lost touch with her feelings. He took that as indicating that she was coping with the appalling crisis she faced by denial of her emotions. He stated that she did not seem depressed but that she coldly expressed a desire to end matters by taking her own life. The psychologist was of the opinion that she was capable of committing suicide, not just because of depression but because she could calculatingly reach the conclusion that death was the best solution. It is regrettable that the Minister did not refer in detail to the facts of this case in his speech. In the High Court Judge Costello accepted that there was a risk that this tragic young teenager might take her own life. He held, however, that it was much less and in a different order of magnitude than the certainty that the life of the unborn would be terminated if the injunction were not granted. The outcome of the case give rise to substantial public controversy. A Supreme Court appeal was brought and was successful. In dealing with the circumstances in which a pregnancy can be terminated by way of abortion, a majority of the Supreme Court concluded that a pregnancy may be terminated if it was established as a matter of probability that its continuance involved a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. The court concluded that there was no doubt that such a risk existed from the uncontested evidence heard by the trial judge in the High Court. The court did not differentiate between a physical condition which poses such risk and a mental condition. The Chief Justice stated: In my view it is common sense that [1917] a threat to self-destruction such as is outlined in the evidence in his case, which the psychologist clearly believes to be a very real threat, cannot be monitored in that sense and that it is almost impossible to prevent self-destruction in a young girl in the situation in which this defendant is, if she were to decide to carry out her threat of suicide. Mr. Justice Egan stated: The risk must be to her life but it is irrelevant, in my view, that it should be a risk of self-destruction rather than a risk to life for any other reason. Mr. Justice O'Flaherty agreed with this conclusion, as did the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy. The latter stated: I am wholly satisfied that a real and substantial risk that the girl might take her own life was established it follows that she should not be prevented from having a medical termination of pregnancy. The only judge who dissented from this conclusion was Mr. Justice Hederman. This decision of the Supreme Court resolved a controversy that had raged on and off within the State since 1982 as to the exact meaning of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, Article 40. 3.3º. It confirmed that this Article, rather than totally prohibiting abortion, as its original proponents contended, contemplated abortion lawfully taking place within this State. The result of the X case was not merely to allow this young girl to again travel to England to have her pregnancy terminated but also to entitle her to have an abortion in this State if she sought one in the tragic circumstances in which she found herself. While it was not necessary for the court to decide the issue of the girl's right to travel, having regard to her entitlement to terminate her pregnancy within the State, the judges of the court nevertheless addressed that issue due to its essential public importance. By a majority they concluded that a woman's right to travel outside the State could be [1918] impeded by way of court injunctions in circumstances where she intended to have a pregnancy terminated and where there was no real and substantial risk to her life. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to state that the result of the Supreme Court case with regard to the circumstances of this tragic 14 year old girl and her family was greeted with a universal sigh of national relief. It was, I believe, a general view that a pregnant young teenager who is the victim of rape and her family should not be put through such a legal trauma. There was a belief that the young girl and her family should have been left to make decisions that they believed right in the interests of the girl's welfare and that the State should not have interfered. For many of those — and I include myself in this — who opposed the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution in the referendum campaign in 1983 the case in a very stark way highlighted the possible different interpretations that could be put on the words contained in it and the manner in which its constitutional provision could impact on the lives of ordinary people trapped in personal tragedy. It was always my view that this provision was a constitutional time bomb waiting to go off. What is surprising is that it took almost 10 years to explode. Before turning to the specific constitutional proposals before the House there are some general comments I want to make with regard to the difficult issues with which we are confronted. Neither the Fine Gael Party nor the overwhelming majority of people on this island want to see general abortion available in Ireland—what some people refer to as 'abortion on demand'. In saying that, I reiterate what was said in the House on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to both myself and many of my colleagues during the difficult and emotional debate that took place on the Eighth Amendment Bill in 1983. It was then and is again important that this be put on the record because in 1983 anyone either inside or outside the House who for good and considered reasons was opposed to the holding of that referendum and who disagreed [1919] with the wording which was eventually inserted in the Constitution found themselves labelled abortionist and anti-life. In 1983 for totally cynical political reasons the Fianna Fáil Party sought to so label and besmirch Members of this House and others for their own cynical electoral gain. From the speech given by the Minister for Justice today, it is apparent that Fianna Fáil intend to again travel along that road during the course of the coming weeks. There was a hope following the coming to office of the present Taoiseach that no similar games would be played by Fianna Fáil with such sensitive and difficult issues. There was a glimmer of hope that we were entering a new political era and that difficult social issues would be honestly and openly addressed. The Government's behaviour during the past two weeks, however, clearly illustrates that this is not so. If there is a single lesson that should have been learned by politicians inside this House and, indeed, by lobby groups outside it, it is that this whole area is far too complex to simply be dealt with by the insertion of an extra sentence or two into our Constitution.;2625695

720;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage.;20.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;To highlight this, it is worth briefly recalling the claims made by the proponents of the 1983 amendment, one of the most vociferous of which in this House was the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, together with other members of the current Government, including the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. Warnings then sounded as to the ambiguity contained in the wording of the Eighth Amendment and their diversity of possible interpretations were ignored. The fact that these warnings were sounded by the then Fine Gael Taoiseach, Dr. G. FitzGerald, the then Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan (Limerick East) and by many other [1920] members of the Fine Gael Party both in Government and on the backbenches simply resulted in allegations that such people were in some way soft on abortion. For the Fianna Fáil Deputies I have referred to and the lobby groups who operated outside this House, such as PLAC and SPUC, nothing was ambiguous. In 1983 everything was clear in absolutist terms. Specualtion that the wording might not say what its advocates propounded was labelled dishonest. Those who queried its wording and the dangers of its application were the objects of hate-mail. It is worth recalling what that advocates of the Eighth Amendment said they intended and contended with certainty would be achieved. First, and foremost, they claimed it would outlaw abortion in all circumstances. In this they were totally wrong and, now, of course, it is the Supreme Court and not themselves who are to blame. They stated it would not affect the right of pregnant women to travel abroad in this they were wrong also. They contended that such a constitutional provision would provide a sort of atmosphere that would result in a reduction in the numbers of Irish women going abroad to terminate pregnancies in this they were also wrong. In 1983, approximately 3,000 Irish women, according to official figures, had abortions in England in 1991 over 4,000 Irish women had abortions in England. The primary result of the 1983 amendment was to ensure that more people in Ireland were informed about the availability of abortion outside Ireland than would previously have considered abortion as an option. It also has now provided for an implicit constitutional right to abortion, which right is now to be made explicit, in the terms of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Assertions made by Members of this House in 1983 who are now in Government with regard to the effect of the 1983 amendment are of relevance in the context of the debate we are to have in particular on the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. They are relevant [1921] because we have seen in recent days that the proponents of the wording contained in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill are unwilling to listen to those who are expressing concern as to its contents and worries about its impact. At the weekend, the Minister for Justice, was praised for his outstanding rhetoric at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting on Wednesday last which reportedly satisfied his political colleagues that the course the Government are charting is correct and that the constitutional amendments proposed by them are both legally and politically sound. I have, in recent weeks, had an eerie feeling that Members of this House and many of the lobby groups outside this House, are locked in a 1983 time warp. The reports I have heard of the Fianna Fáil meeting of Wednesday last have confirmed to me that we are truly back to the future. From the Minister's speech this evening it is clear that the Fianna Fáil party, at least, have learned no lessons. I would caution those members of Fianna Fáil who are relying on the Minister's presentation of Wednesday last, and his presentation today, to be wary of convincing ministerial rhetoric and assertions. To his Fianna Fáil colleagues and those who will vote on this issue on 3 December next, and those who will vote in this House, I say judge the reliability of what the Minister is now saying against the accuracy of what he said in 1983. If they do, they will see substantial reason for concern. On 23 February 1983, the present Minister, Deputy Flynn stated, according to the Dáil Official Report, Volume 340, Column 979: I believe the amendment of the Constitution is not just desirable but essential, because the Constitution does not contain any specific protection for the unborn child... it [the amendment] will reinforce the existing law as we know it and it will guarantee that any future decision regarding abortion or the legalising of abortion, or any [1922] related matter, will have to be done by further referendum... Further on the same debate, exclaiming 'what a magnificent document the Constitution is' the Deputy continued: The insertion of this amendment in the Constitution will mean simply that abortion cannot and will not be made legal either through legislation or judicial decision. Never a man to drop a hyperbole when he spies one on the distant horizon, returning to the same theme on the 2 March 1983, the present Minister stated at Column 1584, Volume 340 of the Dáil Official Report: 'It [the amendment] will act as a magnificent deterrent... to passing down a decision that they [the Supreme Court] will know, by referendum result, does not reflect the minds and the wishes of the majority of our people. It will not be possible then to read abortion into the Constitution... Never has someone been proved so starkly wrong. As for those who expressed concerns about the exact meaning of Article 40. 3.3º and its possible application the present Minister dismissively stated: As far as I am concerned, confusion is one of the main strategies, the main aim of the abortion lobby... they are seeking to impress and impose their aspirations and attitudes on the majority who do not share their permissive latitude in the matter of abortion and any shilly-shallying now or any devise to thwart or confuse or worse to abandon the enabling legislation, as far as I am concerned would be regarded as a victory for the abortionists. I have no doubt that the then members of the Fianna Fáil party in 1983 greatly admired the rhetoric of Deputy Flynn in this House as it was admired in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party rooms last week. Presumably, they equally appreciated the politics of the matter and the ease with which the label 'abortionists'[1923] could be attached to those who then disagreed with Fianna Fáil. No doubt there are some within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party rooms who see the current referendum as yet another opportunity to so label those who disagreed with them. It is remarkable that in the light of the present Minister's track record on this issue, that assertions made by him as to the correctness of the Government's approach can be taken so seriously and that reservations expressed by others can be so easily dismissed. Following the X case there was substantial public discussion about the issues of travel and information, but little if any detailed discussion with regard to the actual application of the main decision of the Supreme Court that is, the decision that under the Constitution abortions can take place here where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. Government comment was confined to a statement that a Cabinet sub-committee was examining the issue and that it would come forward with proposals for legislation and/or a further constitutional amendment. In the light of the strictures by the Supreme Court on the Oireachtas for its failure to enact legislation, following the 1983 referendum, it was widely expected that at the very least detailed legislative proposals would be forthcoming and that there would be a considered and comprehensive public debate. There was a diversity of views about the need for a further constitutional amendment, but if one was proposed it was expected that recognition would have been given to the fact that something more than a simple constitutional prescription was required. Unlike 1983, no Opposition Party was waiting in the long grass to ambush the Government for reasons of political expediency. Unlike Fianna Fáil in 1983, the Fine Gael party did not and have not aligned themselves with any of the lobby groups who address these issues from a narrow and blinkered perspective. It was a cause of astonishment to Fine Gael that the sole Government proposal with regard to this aspect of the problem [1924] is that there now be included in the Constitution an additional Article which is contained in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which states: It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction. Astonishingly, the Government propose to publish no legislation to provide for the detailed implementation of Article 40. 3.3º and this additional provision, despite advice from the Attorney General that it is required. In this, they are not only ignoring what was said by members of the Supreme Court but also ignoring the advice of their own Attorney General. The new Article proposed if incorporated into our Constitution, will have the following effect: (1) It will make express provision in the Constitution for abortion and the termination of pregnancies (2) it will allow an abortion to take place where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of a young girl or woman, but not where there is a real and substantial risk to her health (3) the risk to life will have to derive from an illness or disorder and not from any other source and (4) if a pregnancy poses a risk that the mother may commit suicide an abortion will be prohibited in this State. The document published by the Government as the Attorney General's advice on the day when this proposed wording was made public asserts that: The amendment accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in every respect except suicide. It therefore sets out to negative the decision in respect of suicide but in no other respect. The effect is that where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such as that her life is endangered, the pregnancy may [1925] lawfully be terminated if that is necessary to save her life. Similar assertions were made today by the Minister for Justice. I intend to deal with the issue of suicide at a later stage. I first wish to deal with the statement that the amendment 'accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in every respect except suicide'. The four members of the Supreme Court also were of the view that a pregnancy which posed a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother could be terminated, each expressed this view in a somewhat different way. The only majority judgement of a member of the court to contain an expressed distinction between life and health is the judgement of the Chief Justice which stated: If it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy, that such termination is permissible having regard to the true interpretation of Article 40. 3.3 of the Constitution. Mr. Justice O'Flaherty stated: The law in this State is that surgical intervention which has the effect of terminating pregnancy bona fide undertaken to save the life of the mother, where she is in danger of death, is permissible under the Constitution and the law. The danger has to represent a substantial risk to her life, although this does not necessarily have to be an imminent danger of instant death. Mr. Justice Egan stated: A pregnancy may be terminated if its continuance as a matter of probability involves a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. The late Mr. Justice McCarthy stated: When there is a real and substantial risk attached to her survival, that is, the mother's, not merely at the time of application but in contemplation at [1926] least throughout the pregnancy, then it may not be practicable to vindicate the right to life of the unborn. For many women the constitutional line and distinction expressly drawn between life and health is grossly offensive. However, it is not only offensive but also dangerous and ill-advised. It is a grave error to believe that this distinction can be easily drawn. In discussions which the members of the Fine Gael Party have had with the medical profession it has been consistently stated to us that the timing of certain treatments could be affected by such distinction and that as a result women's lives could be placed at risk. This could particularly apply, for example, with regard to the treatment available to women who suffer from breast cancer or cancer of the cervix. Similar difficulties could arise with regard to the treatment of cardiac disease. Decisions about the treatments which should be given and the timing of such treatments for such illnesses should be left to the medical profession in consultation with their patients, that is, in consultation with the women who are affected by such illnesses. Neither women nor doctors should feel at risk of treatments being withheld for fear of court action being taken by some individual or group. We have already seen in the days since the publication of this wording a substantial conflict between Ministers as to its meaning and intent. Apparently the Minister for Justice sought to put this confusion to rest at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting last Wednesday, in further comment since then and again today in the House. However, I have already learned from the experience of 1983 that what is relevant here is not what politicians believe the wording to mean but what the wording expressly states and the manner in which the courts interpret it. This distinction has rung alarm bells throughout the medical profession and is of substantial concern to many women throughout the State. It is in the context of this distinction that the Fine Gael Party are [1927] concerned that the Government proposal is substantially flawed. It is not correct for the Attorney General to argue that this formulation is one accepted by the court nor is it correct for the Minister to so argue. It is a formulation solely contained in the judgement of the Chief Justice and in so far as that judgement differs between life and health it is not a distinction that the court had to address as a real issue in the case which came before it. It was uncontroverted in the X case that the girl's threat of suicide posed a risk to her life and not to her health. It is extraordinary that the Government should on the strength of what is a single judicial obiter dicta try to incorporate such a rigid distinction in our Constitution without detailed consideration of its implications. It is even more extraordinary that the Minister in his speech today and in comments made by him during the past few days should imply that he could read the minds of the judges in the Supreme Court who made no such express distinction in the judgments they delivered. It is a peculiarly male approach to an issue of huge complexity. Of course, there are only 13 women Members of this House but the docile acceptance of this proposal by the Fianna Fáil women Deputies is extraordinary. I suspect that if the Government introduced legislation into this House which sought to include a provision in our Constitution which expressly allowed medical treatment in circumstances where a man's life was at risk but not his health it would be confronted by a parliamentary riot.;2625697

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Brendan Howlin;The Labour Party;I have nine minutes to contribute to three Bills. That is very restrictive but I will address the issues as best I can. Before the debate was adjourned the Leader of my party described the proposal enshrined in the legislation as a brutal divisive attack on the rights of women and on the idea of a republic. Those are strong words but they are merited in the face of the propositions that are being put before this House and guillotined through in this truncated debate. There is a principle which has overwhelming support in this land, the principle of respect for life, indeed love of life. It defines in a real sense our national characteristic. It has many manifestations. It is manifest in our genuine welcoming of foreigners. Virtually all who come here comment on it. It is manifest in our ability to mix with people abroad. Those who watched television [1991] last week saw the Irish attendance at a football game in Denmark and the way in which Irish supporters are unique in mixing with, welcoming and embracing foreigners. It is manifest in our generosity in the face of tragedy, when we see the outpouring open generous hearts of the Irish people in the face of Somalia or Bosnia Hertzogovina or in other crises that affect this planet. Most especially it manifests itself in our sense of community and in our sense of caring. That principle of love and respect for life has been distorted and perverted by some. It was exploited to railroad this nation in 1983 to insert into our Constitution, into the fundamental law of our land, a form of words which purported to mean, in the words of Deputy Flynn, now Minister for Justice as reported in the Dáil Official Report of 2 March 1983 at Column 1576: that abortion could not be made legal either through legislation or by a judicial decision of the Supreme Court. There was no threat of legalised abortion in Ireland at that time, but that was not good enough. It had to be copperfastening, and what a good job of copperfastening they did. One would expect some modicum of humility from those who got it so badly and awfully wrong in 1983, but not so. They have exonerated themselves from all blame for getting it absolutely and fundamentally wrong. Now it seems that it was the Supreme Court who were at fault. The Supreme Court misinterpreted the views of the Irish people as expressed in the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, or so their view of history goes. They are wrong. Subsequent to the X case, and all that flowed from it, it was clear that in an issue as complex, as difficult and as striven with complications as this, the Constitution is not the place to seek to enshrine such principles. There is one other principle adhered to by the Irish people. They are compassionate. Subsequent to the judgment in the X case it was clear that the Irish people love and respect compassion, and [1992] that compassion engulfed the whole nation earlier this year when a child was impaled on a legal hook put there by well intentioned people who were fundamentally wrong in 1983. There was relief in the country when the Supreme Court judgment was announced and that child was free to act on the advice of her family and medical advisers in her own best interests. From that decision has flown consequences that have these Bills before us tonight. It was a judgment on a hard clear case that captured the imagination of the country. The issues of travel and information are before us because we have to restate this basic freedom which the Eighth Amendment, as subsequently interpreted, removed from Irish women. More than one woman — and there is a Government Minister who is a woman present tonight — has expressed to me their personal outrage at the motion that the idea of free movement has to be put to a referedum of the people and that such a basic right should have to be restated, but that is what we have come to. We have fundamental problems with the wording put forward by the Government on the substantive issue. The Government took six months for internal discussions, presumably with the full backing of the law officers of the land and the advice of the Attorney General's office and such medical advice as deemed appropriate from the Department of Health. Indeed the Minister for Health is a member of the sub-committee. At the end of six months they could not even agree among themselves, and the Progressive Democrats, it is now clear, could not agree with the form of words the sub-committee recommended to Government. However, undaunted by their inability after six months to even build consensus within the Government they presented their set of words to the Opposition leaders and gave them 48 hours in which to make up their minds or come up with a better set of words as long as they meant the same thing. That, apparently, is the Government and the Fianna Fáil view of [1993] consensus. When the form of words was presented to the Opposition leaders with it came a memorandum that purported to be a memorandum of explanation. Within hours of that memorandum being handed over it was being contradicted by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health on television programmes. Confusion was heaped upon confusion when clearly the Government did not know the import and meaning of the words or were unwilling to spell it out in clear detail. The proposed wording makes a fundamental distinction between the health and the life of the woman. Medical opinion, as we have seen in the last week from the letters columns of newspapers and the calls that no doubt everyone of us have been receiving from concerned doctors, is that they do not want to be left as the arbiters of the distinction between a woman's health and life because if they make the wrong decisions they will find themselves before the courts. It is wrong to expect them to do this. The Government's answer to that is that they do not intend to legislate subsequent to the passing of these Bills, if they are passed. A clause which causes concern to those concerned with the issue of women's health and rights is the distinction between mental and physical health. It is a throwback to 40 or 50 years ago that we feel there is no reality about mental health and that mental infirmity or the threat of suicide is some sort of con job that women will pull to get around the view that abortion should only be available when a woman's life is at risk. I believe that the words put before this House are mortally dangerous to women and I appeal even yet, that in the hours of debate to come the compassionate Minister who is present in this House will use here influence with Government to ensure that the substantive issue so-called can be dealt with in a compassionate and generous way by legislating in this House.;2625743

726;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Garret FitzGerald;Fine Gael;In his speech opening the debate the Minister for Justice stressed the duty of the Dáil 'to ensure [2011] that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken'. The Minister added, 'we are not prepared to take any chances where the life of the mother is at stake' However, the reason that in the House we are discussing three further amendments to our Constitution is that in 1983, for opportunist reasons of short term political advantage, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister for Justice in particular as an Opposition front bench Deputy at the time, insisted on the introduction into the Constitution of Article 40. 3.3º, despite the clear warning of the Attorney General of the day that that wording was open to several unintended interpretations. The Attorney General of the time said that one of those interpretations might open the way to the legalisation of the termination of pregnancies incases where such termination had not hitherto been lawful and that another interpretation could prevent the life of the mother being saved in certain instances when under previous law it was protected. In the X case both of those fears were seen to have been realised. On the one hand, a Fianna Fáil Attorney General felt constrained by the Fianna Fáil 1983 wording to seek an injunction to prevent the termination of a pregnancy in the case of a rape victim, in respect of whom the Supreme Court subsequently decided that there was a real and substantial risk to her life as distinct from her health. Here we had a Fianna Fáil amendment pushed through regardless of the warnings as to what it would mean and a Fianna Fáil Attorney General going to the courts to insist that that was what it meant and that the right to life of a woman should not in that case be vindicated. He was turned down by the Supreme Court on that issue, although his right to seek an injunction was accepted. So much for the concern of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the Minister for Justice, to ensure that there would not be the remotest chance of bringing any [2012] provision that would put at risk a woman's life. The warning was there from the Attorney General of the day in the clearest possible terms, reiterated by me as Head of the Government, with the support of all members of the Government, yet the Fianna Fáil Party decided to ignore that and it was their Attorney General who subsequently proved how wrong they were. The Supreme Court decided that a termination of pregnancy was permissible on grounds of a threat of suicide — a decision which the Government are now seeking to reverse, a decision not contemplated by Fianna Fáil at the time of the 1983 Amendment. At the time, Fianna Fáil told us that that could not possibly happen, that there was no possibility of that Amendment facilitating abortion. Both fears put forward by the Attorney General of the day were vindicated in terms of what the Fianna Fáil Attorney General sought to do and in terms of what the Supreme Court decided. Against that background, the Minister comes to the House to tell us of his concern to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken. Nine years ago that was not his concern not was it the concern of his party. Then they were quite unconcerned about the risk to a woman's life that might be involved as put to them by the Attorney General of the day. That legislation was pushed forward, with the consequences we now witness. The party and the Minister who refused to listen to the views of the Attorney General in 1983 and who insisted on forcing through that dangerously ambiguous amendment that the Minister now seeks to put right tell us today that we must take no risks with the life of the mother and that we have a duty to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, put a woman's life at risk. The hypocrisy of those two irreconcilable stances is stunning. But there is worse to come, for the amendment now proposed by the Minister [2013] is patently ambiguous — as I shall demonstrate — and creates fresh doubts in an area in which the Supreme Court had at last, at least and belatedly introduced certainty. The Government propose to introduce ambiguity where the dangerous ambiguity of the 1983 Amendment had been resolved by the Supreme Court. The excuse for the ambiguous words that it is now proposed to introduce is that it is necessary to negative the Supreme Court decision in respect of suicide. This, indeed, was stated by the Minister in his speech to be the only modification of the court's decision that is to be affected. He said: that the amendment negatives the decision in respect of suicide but in no other respect. Leaving aside for the moment the question of whether the suicide case should be excluded and granting for the sake of the argument the legitimacy of this intention—it is a difficult issue which I shall come back to if I have time — the Minister has completely failed to explain why, if this is the sole intention in respect of the substantive amendment, the wording of the amendment, is not confined to this issue, which is in fact addressed only in the final six words. Given that the existing wording of Article 40. 3.3º is to be retained, why has it not simply been qualified by those six words, with whatever linking phraseology may be grammatically required? The addition of four lines of text unrelated to suicide simply has the effect of reintroducing ambiguity into the interpretation of Article 40. 3.3º where that ambiguity has happily been eliminated by virtue of the Supreme Court decision. One can argue as to whether or not the suicide option should be retained — that is a legitimate point of disagreement and people from both sides of the House may disagree within their own parties on that issue — but if that is the only purpose, as the Minister has stated, why do we have four lines of verbiage reintroducing ambiguity where it had been removed by Supreme Court decision? I recognise at least three fresh ambiguities unnecessarily introduced by the unhappily worded initial four lines of the [2014] amendment. Given my experience in 1981 and 1982, when I accepted without legal advice the wording put to me, because, as a non-practising lawyer of now 45 years' standing, I did not recognise any ambiguity in it, and that I subsequently discovered how wrong I was and that the wording that had seemed to me to be innocent and harmless had these dangers, I would have to say, that if I can find only three ambiguities in the proposed wording of this amendment the lawyers and the Supreme Court will undoubtedly find more when they set their minds to it if put to that task by some future challenge, and I have no doubt that they will be. The Minister has referred to two of those ambiguities the word 'necessary' to save life and the phrase 'as distinct from the life of the mother'. I must add a third ambiguity, the word 'save' life. In his speech the Minister endeavoured to allay fears that the amendment 'does not provide adequate protection for women in a situation where there would be a risk of the life of the mother being shortened rather than of her immediate death'. I have several comments to make in this regard. The Minister relates that fear to the use of the word 'necessary' to save life but he does not address the effect of using the word 'save' life rather than 'protect' life, yet, very interestingly, the Minister chooses to use the word 'protect' rather than the word 'save' when he refers to the death of the foetus 'in the course of a medical intervention to protect the mother's life or her health'. That is the word the Minister naturally uses, because in his ordinary language he is concerned with the concept of protecting the life or health of the mother. However, the word used in the text of the amendment is 'save', not 'protect'. Clearly, the word 'save' implies a very direct threat while 'protect' has a much more long term significance. I trust that in due course the Minister will accept an amendment to substitute his own preferred choice of the word 'protect', as evidenced in his speech, for the word 'save' in the Amendment. [2015] The terms in which the Minister addresses the issue of whether the amendment will deal with the danger of the mother's life being shortened are in any event, unsatisfactory. The Minister denies that the threat to life must be immediate for the provision to come into effect and asserts that the amendment will permit a termination where a medical condition would result in an 'early' death. But shortening a woman's life, while not threatening an early death, could cut years off her life. The Minister is careful to avoid that issue. A woman faced with such an alternative cannot avoid it, nor can the doctors who have to decide whether to act and who are left, because of this wording, in a state of doubt and uncertainty as to where their rights and their duties lie. The Minister's wording and his speech leave a woman, and her doctor, in that serious difficulty. It is simply not tolerable that we in this House should enact something with that effect. I stress once again that this and the other ambiguities arising from the word 'necessary' and from the phrase 'as distinct from the health, of the mother' are there because, despite the stated objective being to eliminate the suicide case, the amendment, as drafted, contains four additional lines unrelated to suicide which have the effect of undoing the certainty introduced by the Supreme Court in respect of the rest of the originally ambiguous wording of Article 40. 3.3. Yet, the Minister has not offered any apparent explanation, let alone justification, for this additional ambiguous verbiage. What is it doing there? Why is it there? If suicide is the only concern why put in four lines? If they were in substitution for the original amendment. I could see the sense of it, although I might not agree with it, but adding them to introduce ambiguity when the original amendment is there and the only issue in the original amendment that was found to be unsatisfactory in the clarification by the Supreme Court was the suicide issue. Why then put in four lines of ambiguous [2016] matter and offer this House no explanation why it is being done? The Minister's and Government's approach to an issue which has been in the past so disastrously confused by ambiguities because of their insistence on the original amendment — to which this amendment proposes to add a further rash of ambiguities — is intolerably slapdash. Clearly he and his party have learned nothing from the hash they made of this issue in 1983 in an attempt to pin on this party a label of being proabortion. Despite the evidence of the 'X' case, as to the impossibility of prejudging how the Supreme Court will interpret the constitutional provisions, he has peppered his speech with personal assurances as to what the amendment really means. In the text distributed it is stated: I think I can provide reassurance on this point... It is not the intention of the amendment to affect in any way the degree of probability of risk to life that is necessary to warrant treatment. ... There is nothing in the proposed wording which would change that... There is no basis for such fears. Who does he think he is? What have his intentions or his Government's intentions or his reassurances got to do with the way the Supreme Court interprets legislation? He is not a naive men indeed, he is thought by many to be subtle, though there is a shorter four letter word 'cute' which is used about him from time to time.;2625747

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Garret FitzGerald;Fine Gael;He is not naive no one has ever accused the Minister of being naive. He has been accused of many things — some of them complimentary, some less so — but never of being naive. He knows as well as anybody in this House, and better than most as Minister for Justice, that the intentions and reassurances of legislators are totally irrelevant so far as the interpretation of legislation by our courts is concerned. He [2017] is fooling nobody with the rubbish he produced here today on that subject. Once again, as in 1983, he is storing up future problems and creating fresh uncertainties about the mother's right to life by putting forward a wording which is unnecessary to his stated intention of ruling out the suicide option and which is riddled with ambiguities which no amount of assurances as to the Government's intentions can resolve. I want now to deal with other specific points. The words 'as distinct from the health of the mother' have been described as offensive to women. I do not think any man in this House is so lacking in imagination as to be incapable of imagining what he would feel if, as Deputy Shatter said, such a phrase were used about his health but when it is women's health it is different. I find it hard to understand that the women on the other benches can accept this. The party whip is a powerful weapon—all of us are subjected to it. All of us have gone along with it, with a lack of enthusiasm at times, on matters we were not happy with but they were not vital. I find it surprising that women on the other side can go along with this particular insult and seek to enact it in constitutional legislation. His answer, his reassurances and his intentions on the use of these words are in the text. I would like to read three successive sentences because I have been trying to understand their logic. He states: There is no basis for such fears. Under the amendment women will continue to receive all necessary medical treatment to protect their health. That is one of the reassurances he gives without the slightest idea whether the wording he produces will have that effect. Current medical practice in this regard will not be affected. I do not know whether that is right, nor does he. Under current medical practice the question of termination of pregnancy [2018] only arises where there is a threat to the mother's life. How does he start this synergism with a proposition that under the amendment they continue to receive all necessary medical treatment to protect their health and when he comes to the third proposition of the synergism he can only have termination to protect her life. I would ask Deputies to read those three sentences one after the other. Try changing the order, put the third first and the first last and see what you get. It is rubbish, it is absolute nonsense. It is a contradiction in terms. He does not know what he is talking about. I do not know who wrote the speech but he does not seem to have read it before he came into this House. As I say, he is a subtle man, he is not naive. Had he read it carefully, or even semi-carefully, he would have, I think, reworded that in the interest of his own reputation. He goes on to say that dropping the words 'as distinct from the health', would mean termination when there is no risk to life. Let us try dropping the words and see what we get and see how he reached this conclusion. If you omit the words you say 'It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother...' How does he reach the conclusion to drop the words that have the opposite meaning to those which even the Supreme Court will find they have? I do not think the Supreme Court would find those words to mean anything but what they do. The word 'save' or 'protect' is a problem but in terms of the issue being life, leaving out health, how does dropping the reference to health reintroduce health as an issue? How do the words 'save the life' or 'protect the life'— whichever word is better, and it is essential that one of those words be used —'unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother' introduce the possibility of a termination involving health? Any Minister who puts propositions so directly contrary to their plain meaning to this House and expects in a constitutional [2019] amendment the House to accept it, is not naive but is trying to be too clever by half, which I am afraid is a particular disability this Minister has been known to suffer from since he came into politics.;2625749

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Garret FitzGerald;Fine Gael;I am glad this is entertaining Deputies on both sides of the House. We know from the advice we have had — we sought it from the relevant people in medicine and law—and from what has been stated publicly by representatives of the medical profession that if those words are left in, doctors will be faced with the dilemma as to whether in a given case at the margin of life or health, they will find it more difficult to reach a clear decision. In those circumstances, some, undoubtedly, will feel they must play safe by the Constitution and the law given that the alternative is to commit an offence. If it is unlawful it is not covered by the 1861 Act and the doctor goes to jail. If these words are taken out doctors will be put in a position — and they have told us unambiguously — where they will find it more difficult to take decisions and some at least will feel an obligation in law not to take action in certain cases where the issue is marginal. Surely that is not what this House wants. It is not what the women in this House want. It is not what the men on this side of the House want. Do the people on the other side really want that? Can they have so little conscience, so little regard for the issue of the life of women as to go ahead with this in the face of what the medical profession have said? I do not understand it. I know that in politics we all have to compromise. I have compromised since I entered politics, that is something we all have to do. You get overruled and outvoted and very often in Government —I must not say this because it is against the Constitution—I was outvoted, but I will not say on what. I accepted that and went along with things. There are some [2020] issues which go beyond that there are some issues of conscience. I wish to recall for the House what happened when this matter arose. As a result of the mistake I made in accepting the wording without adequate advice, I found myself at the end of January 1983 being advised by the then Attorney General that if we proceeded with the wording the lives of some women would be put at risk and there was also a possibility of abortion being introduced. I faced my colleagues with this. The Labour Party Ministers had formed a conscientious view on this issue——;2625751

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Garret FitzGerald;Fine Gael;Yes. That says they were wiser than we were. I admit that freely, and have always done so. I called all the Fine Gael Ministers together to discuss the issue. I can tell this House that, faced with the issue of conscience —that by proceeding with the wording, some woman's life might at some time be put at risk — every Fine Gael Minister agreed within 20 minutes that we must change the wording. We knew we would probably be defeated, that the party would be split and that we would be humiliated and damaged politically, but given that some woman's life could be affected we felt we had no choice. That is what happens ultimately when you are faced with a genuine moral issue in politics. This is a genuine moral issue. Is there no one on the benches opposite who has the kind of concern which led us to take that action then regardless of the consequences? Are the party opposite without anyone of conscience, anyone concerned about the issues I am raising, who would walk through the lobbies in defence of them? What kind of a party are they? At times in the past that party served the country well. I have frequently made that case within my party and elsewhere. I find it hard to believe that it has got to the point where no one on the benches opposite is concerned about the issues of life and death with which we are dealing here, that the words do not matter and that ambiguity is unimportant. [2021] It seems to have got to the stage where all that matters to them is that they should try to split the Progressive Democrats or Fine Gael so that they will fail, and that they should buy off the pro-life people. Regardless of the cost, they want to avoid creating any problems for themselves such as disagreeing about the wording by bringing in legislation. The important thing seems to be that they keep the party together. Nothing else seems to matter women's lives do not seem to matter. I find this intolerable. I do not like living in a country where even a party I am not a member of behave like that. I find this intolerable. I do not want to dwell further on that issue. I feel strongly about it and I do not want to pursue it further. Perhaps somebody opposite will have listened to what I have said. I wish to refer to other issues. None of us is without fault in this matter. We are legislating here to export our problems. We are saying we will look after cases where the life of the mother is clearly and unambiguously at stake — as I said, we are trying to do this but not very effectively — but that if it is a question of a threat of suicide, rape or incest we will export those cases. As a people we are concerned about these issues. After all, we are here because of the X case. What was our reaction to the X case? What was the unanimous reaction of the country to that case? People were horrified at that case because of the threat of suicide and the fact that the raped child was not being allowed to have an abortion. It was the shock and horror of that case which has led us to where we are now. What are we doing now? We are saying — none of us is exempt from this — we will deal with the issue which was not really raised in that case, but the British can look after those cases involving suicide, rape or incest. I do not think we are doing ourselves great credit by adopting that approach. I understand and share the concern that if we act differently it will have a divisive effect on our society and we will be giving people who have already done damage to our society a field day. I can understand why we do not want to [2022] face these issues. I also understand that in not facing these issues there will be the other answer whereby people go to England until we get around to being sufficiently mature to deal with them ourselves. I can only say I am not very happy at what any of us are doing in regard to these matters. I believe we all share a common concern in this regard. In cases where the actual issue of life is involved we have to stand firm, even if we are not prepared, to face up to the full implications of everything we are doing and not doing. I appeal to the people opposite to look more seriously at what is involved. They should not play party politics with this issue. As we have shown in the past, this is not an issue for party politics. They should show us that they can measure up to the kind of position we took on the issue. They should show that they are not going to allow party advantage to be the determining factor when genuine issues of life and death are at stake.;2625753
733;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Bernard Durkan;Fine Gael;Unlike the previous and very eminent Members of this House, I cannot say I have looked into my heart to find out what the Irish people are thinking. However, like many of my colleagues on all sides of the House I have tried to find out what is in the best interests of the Irish people, particularly women and children. One must first look at how we have arrived at this position. I agree with the comments made by my colleague Deputy Garret FitzGerald on the events of 1983 and the very cynical attitude adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party. It is clear that they deliberately exploited that situation in the hope of maximising their political advantage and used every possible ploy to ensure that the then Government were made to feel as embarrassed as possible at the situation which was developing. They did absolutely nothing to ensure that there was a rational debate on the issues of concern to people at that time. Rather they did everything possible to exploit the situation from local to national level, with obvious disastrous consequences. It is important to recall the profound [2023] wealth of knowledge and expertise offered to all parties on who was right and who was wrong. We found ourselves in an extraordinary position at that time where two vehemently opposing sides were convinced that they were correct and capable of providing beyond any shadow of doubt that their interpretation of the wording was correct. These people have all now been proven wrong. Having regard to what happened in the past, I do not think anybody can be absolutely certain in this debate that they are right. That is the one lesson we should have learned from the debate which started in 1983 and which was revived during the X case. What are the public saying about this issue at present? I accept that one should not necessarily go along with the populist view one should have one's own opinions and try to impart one's knowledge and experience to the public in the hope of setting them on the right road. Nevertheless we have to listen to what the people are saying. From what I have heard, the majority of people are opposed in principle to abortion. I would go along with that view. The majority of people are equally in favour of freedom of information and the right to travel, and I would certainly go along with those views. Obviously there is a conflict in this area. In view of the fact that the Government partly contributed to the confusion at an earlier stage, I believe it was their responsibility to remove some of the ambiguity in that area. Unfortunately they have not done this: neither will they do it in the debate which will follow. Because they have not tried to get rid of the ambiguity in this area over the past seven or eight years it is highly unlikely that they will change their views now. The public can change their views. In the immediate aftermath of the X case people were very emotional. One must always recognise that emotions are somewhat charged at times like that and that people on both sides will go further than they intended. This is unfortunate. I hope in these calmer times that the Government will take on board some of the [2024] points raised by my colleague, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, and other Members on this side of the House. I hope they will keep in mind also some of the other comments by members of the public. Some of them are advocating that somehow politicians contrived this issue at present to deflect public attention from what they see as more serious issues. In my view the issues involved are of equal importance. Many people complain that there are other serious issues, such as that of unemployment, which have not received the same attention in this House, despite the fact that our unemployment level has reached alarming proportions. This is not my view but that of the people I meet on a daily basis. They regularly make this point and did so quite forcefully to me at a function recently. The question of suicide was a very pivotal issue in the X case. Suicide has been a very tragic and traumatic experience for many Irish families over 1,200 people committed suicide in the past 12 months and that figure is rising. I doubt any Member does not know of somebody who committed suicide. I can think of many families in my constituency who experienced that trauma recently. Having consulted with families who have been affected by the trauma of suicide I have asked myself what can be done about this problem and what are the signs. Usually the person concerned is suffering some stress or worried about something which they have not been able to resolve or discuss openly with another person in order to assuage their fears. That obviously causes problems. There is no doubt that an unwanted pregnancy for a young girl could cause such distress. In years past that certainly was an issue that could not readily be discussed with parents or, indeed, with friends and we have had ample evidence to that effect. It is tragic that that should be the case. I hope something has evolved from that period which will benefit the community at large. Who can decide when suicide is imminent? That is a very difficult and exacting task. There are those in the medical profession who will say that a girl who indicates [2025] she is suicidal in the course of her pregnancy could very well end up committing suicide. However, an equally eminent branch of the medical profession will disagree with that view. Therefore, it is difficult for politicians to make a decision in that regard. The prospect of a pregnancy of a particular type could cause such trauma to a girl or woman as to result in suicide. Then we would be condemned. In the final analysis, the medical profession should be in a better position than most, from dealing directly with the patient concerned, to have a reasonably good idea as to the tendencies of the patient concerned. There will also be situations where members of the medical profession will be able to say that they have attended patients over a period of time and never suspected that they were likely to commit suicide. From my experience, the suicide rate among the male population is at least as high, if not higher, than among the female population. That is not an authoritative statement as I have no evidence to support it other than my own personal knowledge. In regard to the right to life and who should decide, the medical profession should be in the best position to advise a mother. In so doing, their interest should be, first to the right of the mother and, second the right to life of the unborn baby. In regard to the life — as distinct from the health — of the mother, at what stage does the health of the mother lead to a position whereby her life might be in danger? At what stage can the medical profession, eminent though it may be, determine when the health of a person is such that it will deteriorate to a state where the life of that person is in danger? That is crucial and, unfortunately, it is not dealt with in the amendment before us but it was in contributions from this side. I put forward those views not as an expert and certainly not as a medical practitioner, but as one who has dealt with people, as has every Member, who have been traumatised at some stage in regard to this or similar issues. Does the amendment provide for the rights of both [2026] the mother and the child? I do not believe it does. The amendment, by concentrating on the mother's life, seems to have forgotten about her health which could ultimately threaten her life. That is a difficult issue. Nobody or no party should be labelled as abortionists. I certainly am not and neither are my party and I make no apology for expressing my views in this regard. No pregnant woman or girl should have to worry that if something goes wrong during her pregnancy the Constitution might determine whether she lives or dies. The same applies to an unborn baby. I do not understand why the Constitution should suddenly become involved in matters concerning a maternity hospital, a gynaecologist's waiting room or surgery. A consultant should be able to state that in his or her opinion the correct decision was made. They should not have to ask themselves if they are telling the person what is right for them and for their child or what is right for them having regard to what is in the Constitution.;2625754

If we had not had the debate in 1983 I do not think we would have had the problem that arose from the X case. If we had not had those divisive debates in 1983 we would not have had the equally divisive debate on the Maastricht Treaty, which had no bearing on the abortion issue, and the issue of the economic and monetary union became entangled in a debate of this nature. Likewise, this debate should not transgress into the areas to which I have referred. These are my views and the views of many of my constituents who have told me that they are opposed to abortion but in favour of the freedom of information and the right to travel. The issues of the right to travel and freedom of information have arisen as a result of a decision of the [2027] Supreme Court, following on a decision in the High Court, following on the famous debate of 1983. If I could return to that debate for a moment. I do not think that there was any eminent medical and legal expert who at that time did not put forward views which left many of us mere human beings floundering for words in regard to two matters. First, the expert source from which these views emanated and, second, the profound wealth of knowledge with which they put forward their particular opinions. What is sad about that is that they were all wrong. We will now have a further debate on semantics which could be proven wrong in a couple of years time.;2625756

In all seriousness, it is worth noting that women generally, and the women to whom I have spoken throughout my constituency, feel strongly about this issue even though they are opposed to abortion and anything associated with abortion. They do not want abortion at all but they feel resentment, and justifiably so, that the Constitution should say that, in this situation, the patient must now be judged by the medical profession and the practitioner must have due regard to what is laid down in law. If there is an interruption of the pregnancy which does not have due regard to the constitutional requirements, the medical profession are at fault——;2625768

That is farcical and I say that with all due respect to the various opinions. I do not believe we should introduce abortion so that we can boast to the international media that abortion is freely available here. For some unknown [2029] reason we have taken it upon ourselves to include this qualification, and that includes the legal profession, a member of which was sitting across from me a few moments ago, the Supreme Court and the High Court. Incidentally, this House was criticised with a certain amount of justification, for not legislating on this issue. Legislation should have been in place so that everyone would know during the referendum what the position will be as a result of voting in a particular fashion. The present position is that the people will vote in a referendum and if the Legislature is not satisfied with the outcome, it will legislate for what it sees as the failings of the people. That is a very peculiar situation and one with which I have considerable reservations. I do not wish to become embroiled in an argument between the legal and political professions but I hope the debate continues in a rational manner. We must realise the importance of this issue to women who represent over 50 per cent of the population and I hope that when it comes to decision making the Government will have regard to the legitimate views and the deeply held convictions that have been expressed by Members on all sides of the House. The Government might consider allowing the people to make their choice after the legislation has been laid before the House when they have had an opportunity to vet it.;2625770

It is important that we achieve the objectives he has expressed. I welcome this opportunity to participate in this debate and to commend the Government's three Bills to the House and, indeed, to the Irish electorate. The contents of these three Bills reflect several months of careful reflection and preparation by a Cabinet subcommittee. That subcommittee, in turn, drew on the [2030] knowledge and practical experience of a wide range of expert medical and legal opinion before formulating and finalising the proposals now before us. These are proposals which I can fully endorse and support unequivocally, drawing on my own experience of the realities of life in Ireland as it is today. A number of persons, mainly it must be said, from outside of this House, have attacked the Government's proposals from mutually exclusive positions. At one end of the spectrum, our proposals have been denounced as being excessively permissive, amounting in practice to an attack on the rights of the unborn. At the same time, our proposals have been derided with equal vehemence by those who wish to have abortion more freely available in this country. Those of the latter view misrepresent the Government's proposals as a curtailment of women's rights, actual and potential.;2625771

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Tom Kitt;Fianna Fáil;The sole point of consensus common to both extremes is to query the good intentions and basic credentials of Government speakers. I have no hesitation in meeting either such challenge head on. I am as much in touch with public opinion in Ireland as any other Deputy. I say so because of my experience both as a private citizen and as a politician, drawing on my first hand knowledge and experience of the many facets of life in Ireland today, both urban and rural. I was born in rural Ireland and drew some part of my formative experiences from there. My political career is based in Dublin South, an urban constituency with a broadly representative spectrum of the electorate, young, old, affluent and disadvantaged alike. Prior to becoming a full-time public representative, [2031] I was a teacher. I am still in close touch with many of the pupils I taught — now young adults — as well as their parents. I can draw on that wealth of practical experience in coming to debate here today and, in the weeks ahead, in the course of other public debates on this topic elsewhere. It is certainly my intention, if I may borrow a phrase from Abraham Lincoln, to speak with malice towards none and with charity for all. I hope other speakers will operate within the same parameters. The reputation of this Government in terms of the advancement of women in Irish society rests on demonstrable achievement, not just well meaning but unfulfilled aspirations. I believe that considerable progress has been made by this Government in advancing the status of women in our society and I would refute any suggestion that the proposed Amendments go against this trend. Since taking office in 1989, this Government have put in place comprehensive and effective structures to combat inequality. These structures include the explicit assignment of responsibility for the promotion of the position of Irish women to all Government Ministers, within their own areas of responsibility my appointment as Minister of State for Women's Affairs, to complement the activities of all Government Ministers and all Government Departments, by exercising a monitoring and co-ordinating role on all aspects of Government policy as they affect women the re-establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, a committee on which I had the honour to serve and the establishment of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in November 1990, chaired by an eminent High Court Judge, Justice Mella Carroll, and including among its ranks the chairwoman of the Employment Equality Agency, Catherine McGuinness, an eminent lawyer in her own right. It also includes both the chairwoman and chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women.;2625775

Having regard to the very considerable expertise which is available within its membership, its imminent report is awaited with keen interest by all who care about the advancement of women in Irish society. I believe it would be helpful to this debate to remind the House of the types of substantive initiatives which have been taken by this Government since 1989 towards the achievement of gender equality. Some of these initiatives represent important gains for women, yet very often do not attract the level of media attention which they objectively deserve. The types of initiatives I have in mind are the enactment in December 1990 of new legislation on rape which introduces new offences with more severe penalties and abolishes the marital exemption in relation to rape the Criminal Evidence Act which provides protection for the victims of violence in the home, by clearly establishing the circumstances in which the spouse of an accused is competent or compellable to give evidence and the Criminal Justice Bill which provides for the judicial review of lenient sentences. This is a record of demonstrable achievement. It will, I trust, help to put the Government's good faith in relation to the three proposed Amendments into context. In relation to the proposed Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution it is worth emphasising, I believe, at form a mother's viewpoint it is an advancement on the position adopted in 1983, and enshrined in Article 40. 3.3º. That Article provided for the equal right of life of the unborn and the mother, but it [2033] was silent in legal terms on alleviating any threat to the life of the mother. Article 40. 3.3 remains but, for the first time, this proposed Amendment will ensure that, in all life threatening situations, there will not be any legal ambiguity to prevent an expectant mother from getting whatever medical and surgical treatment she needs. It will have the very positive effect of clarifying the legal balance.;2625779

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Tom Kitt;Fianna Fáil;The Supreme Court decision in the X case affirmed the right of the mother to a medical termination of pregnancy where there would be a real and substantial risk to her life if the pregnancy continued. It is important to recognise that the medical condition giving rise to the 'risk to life' need not be absolutely immediate. Medical decisions are taken on the basis of probability. This Amendment will clarify the legal position for doctors and others involved in the medical care of women. The enactment of the Twelfth Amendment will enable them to carry our essential treatment. The proposed Twelfth Amendment is consistent with the Supreme Court decision, except for the exclusion of 'the risk of self-destruction' provision. I [2034] believe that the 1983 referendum demonstrated, clearly, the strongly held wishes of the majority of the Irish people against the widespread availability of abortion, as has been pointed out by Deputy Durkan. It is still not desired nor is public opinion likely to change dramatically in the foreseeable future. Other countries, acting in good faith and motivated by compassion, have permitted the theat of suicide as a grounds for the legal termination of pregnancy. Experience has shown time and time again that such latitude leads to a high incidence of suicide threats and a correspondingly high level of legal abortions. That is clearly a scenario which the vast majority of people on this island, North and South, find morally repugnant and so reject. In line with the best legal advice available, the Government's proposed wording provides for a termination of a pregnancy to 'save the life, as distinct from the health' of a mother. While this may, at first reading, appear severe and an impossible distinction to define it is necessary, from a legal point of view if the Amendment is to stand on its own.;2625784

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Tom Kitt;Fianna Fáil;I hope the Deputy will hear me out. I am talking about the effect of the legal provision. The language is taken directly from the Supreme Court judgement and those who favour the implementation of the Supreme Court judgement, in whole or in part, can scarcely object to the incorporation of that court's language. The phrase 'as distinct from health' must be seen in the overall context of the Twelfth Amendment. That phrase must be coupled with the phrase 'giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life'. The latter phrase does not require, nor did the Supreme Court require, that the risk be immediate. This, taken with the phrase 'necessary to save the life' means that the pregnancy could be terminated if the best medical advice was that, even after childbirth and recovery of the mother therefrom, other treatments [2035] for whatever she was suffering from would be ineffective to save her life. I believe that these referenda must be approached in a calm, rational manner. In comparison with 1983 we are proceeding in a relatively calm and rational manner. I know they are being so considered by many women. Since my appointment as Minister of State for Women's Affairs, I have met and exchanged views with many concerned women on these issues. My appointment in February coincided with the Supreme Court decision on the X case. My European Affairs portfolio afforded me an opportunity to explore the implications of the Maastricht Treaty for Irish women in the context of that decision of the Supreme Court. Those exchanges are fruitful and, I hope, mutually beneficial. These referenda are a fulfilment of the undertaking given at that time that these issues would be resolved, by referendum, prior to the coming into force of the Maastricht Treaty. There have been calls for a postponement of these referenda, for time for further consultation but sufficient time has been afforded to permit debate.;2625786

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Tom Kitt;Fianna Fáil;If some people had their way we would still be debating this in another ten years. Some of the language in the debate on the abortion issue is very offensive to women and to many men. Many of the groups fail to take women's views fully into account and have no answer for some of the situations which [2036] may only rarely arise, where both the woman and the unborn child will die in the absence of life-saving medical treatment for the mother. There is no medical consensus that such situations can never arise. What I regret is that many so called pro-life campaigners will not admit in public what are the consequences of this position. There is no room for extremism in this debate. The Government amendment will afford protection to the mother by ensuring her entitlement to any treatment necessary to save her life. It is pro-woman and reflects the views of the majority of the people who, I am certain, are not prepared to see their wives, sisters or mothers die for the sake of dogma. I support this proposed Twelfth Amendment and I make no apology to the zealots, lacking basic human compassion, who would stand back self-righteously and refuse medical intervention to a pregnant woman whose life is at risk. Charity, surely, is the greatest of virtues? Neither do I yield to those who see abortion on demand as an expression of social justice. Those who would sanction widescale abortion as a remedy or solution to women's problems are, in effect, attempting to make the unborn pay the price for injustices inflicted by others. That is contrary to social justice and an affront to the strongly held moral convictions of the vast majority of people in this country. The Government's proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in relation to the right to travel is the least contentious of the three proposed Bills. The positive consensus in this House towards the terms of this Amendment is a reflection of the reality that the right to travel is a basic human right which can and should be exercised freely by every citizen irrespective of class, creed or gender. While the underlying thrust of this Bill may have merits evident to all of us, it is, nonetheless, essential for the Government to go on record to allay fears formented by some individuals and organisations outside of this House and to dispel any possible ambiguities. The general consensus on the right to travel should not induce any complacency [2037] on our part. Anything less than a wholehearted endorsement of that constitutional right will send out a very negative image of Ireland to the world. To attempt to curtail the rights of any sizeable number of our citizens to travel between this State and another would necessitate the creation of an extremely authoritarian regime — in essence, a police state. No one can seriously suggest that we should attempt to curtail the right of Irish women to travel unless we wish to regress socially, economically and culturally to the unhappy level in which the people of Albania found themselves until relatively recently.;2625792

This is philosophically repugnant to me and, I am sure, to the entire House. Its anti-woman basis does not merit or require detailed rebuttal. We are here mandated in Dáil Éireann as legislators, acting for and on behalf of the electorate. We have a duty and obligation to legislate in the best interest of all our people and for those reasons I commend this Amendment to the House. It is an Amendment which bears out the good faith of the commitments which the Taoiseach and I gave in course of many meetings with women's groups during the course of the Maastricht referendum campaign. The Thirteenth Amendment is positive proof that we have kept faith with those undertakings. I turn now to the Fourteenth Amendment which will enhance the right to information in our Constitution. A right to information is a general principle enshrined in many written constitutions throughout the world. That principle is also set down in general terms in the charters of various international agencies, including the United Nations and the Council of Europe. [2038] The right to information is a fundamental necessity in the fair administration of justice, in the process of facilitating freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association. As long ago as 1948, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrined a right to 'seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers'. As with all general principles, individual rights cannot be exercised in an unlimited way in a democratic society. Restrictions may and are sometimes necessary on various grounds, including public health and morals and protecting the rights and freedoms of others. The wording which the Government are commending to the electorate by way of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment reflects the reality of that constraint. The enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment will enable people who may contemplate an abortion abroad to make an informed choice with the help of non-directive counselling. Any serious analysis of the factors which bring women to have recourse to abortions must be wide ranging and comprehensive. The problem cannot be tackled unless the root causes are identified, analysed and dealt with in a logical, rational and determined manner.;2625794

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Tom Kitt;Fianna Fáil;Access to objective, impartial information in relation to abortion is not simply exclusively a matter for pregnant women. It is a matter which should and must concern their partners and their families. The wider community, including voluntary and statutory organisations, must also take a more proactive role in counselling women who consider abortion as an option. It is my sincere hope, a hope which is shared by all sides of this House, that access to non-directive counselling on the abortion question will actually help to reduce the incidence of abortion. Society must make a concerted [2039] effort to alleviate or remove the various pressures which induce women to seek abortions. These three proposed Amendments were drawn up by the Government to meet the needs of Irish women as we near the end of the 20th century. The Amendments have been drawn up with care and taking cognisance of the best legal and medical advice available. Anyone who proposes to dismiss them, either for short term political gain or because they care more for ideology than the alleviation of human suffering, has a moral obligation to produce a better alternative. I doubt very much if any such better alternative will be forthcoming, now or in the near future. I commend, therefore, these three Amendments to this House.;2625796

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;F;Ms. Nuala Fennell;Fine Gael;As the first women speaker in this debate, for the information of the Minister of State for Women's Affairs, I would like to put on record the extensive degree of anger and resentment that is being felt by women outside this House because once again their needs and issues are to be manhandled in a most despicable way in this House and throughout this debate. There is a great deal of anger not just among feminists but among women who perhaps in 1983, voted in favour of the Amendment. Women are angry because so much confusion has been created and there has been so much ambivalence by the Government on this issue. The Minister will find that this will manifest itself in the very surprising vote against this proposed Amendment. What we are doing here is most regressive. We are putting another constitutional policeman on women's lives. I know the political, legal and medical objectives of this exercise are represented as a measure to protect the foetus, or at least to protect it more than [2040] it is already protected in our laws and by our existing constitutional provisions. However, we are doing this in a society whose entire value structure and ethos is pro-life in the truest sense. Broadly speaking, we celebrate and enjoy our children. We welcome new life into our families. We put a high premium on family support and family happiness and we have the highest ratio in developed countries of mothers who opt to stay at home and make sacrifices in terms of their own interests and their own professions to be closely involved in the care and rearing of their young children. There is no ambivalence on this. No one wants, nor would promote nor work for the idea of easy abortion in this country. The notion is so far-fetched as to be ludicrous. However, there are plenty of people who now realise that we must make provision for legal abortion in certain limited circumstances. The issue of abortion is no longer a black and white issue. The campaign that follows this vote presumes that an 'abortion on demand' regime is highly likely, in fact, is just around the corner if this Amendment is not passed. To this end we will be intimidated, frightened, even threatened into voting 'yes' to another insertion of irrelevant and simplistic words into our Constitution and most voters may not even know or understand what these words mean or how they might be interpreted by doctors, or, in the longer term, by the courts. They are dangerous words and I sincerely hope that all sensible people, men and women, who care for the health and lives of their daughters, their sisters, their mothers, their wives will reject that. I am convinced that many people will realise that this debate is more about manipulation of the political process for Fianna Fáil Party gain than about reassuring women or securing their rights. Personally I find aspects of this debate very unacceptable. I believe nothing whatever will change in regard to our abortion statistics after our speeches here or after the campaign or after the vote. All we will do is bring greater medical [2041] uncertainty into the whole area of pregnancy and childbirth. Our deliberations are negative in the extreme. This debate is, more than anything else, about controlling women. It is about restricting their powers. It is about taking away their integrity and their right to make decisions about their lives. At many points the debate is fuelled by threads of traditional misogynism, contributed to by people who regard women as 'less equal' than men, undeserving of equal rights. These people cannot change their idea of women as objects and breeding machines that can be manipulated and controlled through law, practice and custom. This debate is masquerading as a solemn attempt to restrict abortion in Ireland and it is being railroaded through by a party that is showing itself to be totally insensitive to the views of women, to their organisations, to the doctors who have serious reservations about the likely outcome of the proposals. I regret that what is happening now is a direct replay of the Fianna Fáil role in the referendum of 1983 when, under the leadership of Deputy Charles J. Haughey, that party aligned themselves, with the full and active support of many of the people still sitting opposite, with narrowminded, fundamentalist groups like SPUC, PLAC and the Knights of Columbanus. They took the high moral ground and collaborated in bullying the electorate into a most inappropriate and misguided vote. All chance of reasonable argument was sacrificed to intense emotion and bitter division during the entire campaign. The reasonable proposals for alternative wording put forward by Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach, and Mr. Peter Sutherland, the Attorney General, were rejected. They warned that the Fianna Fáil proposal would lead to Supreme Court challenges. They warned that it would restrict freedom of travel and they warned that it would inevitably lead to legalisation of abortion here. We have lived to see this happen. Earlier this year the whole country lived through the awful trauma of the High Court and Supreme Court cases involving a young pregnant girl. The vast [2042] majority of people opposed what was happening to her and her family. It was only when we saw how this girl was trapped in this country by an injunction of the High Court, coping with a pregnancy that was life-threatening, her family powerless to help her, that we realised the full extent of the inadequacy of Article 40. 3.3º. of our Constitution. If the so-called X case and the varying interpretations of the 1983 amendment have shown us one thing with clarity it must surely be the impossibility of reducing to a sentence or two a concept of such complexity and variability that it will be different in every set of human circumstances in which it arises. This is a matter which should have no place in the Constitution. It requires a detailed and graduated framework which can only be provided in legislation. At this point I would appeal to the Government to change course, to put whatever differences exist between us in this House behind us and make the right decision now, that is, to introduce legislation first and let people know exactly what they will be voting for and the likely implications of their vote. How can Members of this House once again turn their backs on the criticism levelled at us by the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy for our failure to give legislative effect to the 1983 amendment? Perhaps one can understand to some extent why this House never went back to necessary legislation which was left in abeyance after the 1983 amendment. We were, perhaps, paralysed into inaction by the dreadful hostility, the dreadful bitterness, the dreadful division which we ourselves created through our divisive approach to the 1983 amendment. It was very unpopular to question the lack of legislation and people just stayed away from it. It was as if people were afraid they would get burnt. We now see the havoc wreaked as a result of that. It was the wrong approach. In the last few weeks I have listened to many consultants and gynaecologists and have heard their real concerns and confusion. Unlike 1983, on this occasion we have had the benefit of the considered [2043] views of many eminent consultants. I would like here to commend Dr. Mary Henry for her responsible and clear enunciation of issues on the media in recent weeks. There are many more doctors who feel equaly strongly but who, for reasons of their employment conditions or fear of public hassle, are unable to speak out. Many of them have made their views known privately to the Taoiseach. One such group of 12 eminent consultants contacted me privately to express their very real fears and their opposition to what is happening. Surely these fears must be recognised and cannot be dismissed. One man from the Opposition benches, Deputy McDaid, has publicly expressed his reservations despite his party's opposite policy and despite considerable local vilification of himself. In an Irish Times article he wrote: Until it can be proven otherwise, I am firmly of the opinion that rare cases can occur where the prolonging of a pregnancy puts the life of the mother very seriously at risk. These would include such conditions as serious cardiac disease, congenital and otherwise, and cancers in which metastasis is greatly intensified by pregnancy. Early termination of pregnancy seems to me to be indicated in such cases and should, I believe, be done here. In the same article Deputy McDaid said: I strongly believe that if even one case should occur every ten years where the life of the mother can only be saved by a termination of pregnancy then a total constitutional ban would be very wrong indeed. Such a ban could only be justified in my view if medical science were advanced to the stage where we could guarantee that no woman's life would ever be seriously threatened by pregnancy. I want all doctors dealing with pregnant women to be confident and sure that they will be able to freely diagnose according to the total needs and interests of that [2044] woman's life and health. Women are entitled to know that the doctor carrying for them, with their best interests at heart, will be free from constraints under Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. What we do here must be clear and specific we must not contribute to a sense of suspicion and mistrust within the medical world and to an atmosphere in which self-appointed moral guardians in hospitals could indirectly influence a woman's treatment in a way which is inconsistent with what her medical doctor recommends and wants. Let me quote an instance which is allied but not directly concerned with this subject. Such a thing happened in a Dublin hospital in 1985 when I was hospitalised for a hysterectomy operation. A woman patient came into my room to tell me about her experience. She, too, had been admitted for such an operation having had severe bleeding for many months. She was 35 years old and had four young children. Both herself and her husband, along with her consultant had fully discussed and accepted the need for her operation. Despite that fact when that woman was under the anaesthetic in the operating theatre a theatre nurse intervened and challenged the surgeon saying that this woman was still of child bearing age and as far as she, the nurse, was concerned her symptoms did not warrant radical surgery. At that time the surgeon was in no position to argue in the tense environment of an operating theatre. He could not assert his right over his patient and so the operation never took place. The woman was brought back to her bed without having the operation that she so badly needed carried out and told me that she was in the process of making plans with her surgeon to transfer to another hospital so that this necessary operation could be carried out. I should say that I found this to be intolerable interference by a third party in a decision that was taken privately between doctor and patient but I wonder whether this was an isolated incident or can this type of action still happen in our hospitals perhaps indeed with conditions [2045] of a more serious nature than a hysterectomy needing treatment. I could perhaps put the matter in context if I propose in an exaggerated way to the men present in the House that they should reflect for a while on how they would feel if such a thing were to happen to them while on their backs in the operating theatre waiting for an operation for testicular cancer or some such operation and a third party in the operating theatre said that the operation could not take place because they were still capable of having children. I accept that I am exaggerating and that one cannot have a direct parallel but I ask them to think about this question where a woman is in an operating theatre having made her decision and believes that an operation is going to be carried out and someone else intervenes. Indeed, it says something about the system that a third party can have the confidence to intervene. Similar arguments apply regarding the issue of women and suicide. This should be a matter between a woman and her medical adviser and I reject the notion that a threat of suicide from pregnant women could or should be regarded as a frivolous threat and excluded from the amendment. I fail to understand the basis for this decision and find it both cruel and insensitive. Would the Government accept that their thesis will disintegrate, morally and ethically, when the first pregnant woman or girl does commit suicide? I do not want to examine my conscience if that happens because of a decision taken in this House. What I would like to know is what consultation did the Government have on this issue before arriving at this wording. We are entitled to know the answer. Did they examine the considered views of psychiatrist Dr. Anthony Clare as quoted in the Irish Independent of 17 October? These have been quoted by other speakers. He said that the Government decision failed to take account of the mental state of a minority of women who were particularly at risk because they might be under age or victims of rape or violent abuse. He further rejected accusations that taking account of the [2046] suicide risk would lead to an open door abortion policy and suggested that risk could be strictly interpreted in line with the cultural and ethical views of the country but that the Government's position seemed to be that psychological ill-health and suicide were out of the question as grounds for abortion and that to even consider such things in a professional and skilled way was impossible. He further said that the thin edge of the wedge argument had been widely used and accepted as if trained psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers were not to be trusted to judge someone in a precarious suicide state who was pregnant. It appears that, like most doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists, women are not to be trusted to make decisions about themselves. In the same article Dr. Clare said that in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment he and a medical colleague carried out a study of literature on suicide and pregnancy. They had established that the risk of suicide was lower in pregnant than non-pregnant women but it was not the majority they were concerned with but the minority of women who were particularly at risk and that the most recent review showed that the rate of suicide was higher among pregnant teenagers than in other age groups. Let me turn for a few moments to deal with the other proposed amendments. The amendment dealing with the right to information is generally welcomed but I would add the proviso that the conditions to be laid down in law to give effect to it must be made known in advance and should have been made known prior to this week. I am uncertain as to the reason we need conditions surrounding the right of women to information about a very important and intimate issue. We need to know how restrictive this information is going to be and the reason it is restrictive. We also need to know if it will be broadly spread as outlined by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, on Olivia O'Leary's programme on RTE recently. According to the Minister that night, there would be no censorship of magazines or newspapers and that facts and information would be readily and [2047] easily available. I am sure most people would agree that this is perfectly satisfactory but we need to have express information about that matter before we vote on this issue. Finally, let us consider the reality of our abortion problem. We have to accept frankly and honestly that, despite the constitutional ban, the information blackout and considerable hostility, these figures are rising every year. The fact that the abortions in question are carried out in England does not change the equation. Given our present approach we are effectively denying the great difficulties of these women and banishing them to find their solutions in other countries instead of trying to understand the circumstances which forced them to have foreign abortions, every one of which is a terrible human tragedy. We need to know the conditions surrounding the departure of every women who makes her decision such as her attitude to contraception, her financial and social needs, her relationship with the father of her child, who it was who helped her make her decision, who her advocates were, what counselling she received before and after the abortion, if any. I am aware that the Department of Health consider that they have no role to play in regard to these women, who do not even exist as recorded statistics. This has to change because unless we know the circumstances surrounding these women's lives we cannot begin to help them and reduce the number of abortions. There are many things we need to do and these have been outlined already by other speakers from this side of the House. We need to help the women concerned with their exported social problems and reduce the number of people who have to go to England for abortions. We also need to introduce proper sex education in schools with a special focus on boys and young men to instil in them the need to adopt a responsible approach to sexual activity and parenthood. There should be a contraceptive advice service, aimed specifically at young men and women, as well as a pregnancy counselling [2048] programme. I deeply regret that the Minister in his speech today did not deal with these issues. He gave no indication of the practical action the Government might take on contraception, research and counselling. That is an indication that once the referendum is over women will once again be left high and dry and nothing more will be done. The reason we need proper research programmes — I would stress this — is that most of the research that is available deals with abortions in America and the UK where totally different structures exist. Such research cannot be used here to measure the psychological distress of women before and after abortion. We need follow-up studies as well as examining all the factors which contribute to the decision to abort. In this context I would refer to the briefing document which all of us received from the Psychological Society of Ireland which indicates the need for research and the fact that we have to find out information on many matters that have been already examined and analysed in other countries about the women in question. I recommend this very useful briefing document. As someone who has worked for 25 years in all areas of reform for women I passionately reject this amendment and I will be asking voters to do the same.;2625798

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;F;Mrs. Theresa Ahearn;Fine Gael;It is worrying, although not amazing, that even before the debate on the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution Bills had started in this House the public at large were already fed up with the issue. Almost everybody I have met in the past few days said that they switch off the radio and television when the subject is being discussed. The reason for this is clear: the public are confused. They are disillusioned with the manner in which this most fundamental and serious issue of the right to life is being hastily [2049] introduced and passed through the Dáil. The extent of the confusion, misapprehension and misunderstanding that exists among the people should surely be a warning signal to the Government that it is vital at this stage to have an adequate, proper and detailed debate in this House in an attempt to clarify the enormous clouds of fear and the questions that have arisen. Had the Government properly understood what they were about to impose on the people it would at least have helped to avoid the misunderstanding that now exists. It is blatantly clear that not even all the members of the Government have the same understanding of the proposed wording to deal with the substantive issue of abortion. This is totally inexcusable and is the reason the public are clueless as to what is the precise meaning of the amendments that will be put to them on 3 December. Now that the Government have created the confusion — they alone have caused it — surely it is reasonable, if not logical, to conclude that the only means whereby some degree of clarification can be provided is by allowing a very detailed and lengthy debate in this House on the issue. The Government's approach to this important issue is disappointing if not unacceptable. Having created such confusion they are now compounding their mistake with a blatant and dangerous kind of dictatorship, ignoring the genuine and sincere concerns of all the Opposition Parties. The outcome of the Government's actions will be that the people of Ireland will be forced to vote on a wording that has not been clarified and in relation to which they have been given no reasonable chance to discover its precise meaning. This is grossly offensive it is unfair and unjust. To ask the people to vote in the dark is the same as giving them no vote at all. The real questions that must be answered are: why does the referendum have to be held on 3 December and why is it more important to the Taoiseach to get the issue out of the way rather than to get it right?;2625801

Most of all, why are the lives of women and the unborn not worthy of a full serious discussion to avoid the dilemmas of the recent past? Do the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government not realise that it took nine years to interpret the precise meaning of the wording of the 1983 amendment, yet the Government expect the present wording to be fully debated and outlined in three days? No human right is more fundamental or important than the right to life. Fine Gael as a party are and always have been opposed to abortion. It is interesting that during the debate this afternoon the Minister, Deputy Flynn, stated that there are some who support abortion on demand and no consensus could be achieved with them. To whom is the Minister referring? He is obviously referring to somebody in the House. Is he referring, perhaps, to some of his own backbenchers? I demand that he clarify this matter. He must know to whom he is referring, otherwise why would he make such a statement? That kind of dangerous statement must not be left unqualified and the Minister should ascribe it to those to whom he believes it applies. I respect the sincere and compassionate attitude of my colleague, Deputy Nuala Fennell, to the question of whether suicide should remain as an issue in determining whether abortion should be allowed.;2625803

However, I would personally find it extremely difficult to believe that it is possible to administer a law or a constitutional provision which would provide for those cases as outlined without the fear of abuse. The complexities of the issue are outlined by the varying views held within the parties, but that [2051] does not lessen the degree of compassion and understanding I have for those cases. Fine Gael believe that the substantive issue of abortion cannot be justly or correctly addressed without legislation. The six mark question is, and we have not been able to get an answer to it, why is the Taoiseach so reluctant or indeed downright opposed to legislation on this issue? Is it because he fears he cannot bring his own backbenchers with him through the process? The request by Fine Gael for legislation is a reasonable, logical and balanced one. Our objective is to ensure detailed explanations on the meaning of the proposed amendments. It is basically irresponsible to knowingly and willingly leave in the hands of the medical and legal professions the duty to interpret the amendment without any attempt by the legislators to clarify by legislation the interpretation of the proposed wording. The overwhelming majority of the people on this island do not want to see abortion available generally here. We had hoped that the Taoiseach would deal with this difficult social issue in a very honest and open way.;2625805

The reality is that so difficult and complex is the issue of abortion that it cannot be dealt with by the insertion of a new sentences in the Constitution. One attempt has failed, sadly we cannot hope that the present attempt will be other than a failure also. It is astonishing that the Government do not propose to publish any legislation, particularly as the advice of the Attorney General was to provide legislation. Fine Gael believe that prior to a referendum being held on the substantive issue detailed legislation addressing the difficulties involved should have been brought before the House for discussion by the Government. I would ask, why a different approach is being taken on this issue from the approach that will be adopted on the [2052] issue of divorce? There is no justificable reason for proceeding in the manner as outlined by the Government. Finally, as I pointed out earlier, there is considerable conflict among Government Ministers as to the meaning and the intent of the proposed amendment. It has caused alarm among the medical profession and concern to many women throughout the country. It is alarming that even at this early stage of the debate such conflict and confusion is evident. The lives of women and of the unborn should not be subjects for political gains. The problem of abortion should be recognised for its complexities simplistic constitutional solutions have never been, and never will be, the answer. Tragically, the Government, by refusing to provide comprehensive legislation, are abdicating their constitutional duty. We must avoid, as far as possible, the options which so many have to choose, the option of abortion. In those cases there is an urgent need to provide better support, advice services, information on the choices and options available to women, counselling and care. Adoption should be encouraged and people should be informed of that option. After all, 10 per cent of couples are infertile. Who will speak for them? Why not devote time and resources towards providing the back-up support which would limit the numbers opting for abortion? This would be a positive response to a sad and serious problem. It is unwise and reckless for the Government to push these Bills through the House with unnecessary haste. They will regret their outrageous, impetuous decision but, sadly, in the meantime I hope no one will suffer as a result of their actions.;2625807

Sheehan;Fine Gael;The Government are shying away from their responsibilities, which is to solve the problem of unemployment and lack of jobs. They are very lucky in being able to distract the people from our true situation. We are living in cloud cuckoo-land by asking the people to decide on this issue. I know it is a vital issue to the well-being of our community but it overshadows the real issue of unemployment. I wish to remind the Ministers of State — and the Minister for Health — that the situation in Ireland is as serious as it is in Great Britain. We are told that the recession there has deepened to a depression. God knows there will be a major depression in this country after 3 December because everybody knows that the issue being put before the people is a smokescreen for [2054] the more serious problems affecting our economy. It is difficult to understand why the Government have embarked on this course. Each section in the Amendment is meant to approve of abortion, one way or the other. Let nobody think differently. The Government are wolves in sheeps' clothing. All abortions should be rejected by the people. Why did the Government not have the courage to put before the people a formula which required a simple 'yes' or 'no'? Why will three ballot papers be required?;2625814

The Government are merely clouding the issue. The question of abortion should be buried once and for all to ensure that it will never again raise its ugly head in the Dáil or in the country. As I said, the electorate do not have a choice. I wonder if the Taoiseach will have a mandate from the Dáil to introduce legislation when the electorate reject the amendment. Many Deputies across the House will have the courage of their convictions to speak up for the people whom they represent and they will make sure that he does not put through legislation which will lead to abortion being made available. There are many men and women in the Government parties who will ensure that abortion will never be tolerated——;2625816

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. P. J. Sheehan;Fine Gael;Fine Gael are unanimous on this issue. There is no record of any woman in this country losing her life for lack of medical attention while [2055] expecting a child. Expectant mothers were treated by the medical profession without consulting anyone. If there is a right to life in the womb the mother also has a right to life. This medical procedure was practised down through the years and it was practised very well. I recognise no reason that we should now go back and make abortion in this country legal, even on a limited basis. As I have said, this issue has clouded more important issues confronting the country. It has kept people's minds off the major issues. I should like to share with the House a quotation relating to the 1861 legislation. Treatments were lawful under the 1861 Act even when their indirect result was the loss of an unborn child, since that Act forbids only action taken with intent to procure a miscarriage. The established medical practice of more than a century has always allowed mothers to be fully and properly cared for during pregnancy. It is important to realise that a mother may not be denied treatment because of possible but undesired and unintended consequences for her baby, even in some cases resulting in death. Treatments intended to protect the life of the mother and not involving any direct attack on her unborn child have always been ethically and lawfully proper, even though the loss of a child may follow as an unsought and unwelcome side effect. That statement clearly outlines the powers that exist under the present administration. I really think that the issues now put before the people will cloud their minds to such an extent that they will not even go out to vote, and I have heard decent, responsible electors in my constituency say that they will not exercise their vote in the referenda.;2625820

O'Connell (Deceased);The Labour Party;I propose for the main part of my contribution to this important debate to address the proposed Twelfth and Fourteenth Amendments, that is, those on the substantive issue and on freedom of information. In 1983 Article 40. 3.3º amended the Constitution to state that: the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. Arising out of the X case earlier this year the Supreme Court decided that under the wording of Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution, an abortion is permissible if there exists a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother. They also accepted that such a real and substantial risk existed in the case before them because of the threat by the pregnant woman to commit suicide.;2625825

806;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Dr. John F. O'Connell (Deceased);The Labour Party;As a member of the Cabinet subcommittee set up to deal with the implications of this decision, I have had the opportunity, with my colleagues, to examine very carefully all the options open to the Government, taking account of very extensive legal and medical advice. I believe, for the reasons which I will now outline, that the proposed wording for the Twelfth Amendment represents the best and most balanced solution to a very complex set of issues. The Government's intention in relation to the Twelfth Amendment, that is, the amendment on the substantive [2057] issue itself, can be expressed very simply: it is to protect the right to life of the unborn child subject only to ensuring that a doctor may carry out whatever treatment is necessary to resolve a life-threatening medical condition of the mother. Thankfully, maternal deaths are now very infrequent in developed countries. In Ireland there are, on average two to three known maternal deaths per annum. This figure, related to the number of births, compares favourably with the rates in the UK and the US and the majority of our EC partners, and reflects a very good ante-natal care and obstetric service. Nonetheless, there are medical conditions which have the potential to cause a risk to the life of the mother during pregnancy. These can be divided into three categories. First, certain conditions are directly associated with the pregnancy itself. These include haemorrhage, toxaemia, pulmonary embolus and infection. In most cases it is possible to treat the condition without losing the foetus. However, another condition in this category, ectopic pregnancy, is potentially a very serious situation which may be fatal for the mother unless there is prompt surgical intervention. The second category includes life-threatening conditions which are not related to the pregnancy but which may be exacerbated by it. These include cardiac disease, hypertension and kidney failure. Deputies will be aware that medical opinion is divided as to whether circumstances can arise in which the termination of the pregnancy would be the only effective option to save the mother's life. The third category includes certain other medical conditions which cannot be treated without causing or risking the loss of the foetus. Examples of such conditions include cancer of the womb, breast cancer and brain tumours. Much of the public debate in this whole area has revolved around drawing a distinction between types of life-saving treatment of the mother. As a doctor and as a legislator, I believe very strongly that any treatment which is necessary to save the mother's life must be seen as having that objective as its definitive intent. As far as I am concerned, the term [2058] direct abortion has no relevance to a situation in which a doctor sets out to treat a life-threatening medical condition in an expectant mother. To me, the concept of direct abortion is relevant only when an abortion is carried out for other reasons, so that the primary intent is to end the pregnancy rather than to save the life of the mother. The problem with using the term 'direct abortion' in the way that it has been used by some groups can be particularly well illustrated by looking at ectopic pregnancy. There are two possible approaches to the treatment of this condition, both of which result in the loss of the foetus. The first involves the removal of the fallopian tube, with the foetus. The second involves removal of the foetus alone, so that the fallopian tube is preserved and the woman has a better change of becoming pregnant again in the future. To make a distinction between direct and indirect terminations implies that the first treatment, which involves removing the tube, is acceptable because the loss of the foetus is in some way a side-effect whereas the second treatment is not acceptable. I am afraid that the logic of this argument escapes me completely. The need for treatment arises only because of the location of the foetus, and the sole purpose of the treatment is to remove the foetus in order to save the woman's life. We can then go to ask how it could possibly be considered less acceptable to achieve the same end, where this is medically possible, without having to remove the fallopian tube, so that the mother has a better chance of conceiving again, given that under either form of treatment the foetus is lost. Let us now consider a different type of medical crisis — an expectant mother suffering from rheumatic heart disease who is at risk of cardiac failure during pregnancy. It is of course the case that medical opinion differs as to whether it will arise in practice that a woman's life may be lost through heart failure where the termination of her pregnancy would have averted this. Deputies will have heard expert opinions on either side. [2059] There are few black-and-white certainties in medicine, and it is very difficult to assert categorically that such a situation could never arise in an individual case. Let us assume that, in an individual case, the expert medical opinion is that, on the balance of probability, the continuation of the pregnancy will pose a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman. Her doctors will, of course, have considered every possible alternative option. If it is the case that none of the alternatives can save her life, her doctors may consider, in consultation with the patient herself, the possibility of termination of the pregnancy in order to save her life. In my view, such a decision would have to be made on the same basis as that in the case of the ectopic pregnancy — the objective and intent of the treatment is to save the life of the woman. The examples I have quoted show the dangers in trying to frame an amendment based on terminology such as 'direct' and 'indirect' termination in a situation where the life of the mother is at serious risk. I would like to put a question to those opponents of the proposed amendment who have argued that the wording should be more restrictive. The question is: if an individual patient suffering from a heart condition can only be saved by means of a termination of her pregnancy, is it their preference that she be left to die? As far as I can see, the only response so far to such questions is to deny that such a possibility could arise. I can only describe this as avoiding the question. It cannot be stated that such a situation could never arise, because expert medical opinion cannot agree that this is so. I believe that the vast majority of the Irish people would be appalled at the suggestion that a woman in such a situation should be left to die, and that they would wish to see her receive whatever treatment was necessary. The Government's wording is designed to ensure that, if it should ever be necessary in an individual case, the medical profession [2060] has at its disposal whatever means are necessary to save the life of the woman. I must reiterate that it is my view, and the view of the Government, that it is wholly inappropriate to use the term 'direct abortion' in the context of such treatments. Indeed, I would imagine that any woman who was unfortunate enough to have to suffer the loss of her expected child, as well as having to battle with a life-threatening illness, would be deeply hurt by the callous and unfeeling use of such terminology by those who should know better. There has, of course, been criticism of the wording also from those who feel that it is too restrictive, and it has been suggested that it could in some way weaken the protection available to the life of the mother under existing medical practice. Much of this criticism has focused on the phrase 'life, as distinct from health'. It has been suggested, for example, that the wording would only permit a termination of pregnancy where the risk to the life of the mother was either immediate or certain. Neither of these interpretations is correct. The Government have been advised that the wording does not require the risk to be immediate. If the doctors believe that unless the necessary treatment is given now, there will be no other effective way of saving the mother's life at a later stage, they may proceed with the treatment even though the death of the foetus may result.;2625827

O'Connell (Deceased);The Labour Party;In relation to certainty, normal medical practice can only operate on the basis of probability — there are no certainties. The Supreme Court's test referred to the establishment, as a matter of probability, of the real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, and the proposed wording is consistent with this. It follows therefore that all current medical practice in this country will continue to be permitted under the wording. The Government gave very careful consideration to the suggestions that the [2061] phrase 'as distinct from health' should be omitted. Unfortunately, the inclusion of this phrase seems necessary to avoid a possible future interpretation that health unrelated to a life-threatening condition was a ground for abortion. The Government believe that such an outcome, which has in other jurisdictions led effectively to abortion on demand, would be entirely unacceptable to the Irish people, and the possibility of it occurring should not be left open.;2625829

O'Connell (Deceased);The Labour Party;The proposed amendment follows exactly on the interpretation of the Supreme Court except in so far as threatened suicide will not be a ground for the termination of pregnancy. The decision to exclude suicide was not an easy one and was only taken by the Government after thorough and exhaustive examination of the research which was available on the relationship between suicide and pregnancy. The international literature concerning suicide and pregnancy is very complex and needs very careful and objective analysis. However, some important conclusions can be drawn. One is that suicide in pregnancy is extremely rare. Indeed, for the majority of women pregnancy seems to be good for their psychological health and may indeed protect against suicide.;2625831

O'Connell (Deceased);The Labour Party;This is exemplified in much of the literature I read during the summer. A second important finding is that the psychiatrist's task in assessing the risk of suicide is beset by serious theoretical and practical difficulties. It is when we take these two findings together that the dilemma which faced the Government comes into focus. If it is the case that suicide in pregnancy is extremely rare, but if it is very difficult to predict accurately in an individual case, accepting suicidal tendencies as a ground [2062] for a termination would be likely to lead to the certain loss of many unborn children, without any certainty that even one suicide had been averted. Without exception the experience in other countries has been that the inclusion of mental health grounds such as risk of suicide has effectively resulted in abortion being made available on demand. The Government accept that unwanted pregnancy can lead to emotional and psychological trauma and that a caring society must be able to respond to this. However, in balancing all the rights and wrongs involved in this very complex issue we should learn from the mistakes made in other countries and recognise that abortion is not the answer. The answer lies in how as a Government we take care of women with unplanned pregnancies and how as a society we respond and care for these women.;2625833

O'Connell (Deceased);The Labour Party;The exclusion of suicide as a grounds for abortion has been presented by many both inside and outside the House as a failure on the Government's part to respond to the needs of women in Ireland today. I would like to take this opportunity to say nothing could be further from the truth. A wide range of help and assistance is available for women for whom an unplanned pregnancy may result in psychological problems. I am thinking here not only of the support services provided in each health board area by multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, community psychiatric nurses and social workers but also the wide range of support and counselling services provided by voluntary agencies. If the people decide not to adopt the Twelfth Amendment, the Supreme Court interpretation of Article 40. 3.3º will stand. The Government have decided that in that case it will be necessary to introduce legislation to regulate the position, so as to minimise the possibility [2063] that the wider grounds set out in that interpretation would lead to unjustified terminations of pregnancy.;2625835

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Dr. John F. O'Connell (Deceased);The Labour Party;I am at present working on a summary of what this legislation would have to contain. I must, however, make it very clear that I would regard the introduction of such legislation, instead of the adoption of the proposed constitutional amendment, as a far less desirable outcome. For all the reasons I have outlined earlier, it is far preferable to remove threatened suicide from the grounds for legal terminations, and I urge everyone both in this House and in our society to appreciate the importance of so doing. The complexities of the issues raised in this debate have implications not only for individual Members of the House and for the general public, but also for the medical profession. It is quite clear that medical care and the provision of that care at the margins for women when life is at risk should remain at the forefront of debate. It is the medical profession who are called upon to deal with issues of life and death, with the complex legal and treatment considerations of patients under their care. It is individual doctors who will be at the forefront of the decision-making process implicit in the issues raised by the referendum on the substantive issue. It is not the referendum itself that brings this about, it is a fact of medical life. Every day, the medical profession provide expert medical and surgical care for pregnant women regardless of the medical complexities, rarity of diagnoses or the trauma that may arise in exceptional individual cases. It is necessary to reassure people generally and women in particular that that caring and expert treatment will remain fully available in our health services regardless of the outcome of the referenda. It should be stressed that such treatment and care has been the hallmark of [2064] our health services for many years. It should be clearly acknowledged that the medical profession are obviously to the fore in deciding on matters that are the essence of life or death. That reliance on the profession has been well placed as evidenced by the high national and international reputation of our obstetric and gynaecological services in particular. This faith is clearly shared by the general public and must be safeguarded at all costs during the referenda debate. This will be a major element of my contribution as Minister for Health to the debate both in this House and outside. The medical profession either as individual doctors or within their representative or professional organisations will assess the implications of the referenda, particularly those on information and especially the substantive issue. I have no doubt that the profession will look to the Medical Council to give them guidance in matters of ethical conduct and behaviour. This is as it should be as they have the statutory function to so advise. It will be the case that the current code of ethics of the council will require scrutiny in the light of the outcome of the referenda. Whether this scrutiny will result in changes is, of course, a matter for the Medical Council in the full knowledge of the legal situation which will pertain at the time. The fundamental principles will remain that a doctor must do his best to preserve life and promote the health of the sick in accordance within the existing legal framework. I am aware that there is some concern among individual members of the profession at the implications of the referenda if approved by the people and the implications in relation to the current practice of medicine. It is important that given the pivotal role of the profession in the treatment and management of cases that any concerns of the profession generally in relation to the issues raised be addressed properly and adequately. If those concerns warrant it, I am fully available to the representative organisations to tease out the issues in so far as their members are concerned and offer whatever assistance is appropriate [2065] in the best interests of the profession and of medical care. The Fourteenth Amendment provides for the freedom to obtain, or to make available, information relating to services lawfully available in another state, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law. I now propose to outline for the House the Government's proposals for legislation in this area. It is proposed to distinguish between two types of information. The first concerns information provided by, for example, a doctor or an advice agency, to a pregnant woman who seeks advice concerning her specific circumstances. It will be a requirement that, in such circumstances, information must be given in the context of non-directive counselling on the full range of alternative options available to the person concerned. 'Non-directive counselling' means setting out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision for herself. I have been told that many Irish women arriving at clinics in Britain for abortions are found to have received no counselling before leaving Ireland. Quite apart from adding to the anxiety and stress of the women concened, there is no doubt whatsoever that this results in abortions which could have been avoided. Some women who would otherwise have had abortions choose, after counselling, to continue with their pregnancies. It has been submitted to me that, following the 1988 Supreme Court decision concerning information, doctors have been unsure of their legal position regarding counselling in crisis pregnancies. The proposed legislation will not only resolve this uncertainty, but will go further in a positive way by linking the provision of abortion information in crisis pregnancies with the provision of full non-directive counselling. The second type of information distinguished in the legislation will be information of a more general nature, which is not directed at the circumstances of an individual case, for example, general factual material which may be published [2066] in books or magazines or transmitted on radio or television. Such information will only be permitted in so far as it is factual in nature and does not seek to promote abortion in preference to alternative courses of action. It will also be a requirement that the services concerned, and the content of the information, must be fully in compliance with the law of the country in which the services are provided. It is also proposed to include in the Bill a provision enabling the Minister for Health to make regulations on more detailed aspects of these controls, should they prove necessary. The legislation will completely prohibit certain methods of providing information such as billboards, wallposters or the distribution of unsolicited leaflets. I am very much aware that there is a deep abhorrence of abortion on the part of many Irish people. While there must be freedom to obtain information when it is needed, I do not think it would be considered acceptable that people would be confronted by abortion information on billboards or notices in public places, or on leaflets delivered through their doors. As in so many of the other issues in this entire debate, it is a matter of balance and the Government will strive in the detailed legislation to get the balance right. In finalising this legislation, I will, of course, take account of any relevant findings of the European Court of Human Rights in the case involving the Well Woman Centre, the decision on which is due to be issued on 29 October. In conclusion, I want to stress again that the Government's proposals represent a careful and balanced response to very complex issues. They will reinforce the constitutional protection of the right to life of the unborn, while ensuring that all necessary care is available to women suffering life-threatening medical conditions. There are those who consider the Government's approach too restrictive there are those who consider it not restrictive enough. I think that this debate will show that most of the genuine concerns expressed by those on each of [2067] these sides are in fact resolved when the Government's approach is examined carefully. I have dealt in detail with two of the three amendments. The arguments in relation to the Thirteenth Amendment. on the freedom to travel, have been spelt out by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I fully support these. I am certain that the people, when called upon to vote in the three referenda, will edorse the balance in these amendments, and I urge all Members of the House to do likewise.;2625837

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Ben Briscoe;Fianna Fáil;However, the Opposition have made it clear that that cannot be the case. I congratulate the Government on having fulfilled their commitment given at the time of the Maastricht Referendum, to hold a referendum on travel and information, and to put forward a solution on the substantive issue. The sceptics, who predicted this would not be possible or who doubted the Government's [2068] good faith, have once again been confounded. The travel and information referenda have been broadly welcomed. They also arise from the X case. Interference with the freedom to travel is not acceptable in a modern, democratic state. There is also a wide consensus that anyone in the situation that she would wish to seek an abortion abroad should at least be given all the alternative options and non-directive counselling. It would be illogical, however, if the Irish people were to be consulted about these matters and not the main issue of abortion itself. Indeed, such a strategy would run the risk of having a negative impact on the chances of success particularly of the information referendum, if the opinion of the voter was to be confined to those more restricted aspects. The principle underlining the 1983 referendum was that the people would be consulted again, if there were any question of the legalisation of abortion in this country. This question has arisen, unexpectedly, as a result of the recent Supreme Court judgment in the X case and therefore has to be addressed. It would be a denial of democracy to allow the legalisation of abortion in this country, without the Irish people being consulted again. There are those on the Opposition benches who say that dealing with this matter by way of referendum has demonstrably failed. I reject that argument. First of all, abortion as a public policy issue was bound to have arisen in some form or other in the past ten years. It has been a deeply controversial and divisive subject in America, Britain, Germany and Italy. In Belgium the King even abdicated temporarily for 24 hours, rather than sign the legislation passed in parliament. But we have to be able to grasp nettles and deal with them. This the Government have done in putting forward these proposals. Fine Gael should not be allowed to forget the key role they played in 1981 in the decision to have this issue dealt with originally by way of referendum. It was Deputy Garret FitzGerald and the then [2069] Senator Gemma Hussey who met the pro-life amendment campaign on 30 April 1981 and gave them an instant pledge without proper reflection as to whether this was the proper way to proceed. It left Fianna Fáil with little choice but to give a similar commitment a few weeks later. Unlike Fine Gael, who had the cynical attitude to election pledges that they could be forgotten or watered down once they had achieved their purpose, Fianna Fáil back in Government in 1982 proceeded conscientiously——;2625844

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Ben Briscoe;Fianna Fáil;The question of suicide was not raised by the then Attorney General or anybody else in 1982-83. The 1983 amendment was based on the excellent principle of the equal right to life of the mother and of the unborn. Few people other than those who are openly looking for a liberal abortion law, have challenged the principle. The Supreme Court judgment in the X case requires us to further clarify the principle. This the Government have done in a way that should be reassuring to mothers and pregnant women, removing any worries as to how the equal right to life principle could be interpreted in practice. The additional principle that is set out ensures that any pregnant woman who has a life-threatening condition will be given all the treatment she requires. That will be the case, whatever the condition, and whatever the recommended treatment. Obviously, the doctor has an obligation, where possible, to have a live child born, but there is no sense at all in allowing both the mother and the foetus to die for want of treatment. While medical opinion is divided, there is sufficient weight of evidence to suggest that termination may occasionally be required to save a woman's life. This cuts across the direct/indirect distinction which is not of course a medical or legal one, and which could interfere with existing medical practice and introduce confusion and uncertainty for doctors, patients and the courts. As the chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said in a letter to The Irish Times on 16 October, there is no consensus on the matter among the medical [2072] profession, and it is not a black and white area. Indeed, in that connection I note a rather striking contradiction between the position of SPUC in Britain, which supplied most of the literature for the Irish Pro-Life Movement during the Maastricht campaign, as set out in last Saturday's Irish Press, and SPUC here. SPUC in Britain frankly acknowledge: 'Of course abortion to save the mother's life was legal before the Act. We do not dispute that it should be'. It would seem that there is a serious difference of view between SPUC in Britain and the SPUC branch in Ireland as to what is a realistic position to take. There is a folklore that goes back a long way about women with cancer, for example, being told by their priests or doctors that they may not be treated and that by implication they will be left to die. Leaving people to die, when they could be saved, is not a pro-life position. It is the opposite. Fianna Fáil in their proposal are very clearly repudiating that kind of inhumanity, to the extent it may still persist. The substance of the proposal is very pro-woman and represents a significant advance in terms of clarification of the position.;2625866

If this referendum were to be defeated, we will not be holding another one with a different, tougher wording. Either the referendum is passed, or abortion will remain legal, in cases where the woman claims to be suicidal with the backing of psychiatric experts. All the international evidence suggests that that would create a dangerous loophole. Fine Gael, while supporting the referendum, are asking for legislation. I disagree. There is no case of the legislator coming between the doctor and the patient, and I detect little demand for legislation coming from the medical profession. The legislator cannot foresee or enumerate all possible medical circumstances. [2073] It is far better to leave it between the doctor and the patient in accordance with clear general principles rather than to establish a maze of regulations. There is a further point. If the Supreme Court, barring the question of suicide, in Deputy FitzGerald's words 'removed the ambiguity' in the original wording, what possible objection can we have to incorporating the key passage in the Supreme Court's judgment word for word in the Constitution? There has been criticism of the distinction drawn with regard to health. We need to be clear why it is there. It is drawn directly from the Supreme Court judgment, which parties opposite appear to approve of. If the clause is left out, we could be faced with a Y case, where the meaning of the term 'life' is extended to include the quality of life, which is a nebulous concept, which could require us to hold some time in the future yet another referendum on this subject.;2625868

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;20.10.92;M;Mr. Ben Briscoe;Fianna Fáil;I do not know if Fine Gael and Labour or most of the representative women's groups are demanding that a health risk should be sufficient ground for termination. Are they familiar with the language of the 1967 Abortion Act in England which permits termination if the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk 'or injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman greater than if the pregnancy were terminated'? That is what has led to abortion on demand. The language is very plausible, but it leads to results quite different from what may be intended. Are those who say they do not like the distinction saying that, in order to save the health of the mother, termination should be allowed? Have they any proposals as to how such a clause could be implemented, without the risk of abuse? People have objected to the exclusion of suicide, though that exclusion at least is supported by Fine Gael with the exception so far of Deputy Fennell. The reason it has been excluded is that it is obviously [2074] open to abuse. It is very difficult ever to determine conclusively another person's intentions, even if one is a trained psychiatrist. It is therefore inadvisable to legislate for it. Studies have shown this. In Minnesota between 1950 and 1965, when suicide was an allowable ground for therapeutic abortion, over 60 per cent of abortions took place. Yet figures for actual suicides were negligible and in the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin during the seventies there was not a single case of national suicide recorded. But anyone genuinely in that situation or the persons caring for them will have the option to travel, if that is the only other way out that they see, even though I am sure excellent counselling will be available. The Government have taken into consideration the views of the Church of Ireland. Fianna Fáil have ensured both in 1983 and today that no sectarian languange is put in the Constitution. The substance of the Government's proposal is very close to the Church of Ireland's own criteria of 'strict and undeniable medical necessity' as the only justification of a termination. While respecting their preference for legislation, I feel that would not be the proper democratic response. I believe the general principle can work, and that it is actually better than legislation, because it leaves the responsibility with the medical profession, who I believe will have no serious difficulty working with the wording, as the President of the IMO has confirmed. As legislators we have a wider responsibility to society as a whole. Our personal convictions, while important, cannot be our sole guide to sensitive and controversial social issues. I believe the churches will respect, as they have often proclaimed in the past, the different role that they have in setting out their moral teaching, and our role as legislators, which must have regard to what is workable, practicable, and above all defensible in terms of public policy. As a country we are faced with many pressing economic and other problems. I see no case for delaying and prolonging the debate. The vast majority of the Irish [2075] people want a proposition to be put to them and to decide on it, so that we can all move on to other business as quickly as possible. It is certainly not the Government that want to prolong any unavoidable diversion of public attention. They have had the courage to take up a clear position on this most difficult of issues.;2625870

One of the opinions which I have heard now — the gospel according to Deputy Briscoe — is that once people have spoken on this debate they should have no furthere act or part in it. I resent that and also the implication that because Deputy Briscoe has chosen to complete his speech at midnight on Tuesday 20 October that should be the end of the debate. I would say to Deputy Briscoe that I was one of the legislators in 1983, and contrary to what the Deputy has now put on the record in 1992 — that in some way Fianna Fáil were innocent or had washed their hands of this problem — the facts are, and this was put on the record tonight by Deputy FitzGerald, that when the Government, on the advice of the Attorney General and in complete agreement with the Labour Party members of Cabinet, decided that the wording created a risk to the life of women, we proposed an alternative wording which Fianna Fáil rejected on the basis that they were not the words their party wanted. Indeed, some of the Members who are now Ministers said that the reason these words were being used by Fianna Fáil was that they were ambiguous. That is what Fianna Fáil wanted in 1983 we tried to stop them in Seanad Éireann but they outvoted us and accused us during that campaign and on other occasions up to and including the last Presidential campaign of being in some way soft on abortion. I resent that as a Christian and indeed as a Catholic. Debate adjourned.;2625871

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Michael Ferris;The Labour Party;At midnight last night certain views were expressed by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, in particular, on this subject and during the debate they almost tried to wash their hands of the [20] situation which arose in 1981 and 1983. I should like to put the record straight. In 1983 the Parliamentary Labour Party, in the Seanad in particular, were totally opposed to the taking of that Bill on Second Stage because, as we pointed out with considerable force having regard to the legal advice available to us at that time, the words presented by Fianna Fáil and supported by the Pro-Life Movement could lead us into dangerous situations which would put people's lives at risk. It does not give me any satisfaction — or the Labour Party any kudos — to say that our worst fears in 1983 were confirmed and that the words that were used or, more specifically, the legal interpretation of the words used have led to where we are today in regard to this matter. Are we about to make the same mistake again and if we are, will we compound the original mistake? By the insertion of these words in the Constitution will we do a disservice to the lives, welfare, health and protection of more than 50 per cent of our population, whether they are our wives or our daughters? Should we be asked by any Government to accept words which would give women a lesser right to life than anybody else? That brings us back to the question of leadership, trust, consensus or whatever. The Labour Party tried to achieve a consensus in this regard and, as has been said, it is doubtful whether the Government side ever wanted to reach a consensus. They obviously had their minds made up as was the case when they were in Opposition in 1983. Because the electorate trusted the Fianna Fáil Party and the Pro-Life Movement in 1983 they voted overwhelmingly for what they believed to be correct, to protect the life of the unborn and the mother and the Constitution was amended giving both the child and the mother equal rights in a pregnancy where a choice might have to be made. Unfortunately, when a case arose where that choice had to be made, namely the X case, we discovered the implications of that decision. From discussions I have had with people in my constituency, I am satisfied that the majority of people in giving that view in [21] 1983 believed that what they were doing was giving a positive right to the unborn child and an equal right to the life of the mother. To date, I have not seen any evidence to suggest that the people have changed their minds in regard to that decision. The majority of people whom I know want to protect the life of the unborn and the lives of women and girls at risk during pregnancy. We, in the Labour Party, share those objectives which is why our leader said yesterday that he is the pro-life leader of a pro-life party which is the oldest pro-life party in the country. At the same time, we believe that few people in Ireland would want to place a restriction on the freedom of any of those people to travel. During the debate on the Maastricht Treaty Deputy O'Kennedy, who is a barrister, said there was no restriction on people in regard to travel and members of the Government also said this. Some judges of the Supreme Court said that there was a restriction on travel and patiently explained why and under what circumstances. It is extraordinary that Mr. Binchy informed us that he sees no problem in regard to the right of women to travel. We do not need that kind of assurance from a self-appointed spokesperson such as Mr. Binchy or, for that matter, from any group. However, a question was raised in regard to the right to travel in certain circumstances and, therefore, it was patently misleading for people, such as Deputy O'Kennedy and others, to suggest that there was any confusion in this area. It is for that reason there are three Bills before the House today, in regard to the right to travel, the right to information — on which, at last, people have reached agreement — and the right to abortion. We must ask ourselves if we are doing a disservice to the people again, because we have shown a lack of leadership or, indeed, courage in being unable to get the Government to agree to address any of these problems by way of legislation by which they could have been dealt with by way of intrinsic amendments in this House, but the Government ran away from this problem. The X case was [22] brought to the Supreme Court and the Government castigated that court and its members for their decisions. The Minister for Justice has now assured everybody that there is no problem in this regard and that in the Government's view a consensus has been reached. They say that all the people, including the pro-life people, were wrong, apart from the Minister for Justice. Last night the Minister for Health assured us that he would lay down regulations and guidelines for the medical profession who have already stated that they are divided on this issue. How can we lay down regulations for professional people who will be confronted in the future with making a decision that is supposed to combine its movements within the constrictions in the Constitution, defend the right to life of the mother and the unborn, with all the pious platitudes and aspirations that one expects in a Constitution? It is a very dangerous way to deal with this matter. It comes back to trust: can anybody trust any medical or legal view of any side of this House when from experience in this very difficult area we know this issue could eventually be returned to the Supreme Court for their interpretation of what we now accept, or do not accept, will be inserted into our Constitution? Can anyone trust the Government on their record on these issues when we remember that during the Supreme Court case — which they suggested would be taken and for which they agreed to cover the costs — a barrister representing them in the Supreme Court said that if an English woman came to Ireland, learned she was pregnant and wished to return to England to avail of what is a legal service there, and if he learned of her pregnancy he would have no choice but to prevent her returning to England? How can we trust a Government who have decided, without consultation, to insert a Protocol into the Maastricht Treaty? Can we trust them when they told us that this Protocol would be legally binding but then sought a derogation on the Protocol? Having discussed the matter with their colleagues in Europe we were given another assurance that it [23] would have legal binding when the legal opinion from Europe at the time was that it would not. How did the Minister, Deputy Flynn, deal with the Protocol in his speech yesterday? He said: The Protocol relates to Article 40. 3.3 as it stood on 7 February 1992 when the Treaty was signed. On the face of things Article 40. 3.3 as interpreted by the Supreme Court should retain the protection of the Protocol when the Treaty comes into effect and this would mean that abortion could not in any event be legalised beyond the extent permitted by the Supreme Court. The Solemn Declaration on the Protocol to the Treaty, adopted by the member states on 1 May 1992... One can question with hindsight whether that Solemn Declaration means anything. It provides that— ... in the event of a constitutional amendment of Article 40. 3.3 the contracting parties to the Treaty will, following the entry into force of the Treaty, be favourably disposed to amending the Protocol so as to extend its application to any such constitutional amendment. If the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution is passed the question of invoking the procedure set out in the Solemn Declaration with a view to securing an amendment of the Protocol will be taken up. If the Government do take it up, can we trust them or will we be left again with two constitutional amendments, one of which has already been interpreted by the Supreme Court and the other which we are trying to ensure they cannot reinterpret? We then have to link that with our colleagues in Europe, the contracting parties to a Solemn Declaration. All we can say to the Irish people today is that it will be taken up. Our party leader was correct yesterday when he stated that for the first time this Bill will incorporate into our Constitution the principle of legal abortion. Our task is to reassure the Irish people [24] that they can trust the legislators. When it comes to this subject they have stated that they cannot trust them. I have met various groups and I had letters from people, such as Sister Brid McKenna, a person for whom I have the greatest respect, and with whom I could not disagree about anything she stated in her letter. I have also met people representing the pro-life movement in my constituency and I did not notice any sign of intransigence in their views. They were concerned that the opinion they had expressed in 1983 had been proven to be incorrect. I suggested that they come up with alternative wording if they were so concerned about the matter. These people were reasonable and we had a consensus in that all of us felt we had a duty to perform. However, when the pro-life movement suggested an alternative wording to the Government recently, the Government rubbished it. Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Flynn, rubbished the idea of any wording that the pro-life movement put to him. He gave us legal views as to why they were not acceptable. Indeed, the Minister has treated suggestions from all the political parties with disregard. In other words, he is right, and what he says is right. As President Bush would say, 'read my lips' it is like a papal dogma he does not make mistakes. This was the line followed by Deputy Briscoe last night. Now that the Minister, Deputy Flynn, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, and Deputy Briscoe have spoken there is no need to continue this debate. That is a very intransigent attitude to adopt when people are concerned about this issue and it will not be resolved with the wording that has been presented by the Government. That will lead to further difficulties and make more difficult the task that lies ahead. Apart from suggesting amendments to the Government this week, our task is to protect the rights espoused by all Deputies and that will involve much debate, argument, compromise, analysis and, finally, a decision which we should not simply dump on the electorate by saying it is the only option. The reality is [25] that in this case they have no options. They have the opportunity to vote Yes or No on two items that are not contentious, but then they must vote on an issue which gives them no option, an issue they felt they had decided in 1983. There are fundamental differences in our approach to these matters and I am concerned that this will lead to further divisiveness. It will lead to a national debate that no Member will understand because it will be so emotive. If the pro-life movement takes on the Government — it is quite obvious that the Progressive Democrats are unhappy — it will be an amazing turn of events that two groups, who were originally merged, will come apart because the Government are providing for legalised abortion in the Constitution. Those are the options the Irish electorate have. The electorate accepted the advice given them in 1983, foolishly in our opinion. That will pale into insignificance when they consider the confusion that will arise on the legal interpretation of the wording. There are members in my party who are more capable of interpreting these words. I am concerned, having listened to the medical and legal advice available, that the words proposed by the Government do not address the question. In my opinion it will be necessary, irrespective of whether this legislation is passed, to introduce some legislative measure to address the two aspects of these constitutional amendments, the question of information and of the right to life of the unborn and the superior right to life of the mother when her life is at risk. They are two important areas and the Government have not satisfied me that they know or care what they are doing in this regard. I hope that when this debate ends people will be clearer in their minds as to the options before them which are being put forward in haste, without proper debate or any effort to reach consensus.;2626331

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;I should like to deal very quickly with the phrase that has caused such anger and anguish as distinct from the health issue. The speech of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, is littered with inconsistencies and non sequiturs. He tries to make the argument — and again he thinks he is taking the middle ground — to those who say that the words 'as distinct from health' should be omitted, that somehow by removing those words, open abortion would be allowed totally on health grounds. I do not know how he can say that. It is clear from reading the amendment, with the exception of those words, that only in the case of substantial risk to the mother's life would termination be available. I should like to quote from the speech of the Minister for Justice as follows: [55] The suggestion that the words 'as distinct from the health' should be omitted from the proposed amendment really boils down to this — that it should be possible to terminate the life of an unborn child where there is no risk to the life of the mother. I still have not managed, even after a night's sleep, to understand how he arrived at that interpretation. It is clear from the discussions I and other Fine Gael colleagues have had with both the medical and the legal professions that those words, at the very least, are superfluous and supernumerary and are unnecessary in this amendment. No matter what any Minister may say I believe these words were put in as a sop, as a way of saying to people that the decisions doctors will make will be made only on the issue of life. Doctors will say that is what they are making their decisions on, that they are making their decisions on the span of a woman's life, that they do not stand over her bed saying — though they may have to do so if this legislation is passed —'this woman has breast cancer, she has undergone a mastectomy', while another doctor might say: 'she must have chemotherapy but there is a risk to the baby', and yet another doctor might say: 'we have saved her life by performing the operation and she does not need the chemotherapy until after the baby is safely born'. But within two or three years' time, the woman may get the cancer back again, and die. The problem is that maternal statistics cease a short time after the baby is born and therefore, will not indicate if, three or five years down the road, the mother may be dead because of not having been given the treatment, during her pregnancy, that could have saved her life. These are the real issues at stake in this debate. Finally, I should like to refer to the information issue as referred to by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, last night. In his contribution he began to give us some idea as to what would be involved in the matter of information but that is as far as he went. We are still in [56] the dark. His words appear to differ from those of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn. We need to know who will provide the advice and what resources will be made available. We have only to look at the Rape Crisis Centre to see how little money the Government give them and how they have to fight for it each year. What arrangements will be made for pregnant suicidal girls who need urgent and immediate attention? A number of issues are still unclear in regard to the legislation and the sooner the Minister puts it before the House the better.;2626335

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Ruairí Quinn;The Labour Party;As a man I feel somewhat inhibited talking about these matters, [26] particularly the substantive issue, because no man can fully appreciate or understand the emotions and feelings that women experience in the process of conceiving and bearing a child, or perhaps losing a child. It is with that caveat, of which I am painfully conscious, that I contribute to this debate. The history of this sad and sordid constitutional mess is rooted in something which I find to be offensive, fundamentally anti-democratic and anti-republican. The claim made by some people is that politicians are not to be trusted and therefore into our Constitution had to be written a provision for the protection of the life of the unborn, so that no group of elected politicians could at some future stage remove that protection. A group of highly motivated, well financed and fanatical fundamentalists unfortunately persuaded the then Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Haughey, and the then Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Fitzgerald, to give a commitment in 1982 to insert in our Constitution the amendment which has brought us to the point where we are today. That is where it started. It is to his eternal credit that the late Frank Cluskey in his inimitable fashion told those people where to get off. It is a tribute to the courage of the present Leader of the Labour Party that within a week of taking on that responsibility in November 1982 he said that he would not give such a commitment to these fundamentalists because of the constitutional implications which could arise from the proposed wording. The rest is history, but history has a tragic way of repeating itself. I cannot use the Marxist phrase, 'once in tragedy, second in farce' because this is no farcical matter. It is an extraordinary matter which is of concern to everybody. The Fianna Fáil Party unashamedly exploited the decency and religious belief of large numbers of the population in 1983. They mobilised those sincere people, telling them there was a way to amend the Constitution which would not have complications. In 1983 the people in Dublin South-East, my constituency, who silently manned the polling stations [27] were in many cases Fianna Fáil activists wearing pro-life labels and taking pleasure in what they saw as the political discomfort of the Government of the day. There was total disregard for the sincerity and beliefs of the people whose hearts and minds they had mobilised and total disregard for the political damage they were inflicting on the fabric of this republic by putting into the Constitution a nonsensical wording which would ultimately be found to be contradictory by the Supreme Court. Today Fianna Fáil can run but they can no longer hide. They have to say that they are legislating for abortion. I wish to refer to two parts of yesterday's speech by the Minister for Justice. I am not purporting to include the Progressive Democrats in this farce. The Minister said: Under the amendment, where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is endangered if the pregnancy continues, the pregnancy may be lawfully terminated if that is necessary to save her life. For lawfully terminated, use the more colloquial phrase, the pregnancy may be legally aborted. The Minister continued: There is no warrant whatsoever for any suggestion that the amendment will open the door to abortion. It is most emphatically not an abortion amendment. Far from making the law concerning abortion more permissive, as some people are wrongly suggesting, the amendment will have exactly the opposite affect: it will prohibit abortion in circumstances where it is now permitted without disturbing existing medical practice and without putting mothers' lives at risk.;2626338

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Ruairí Quinn;The Labour Party;When is an abortion not an abortion? This is the nub of the question. [28] This Fianna Fáil pro-life Government are putting forward legislation to give legal effect to abortion. They have insulted, misled and betrayed a constituency, in many cases a sincere and well meaning constituency, who trusted them. I hope that lesson of betrayal will be learned by that constituency at the appropriate time. We have three Bills before us relating to three proposals which will be put to the people on 3 December. Citizens are being asked to vote for the right to travel. In 1992, after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the dictatorship in Argentina, the collapse of totalitarianism in countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain and after the amelioration of the fundamentalist Islamic Republic's stance in relation to women's rights in Iran, in this Republic of Ireland citizens are being asked to affirm by way of an amendment to the Constitution, because of an interpretation by the Supreme Court of the 1983 amendment, the right to travel. As a citizen, I find that absolutely insulting and if I was a woman I would feel degraded by being asked to vote to affirm that right. Nevertheless I will vote and will recommend that people generally do so. The right should never have been questioned in the first place. The second point is the right to information. What kind of country is this republic when we have to affirm the right to information about services which are legally available? When did the Inquisition end? When did the Cold War end? When did 'darkness at noon' end? What is the mentality of a political party who can bring themselves in 1992, eight years from the end of a second millenium and 70 years after this State was created by people who had the courage to put words on paper honestly and openly, to ask us to do this sort of thing? They claim it is necessary because of the Supreme Court judgment, a judgment which they repeatedly asserted in 1983 could not possibly be made. Now we have to vote for the right to information about services legally available. I publicly applaud the students who led the charge in this matter. I hope as a consequence of this right being formally [29] put back into the Constitution that the oppressive witch hunt that SPUC have mounted against those students, both collectively and individually, will cease. That witch hunt had the effect that many of those students who were cited and charged in various judgments still have hanging over their heads the threat of legal costs resulting from previous actions, which would have the effect of bankrupting any one of those students. As has been said by an eminent lawyer they have been effectively exiled from this country by virtue of the SPUC threat to pursue them in the manner in which they have been pursued. No doubt, Deputy Taylor will be better able to refer to that, if he chooses. With regard to the substantive issue, we have here a proposal to introduce abortion under our Constitution, but a commitment not to provide legislation to interpret how it can be administered by doctors, nurses and hospitals or understood by lawyers and everybody else. I do not know of any other provision in our Constitution about which the Government say, 'we will put this in', while giving an undertaking in advance that under no circumstances will they produce legislation to enable us to understand or interpret it. It is like demanding that a pilot be sent up into the air without a flight plan, instructions, maps or navigational equipment. What a risky way to embark on any kind of civil action. Ultimately this will again end up in the Supreme Court and we will have a Y case. Hard cases make bad law, yet we are being asked to use the wording from the X case judgment which refers to saving the life as distinct from the health of the woman. The Minister justifies the reason for using that sacrosanct phraseology by saying it is because it came from one of the Supreme Court judgments. It is certainly a very eminent judgment but it should not be sacrosanct. We are not locked into it. We should do what the late lamented Supreme Court Judge Mr. Justice McCarthy, asked us to do, take democratic courage in our hands and do [30] the job we were charged with, which is to legislate. If we are to legislate for abortion, as we are being asked to do and as the Minister's text has clearly indicated, I do not want to save the life, as distinct from the health of any woman. I want to protect the lives of all women and their health by implication. I do not want to make a distinction and I will live with whatever way history interprets the meaning of the life of the woman and what threatens the life of any woman. Every woman should have the right to respond as she wishes if she becomes pregnant as a result of rape or incest. They should have that choice in this Republic and not have to scurry away in the middle of the night like criminals, carrying the hurt of the criminal act without having the right to have it redressed in this Republic. The leader of the Progressive Democrats came into this Chamber and ended his speech by referring to his declaration that he will stand by the Republic. Where is his stance now? Where are the Progressive Democrats now when the Republic is being undermined by this kind of legislation that will drive citizens of this State to another jurisdiction which is much maligned in the pantheon of rhetoric from the Fianna Fáil Party, to find redress for crimes committed here, when they should, as citizens, have the right to redress here. This is the offensive nonsense we are being asked to write into our Constitution. I reject it utterly. In the short time available to me I want to concentrate on one aspect of the referendum that will be put to the people. It is particularly odious and unacceptable that we are being asked to approve a measure that deliberately sets out to roll back the Supreme Court judgment in the X case in respect of the threat of suicide. What this provision means is that we do not trust the Supreme Court. Last night in this House, Deputy Briscoe dismissed the Supreme Court judgment as highly controversial and said that its validity had been disputed by many eminent lawyers without, of course, managing to name any of them. [31] It follows from our Constitution that judgments of the Supreme Court cannot be invalid. One may disagree with them but they are the ultimate tribunal of assessment and interpretation of our law. In the X case the Supreme Court, to their eternal credit, got this country off a hook on which it was firmly dangling. If the Supreme Court had held otherwise what would have been the outcome assuming the unfortunate girl had carried out her threat which eminent psychiatrists had determined was a real one? That is what we have to face in this referendum so far as the issue of suicide is concerned. There is and must be a very real risk that in some cases some unfortunate girl or woman will be considered by psychiatrists to be likely to carry out a threat of suicide, and will do it. The Minister for Justice in his speech yesterday referring to the context of danger of life from an ongoing pregnancy said: If there were to be only one case in one million, or even ten or more million, we would have to take account of it. There is a duty on all of us to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken. If the risk to a girl or woman from suicide is only one in a million, why then do the Minister and the Government take it upon themselves to specifically exclude that case in the wording for this referendum? The Minister says that there is considerable room for a subjective judgment in assessing whether a risk of suicide exists. Maybe there is a subjective element in it but nonetheless we have here skilled and experienced psychiatrists who know their job and we should pay attention to and respect what they say although they may say that the risk may not arise in many cases. If it arises in only one case how would any of us in this House feel if we adopt this referendum and exclude the provision for a termination [32] in the case of a threat of suicide? If the person is unable for financial and other considerations to avail of the safety net being allowed, to go to the UK to have the termination and goes ahead and commits suicide, thereby destroying herself and the foetus, how would any of us feel about carrying that on our consciences for the rest of our days in the knowledge that we contributed to it? That is one major responsibility for any Deputy to take upon himself and it is quite outrageous that the Government are prepared to put such a suggestion before us today. Deputy Briscoe's contribution yesterday was a milder version of the whispering campaign that is being conducted by elements of the so-called pro-life movement and by members of the Fianna Fáil ever since the Supreme Court judgment was issued. That campaign has been conducted against the Supreme Court, against the girl at the centre of the X case and against her family. It has been a degrading and debasing exercise. It says far more about the people conducting it than it does about their targets. Much worse, the amendment we are being asked to pass into law in the form of a constitutional amendment is asking us to state that we do not trust women. The inference to be drawn from the whole approach taken by the Government is that if we give women any grounds for seeking abortion they will be queueing up to avail of the service. What a comment that is on the men who have put this law together. Last night on RTE television a family that had been systematically abused by their father told in simple and moving terms of the trauma and suffering they had endured at the hands of a sexual abuser. It was a good illustration, if one were needed, of the prevalence of pain, mental disturbance and guilt that a sexual abuser can inflict, and it was an illustration in microcosm of a serious social problem that has been a hidden part of our society for many years. Some years ago we had another illustration of a different aspect of the same [33] problem when the tragic story of Anne Lovett was carried in full detail in all our media. I can remember well meaning people all over the country saying that we must not let this kind of thing happen again. We do not know how Anne Lovett became pregnant. All we know is that the shame of her pregnancy killed her. We do not, in the nature of things, know how many victims of sexual abuse become pregnant. All we know is that those who do suffer the kind of mental torment that most of us never have to experience. Much reference has been made in this State to the study published last week by Dr. Anthony Clare. One aspect of that study which has not been adverted to was the finding that in general terms the risk of suicide among pregnant women is lower than among the population in general, but it exists and is real nonetheless. Several reasons have been adduced by professional psychiatrists for this. First, for the great majority of families and mothers pregnancy is a happy and fulfilling event, often a long sought event. Second, there is an innate sense of responsibility and compassion that characterises women and that enables them to face motherhood in a positive spirit. Third, pregnancy is a time when families provide a high degree of support. The study also showed that there are occasions when these ingredients might not be present, particularly in societies which have a repressive attitude and history in relation to sexual issues. The victim of rape or incest can also find herself the victim of intolerance, deprived of love and support when she needs it most, outcast from the society to which she belongs, and that is when she is most vulnerable. Yesterday the head of a supposedly caring organisation called Women Hurt by Abortion addressed the annual general meeting of another supposedly caring organisation called Family Solidarity. He was not able to find the time in his address to refer to the victims of rape and incest. Instead he referred to women who had secured abortions and said that they had been reduced to the [34] status of garbage which produces garbage. This was the 'caring' description of this caring organisation of the women they claim to care about. Yesterday, too, the Church of Ireland Gazette published what I would describe as a truly caring response. I believe it is worthwhile quoting what they had to say for the record of this House: Ministers must make up their minds — whether to bow to blackmail and organised pressure, or to decide that in a modern, adult society, the only honourable course is to allow people to make up their minds about the things that vitally affect their own lives — after legislation is in place to ensure order, reflection and protection for others who may be involved. It is long past the time when we must cut through the hypocrisy that surrounds this issue in Ireland. There can be no more odious form of hypocrisy than a set of laws underpinned by a constitutional framework that says to the women of Ireland 'you can have an abortion in Ireland provided you are at death's door for the want of it, and provided that you can find a doctor who will agree that you are ill enough and can reconcile the operation with his own conscience otherwise you are free to leave and have the abortion in England — and, by the way, here is a set of brochures to facilitate you in finding a clinic somewhere else.' I find it hard to imagine a more hypocritical formula then this, and I find it hard to believe that any Government who believe in the democratic will of the people would seriously be foisting this amendment on them. There is a famous legal textbook called Constitutions of the World. I searched for such a formula in it, looking for a parallel somewhere else, anywhere else for this proposition, but there is none. What this means is that we are about to become the first country in the world that, on the one hand, will write into our Constitution an explicit provision that will provide directly for legal abortion and, on the other, make a set of arrangements that will ensure that no woman will ever be [35] able to avail of that provision. Why are we doing it? Surely the only answer is that we have to make these kinds of arrangements because women cannot be trusted, and what on earth gives us the right to say that? On what basis are we making the outrageous assumption that women in Ireland are going to abuse the law to terminate pregancies on some sort of whim? In a sense this debate has come full circle. It started because a small, intolerant and professional organised pressure group decided that they did not trust the legislators. Then they decided they did not trust the courts and now they have decided they do not trust women. If I am ill and go to hospital, I am not going to stand for any doctor saying to me that I am not yet sick enough to warrant treatment. I do not know a doctor who would say it in the first place, and I am certainly not going to tolerate a doctor taking down his copy of the Constitution and telling me that according to his interpretation of the Constitution I can have one form of treatment that will probably shorten my life but that he cannot give me the treatment to protect my life. I will campaign in any way I can to defeat this amendment. If I needed an incentive to do so it is contained in what the Government obviously see as their threat to legislate on the issue if the amendment is defeated. The defeat of this amendment would restore this whole issue to the place where it has always belonged, the Floor of this House.;2626340

I join Deputy Owens in asking the Minister for Health to return to this Chamber and give us open information and funding for [62] support services which will be necessary if we are to take a moral high stand and exclude women from the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Do we support lone parents or unmarried mothers with regard to housing and adequate allowances for themselves and their children? Where is the recognition and the financial reward for a family who take in the child of one of their children? Lone parents — usually women — are denied access to adult education, to training and the VTOS scheme, and we value life, the unborn and woman who, through all those incredible disadvantages and difficulties, bring babies into this world. Finally, why do we trust our women so little? Why do we trust the moral fibre of our society so little? When will individual members in our society be allowed to judge for themselves, to refer to their own consciences and have open access to information and counselling to allow them to do that? During this debate there must be some acknowledgement of the sacrifices, unstinting generosity, life-long commitment and input of women to their families and children, particularly the mothering role of Irish women which has even ended up as a joke about the 'Irish mammy'. The Government should heed our views and those of people both inside and outside this House and have somne conscience about putting a confused and dangerous wording to the people again. Not alone is it undemocratic, it is an an offence against women.;2626343

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Desmond J. O'Malley;Fianna Fáil;Two weeks ago, at the outset of the current phase of the debate on how to deal with the complex, emotive and deeply divisive matter of the correct balance to be struck between the rights of pregnant women and the unborn, I [63] made a plea that the issue be pursued on a political consensus basis. Furthermore, I made clear my own preference, and that of the Progressive Democrats, that the fundamental issues arising in relation to this matter be dealt with by legislation rather than by a further constitutional amendment. I did this because of the sheer complexities of the issues involved, and also because I believe that most people do not want to have to make such a sensitive and complicated decision in this way. Finally, I made this appeal in the context of the deep national, social and economic problems facing the country. Most notably, there is the underlying unemployment crisis the exacerbation of this problem by the sudden international monetary crisis and the devaluation of sterling the attendant pressure on family budgets arising in particular from the serious jump in mortgage interest rates and, last, but not least, the delicate situation reached in the Northern Ireland talks against a background of continuing violence. Without minimising in any way the importance of the issues that arise when considering abortion, I sincerely believe that the great majority of the Irish people want to see their politicians and their Government get on with tackling, unimpeded, those problems I have just listed. Members of the Oireachtas should not be afraid to legislate in a difficult area like abortion, because it is simply impossible to reduce the matter in all its complexities down to a single black or white proposition to put to the people for inclusion in the Constitution on a yes or no basis. I deeply regret, therefore, that it has not been possible to maintain the politicial consensus which did exist at the time of the Maastricht referendum and which extended to the less contentious aspects of the matters now before this House. Namely, the need to restore by way of referendum an unequivocal right to travel and the right also to obtain here in Ireland non-directive and supportive counselling and information concerning services that are legal in other countries. [64] Turning to the so-called substantive issue, I have to say that it is anything but black and white. One has only to take into acount the exchanges already arising in the current debate, and the evidence of many medical practitioners, to realise that various medical problems can arise — and do arise — for a small minority of pregnant women which are not only deeply upsetting and traumatic in their own right, because of the threats they pose to the health and lives of the women concerned, but also because of the heartrending implications they can have for the unborn child which those women are carrying. I strongly believe that in these exceptional cases, which can derive from various medical conditions associated with cancer, blood diseases or heart problems, or which could be of the outcome of a serious accident, the decision facing such pregnant women and the implications for their unborn, are matters which should be resolved by the unfortunate women affected, with their immediate and closest family members, and their medical consultants. The traumatic personal decisions and choices when they have to make, should not be made in the context of any country's constitution. I believe too that medical experts have a daunting task in deciding in all conscience and good faith what is the best course of action to take when they are directed principally by a general constitutional statement that is hard to interpret in particular circumstances. That is why I have urged that these are matters best dealt with by legislation. It is simply impossible to reduce the complexities of the matters before us to a single black and white proposition to be enshrined as a basic principle of constitutional law in this State. On the contrary, we hear, day after day, further cogent argument and examples which demonstrate clearly that this issue should be tackled by way of legislation, thereby allowing some degree of guidance and compassion which cannot be achieved in a single constitutional statement. There is much in the debate of the last [65] few weeks which is deeply offensive and insulting not only to women who have faced, or might face, traumatic choices relating to their life and health when pregnant, but which has also been very offensive and unfeeling to women in general. In this context I was touched by the comments last week of the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women, Ms Frances Fitzgerald, when she said that women were angry listening to lingustic contortions on the question of abortion in a debate that frequently did not respect women's own judgment. Earlier this year, this nation displayed a very real sense of compassion and concern when the High Court granted an injunction to the Attorney General preventing a 14 year old girl, who had been raped and was pregnant, travelling to England to have her pregnancy terminated. That concern stemmed in part from the unacceptable consequences of the 1983 constitutional amendment, which resulted in a legal intrusion into the private and painful trauma of the child and her family in those most awful of circumstances. The High Court decision was based on an interpretation quite different from the solemn assurances given us in 1983 by the proponents of the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court in this instance managed to extricate us as a people from this dreadful situation by deciding that the danger of suicide by this girl was such as to pose a real and substantial threat to her life and, because of this, the court decided to lift the injunction against her. It is of particular relevance that while the Attorney General took the action the State funded the appeal to the Supreme Court by the girl. This surely demonstrates the very difficult position that arises when exceptional cases happen which do not fit a particular formulation contained in the Constitution. We should ask ourselves whether our real concern and our subsequent relief about this girl was related to whether she would commit suicide, or was it an acknowledgment that we as a society were uncomfortable with forcing this girl to [66] go through a full-term pregnancy in the particular circumstances of that case, especially given the fact that she was only 14 and her plight stemmed from being raped? Clearly, while the vast majority of the Irish people strongly believe that abortion should be illegal, they were willing to entertain an exception in the X case. This was, of course, especially true when it was due to happen in England. However, other types of cases have also been highlighted in the current debate where the mother's health or life can be severely threatened, and where medical intervention necessitates either a direct or indirect termination. Each such case tears at our conscience and forces us into examining the issue in a manner which is no longer black and white, but obliges us to consider the overall balance of rights in each such case. In the 1983 40. 3.3º Amendment the people were attempting to strike a balance between the rights of the mother and the unborn. This balance in turn has to be considered in conjunction with Articles 40. 3.1º and 40. 3.2º which impose an obligation on the State to vindicate the life and personal rights of its citizens, including, of course, pregnant women. In the X case the Supreme Court adjudicated on this balance of rights. They decided that where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, she had a right to have an abortion. They did not confer the right to an abortion on any other basis. They did not grant the right to an abortion in cases of rape or incest. They did not grant the right to an abortion where the mother was a minor. They restricted the right to an abortion to cases where, on the evidence, there was a real and substantial risk to her life. There are plenty of lessons to be learned from the X case. One is that the only interpretation of words in the Constitution that counts is the view formed by the Supreme Court. Ministers, Deputies, doctors, clerics and lawyers can in all good faith give their view of what certain words mean, but their interpretation [67] has no standing whatever. Words can be interpreted in an unexpected way. If they are, if a mistake is made it can be conveniently corrected if it is in legislation. It is extremely difficult to correct if it is in the Constitution.;2626346

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;I pay tribute to the men who do. I am sure my colleague, Deputy Higgins, will agree with me that the reason we are having a debate on this overwhelming and oppressive kind of constitutional amendment, is because we do not have a fair representation as between men and women Members. Before focusing on the legislation before us I should like to put a few matters in context, one of which is the history of abortion. I wish to ask again a question to which no satisfactory answer has yet been given. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, has assured us that a referendum on divorce will receive adequate discussion and debate. Despite the fact that legislation was put in place after the referendum on divorce, that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown produced a very full report and that there are models in other countries which have worked, we have been assured by the Minister for Justice that he could not, in conscience, put a referendum on divorce to the people until all the legislation is in place, even if that took two years, which I am sure it will. Am I to take it that it is [57] not seen fit in the case of this referendum, which will have a fundamental effect on the life and health of women and which arises as a result of the earlier botched referendum to put all the legislation in place before it is put to the people? What does this say about the attitude of the Minister and the Government to women? They believe that this issue can be rushed through. I am sure my colleagues will agree with me that the ironical offer made by our caring and family-centred Taoiseach this morning, when we protested yet again at the lack of time being made available for this debate, that we could sit on Saturday and Sunday, showed a lack of insight and sensitivity to women and men and the protection of life and family values, which the debate is all about. Politicians and everyone who is privileged to be in employment look forward to spending Saturday and Sunday with their families. It is a matter of regret to my colleagues and to me that the reform of this Dáil is so slow that this House sits the most anti-family hours ever. We were told we could sit on Saturday and Sunday, the time we spend with our families, to discuss this important family-centred issue. The Taoiseach should be indicted for making that derisory offer. It is an indication of the insight he has into family values and the kind of support needed for women in the home. At least during this debate we are able to say the word 'abortion' out loud. If we mentioned the word 'abortion' during the 1983 debate — I am sure my colleagues will remember this — we were threatened physically and immediately labelled as abortionists. The debate on the complex issue of abortion in Ireland did not start yesterday. The history of abortion and the attempts to deal with it prove the complexity of this area and highlight the desperation experienced by women about the way they have been treated in regard to this issue. All civilisations and cultures record that women, driven to distraction, have sought abortions or have attempted abortions on themselves, very often with horrifying results. Indeed great numbers [58] of women have died both from childbirth and attempted abortions. Either way, this has been a high risk and painful process for countless generations of women. Even though it was risky, dangerous and life-threatening, women still had babies. The greatest insult to women is that in some way men have to control our murderous intent towards our unborn. The legalising of abortion in restricted circumstances has led to a dramatic decrease in the number of women who have died or suffered as a result of this process. The present debate is not a conspiracy by fanatical feminists, the World Health Organisation and the International Family Planning Association. Indeed in some countries where contraception and family planning clinics are not allowed there are still horrifying stories about very young women who, because of tribal or community pressure, are mutilated or who mutilate themselves in attempting to get rid of unwanted pregnancies. Some of these young women die and many of those who live are rendered infertile, suffer life-time health problems and have to endure social stigma. I do not think the background to this issue has been taken into consideration by the Government, who have decided blithely to remove the sentence which referred to self-destruction. This shows how little they know about the desperation felt by some women. Despite the complexity of this issue, the lack of support services for women, the fact that women have the main responsibility for child rearing and the painful experience of the 1983 referendum and its outcome, the Government still insists on repeating the same mistakes and proposing amendments which will end up in both Irish and European courts. There is not much we can be sure of during this debate but we can be sure of that. Intrusion into the professional relationship between doctors and their women patients will be but one of the effects of this ill-sponsored and rushed referendum. It is shameful that the referenda on the right to travel and the right to information have to be put to the electorate [59] in order to restore to citizens two of their most basic freedoms. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, had the audacity to refer to Albania. He should look nearer home first. Not alone are women very much in the minority in the Oireachtas but the overriding voices of professional and anti-abortion campaigners have attempted to drown out the voices of women and men outside this House. I believe the Irish electorate have grown and matured since the deadly divisive debate of 1983 and will speak out on behalf of women and the groups they represent. I encourage them to stand up and fight for women's right to life. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, referred to such groups. I wish to tell them, and Members on the other side of the House, that criticising this wording is not extreme and is not about advocating abortion on demand. Rather we do not want to add insult to the injury already heaped upon women. The wording on the substantive issue will not ensure women their integrity. During this debate and the 1983 debate — this is one of the abiding memories of women — women have been disembodied, divided and dehumanised. As has been said by Deputy Shatter and others on this side of the House, if it was attempted constitutionally and legislatively to distinguish between the life and health of men there would be an outcry they would have justifiable grounds for rejecting such an attempt. However, because this issue relates to women this charade and farce can take place. It is significant that other moral areas affecting life and death can be given flexibility and justification by men. For example, self-defence, the death penalty and, above all, just wars, are not only justified but at times eulogised. What about the loss of life in such cases? Yet, in the 1983 debate, and again in this one, the underlying thrust of the legislation [60] and the debates surrounding it is that women cannot be trusted. An environment is created which would lead people to believe that women would seek abortions frivolously and thoughtlessly — unless male legislators and Constitutions control women, they would queue up to abort their babies. The X case, which began the second stage of this tragic run of referenda, has been pushed aside and covered up. The position of a 14-year old girl being made pregnant in circumstances which led her to see suicide as the only alternative is now not even up for debate. In fact, the Supreme Court judgment arising from these tragic circumstances, which recognised the real and substantial risk to her life by her suicidal state of mind, is now to be ruled out, is to be denied acceptance if such tragic circumstances are repeated. The X case is not an isolated and solitary one. The rising figures of reported rapes and cases of incest clearly illustrate that other young girls and women will be violated and expected to carry not just the trauma of that desperate experience, but a pregnancy that may ensue from a terrible act inflicted on them through violence and hatred instead of the loving intimate experience it should be. In the face of all this Government speaker after speaker stood up during this debate and have had the insensitivity and callousness to call this wording 'pro-woman' and to accuse women who put their head above the parapet to protest as extremists and lobbyists for abortion on demand. I am amazed at some of the coverage which was given to yesterday's debate which portrayed the speches from the other side of the House as being clever or compassionate. That shows the chasm which exists outside this House with regard to the integrity of women. Women have to sit inside and outside this House and hear their biological and physical bodies taken apart, as rules are drawn up and decisions made about the uterus, ectopic pregnancies and breast cancer. I wonder how men would feel if they were taken apart in this way, if legal and professional decisions about their intimate parts and [61] health were made public and devalued in this way. This debate is taking place in a vacuum with regard to the real lives and experiences of women. It is taken in isolation from the reasons and desperation that force women to seek abortion. If we really care about the moral dilemma of abortion and the concerted action of all of us to reduce circumstances in which abortion takes place at all levels, there should be a platform of support, services and caring to allow that to happen. Indeed, the Minister for Justice, and other Ministers, should ensure that that is in place before we go to the country with referenda. In countries such as the Netherlands where there is a mature, honest, open sex education programme highlighting the responsibility of valuing women's and men's sexuality, teaching young people the long term implications of unplanned pregnancies, there is a low level of abortion. The people of that country are informed and trusted, which is something that the politicians opposite consider unacceptable here. What support services do we have here? In a survey published this week by the US Population Crisis Centre in Washington, Ireland ranks last among the world's 29 developed countries with access to birth control. The Republic of Ireland scored 40 out of a possible 100 points awarded on a range of birth control options — even Romania and Poland preceded Ireland with a score of 51 points.;2626347

A Chathaoirligh, as a woman, as a feminist, as a liberal and as a life long member of Fianna Fáil I very much welcome [36] the amendments we in Government are putting before the people of Ireland on 3 December. Amendment 12 gives full protection to the lives of pregnant women. Amendment 13 ensures that the Constitution cannot be invoked to prevent a woman travelling abroad, whatever the purpose of her journey, and Amendment 14 means that the Constitution cannot be invoked to prevent the dissemination of information about services lawfully available for women in another State. Yesterday Deputy Shatter spoke in this House of the docile acceptance by Fianna Fáil women of the wording. About two weeks ago an eminent journalist in the Irish Press also spoke about docile women in Fianna Fáil. I cannot believe that any reasonable man — although I would have to say that I do not count Deputy Shatter in their number — can look at my political track record and hope to get away with calling me docile. Not only am I not politically docile but I was a member of the sub-committee which developed this wording. Because these amendments enhance the position of women in our Constitution, on this issue they enhance the protection and entitlement of women. The amendments should be welcomed by every woman in Ireland. The one that has sparked off most headlines and controversy is the one that has come to be called the substantive issue, and, as far as women are concerned, one phrase in the amendment has been singled out and attacked on the basis that it is offensive to women — that is, the phrase 'as distinct from the health.' I think many women have been concerned by this inclusion. I must also say that political opportunists, frightened of stating openly what they feel on the substantive issue themselves, have used this phrase as a stick to beat the Government with and in the process needlessly heightened the fears of women. The political opportunists have used this phrase to frighten and mislead people. That is precisely what they are using it to do to mislead women into the belief that there is some lack of respect [37] for their health in the way the wording runs. There is no lack of respect. On the contrary, the lack of respect is in the political opportunists on the other side of this House who know very well what the wording means, but who are prepared to sow confusion and dismay rather than acknowledge it.;2626348

O'Malley;Fianna Fáil;Surely the most fundamental lesson to be learned from the X case is that hard case exceptions do occur. Surely this should cause us to pause and ponder the wisdom of our actions in trying to reduce the whole complex question of the balance of rights between a pregnant woman and her unborn to a single constitutional statement. Meanwhile, of course, if we examine the proposed wording in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution, it is clear that some form of limited abortion is still envisaged. Stating that it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of the unborn, unless certain conditions exist, implies that it will be lawful to terminate the life of the unborn if particular conditions do exist. It is my strongly held view, and that of the Progressive Democrats, that inserting a new provision in the Constitution of Ireland is not the proper mechanism to attempt to regulate such exceptional situations.;2626350

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Desmond J. O'Malley;Fianna Fáil;Indeed, looking back on the Dáil debate leading up to the introduction of our Constitution we can see that Eamon de Valera had a clear view as to what should or should not be in the proposed Constitution. As President of the Executive Council he stated on 11 May 1937, at columns 62 and 63 of the Official Reort, in relation to that part of the Constitution which deals with fundamental rights, Article 40 which is the subject of these proposed referenda, and I quote, that 'You have the natural conflict between the rights of the individual and the rights of the [68] community as a whole'. He went on to elaborate: You cannot, however, state those things absolutely. All you can do is to give the fundamental principles to state them clearly and correctly, and leave it to the sense of justice, the goodwill of the community, to work in accordance with the spirit of the declarations. I share this view of the Constitution. It is wrong to seek to burden our basic law with detailed controls which ought to be the responsibility of the Legislature. Article 40 of the Constitution covering fundamental rights should confine itself to a positive affirmation of basic rights of the individual, with the necessary regulations controlling or limiting such rights demarcated by legislation. In that context let us look at what happened in 1983. The 1983 Amendment to Article 40 inserted a requirement that the life of the unborn be protected. This was a laudable aspiration. But it was a right qualified in its formulation by the necessity to have and I quote: 'due regard to the equal right to life of the mother'. Debate adjourned.

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn;Fianna Fáil;Why does the wording include the phrase 'as distinct from the health'? Let us get one thing clear — the pedigree behind the phrase is very distinguished. It was used by the Chief Justice in his judgment in the X case. Not only that, but as the Minister for Justice pointed out yesterday in this House, the other judges also focused on a risk to life rather than a risk to health in their judgments. Why then should women have expressed concern? Part of the reason was a view expressed by some doctors that introducing the phrase 'as distinct from the health' could be seen as limiting the flexibility which doctors are permitted to exercise in the best interests of the patient under current medical practice. The concern of those doctors was that the wording might result in pushing them for a greater degree of certainty about the risk to the mother's life before giving treatment which might result in the loss of the foetus. As all of us know, normal medical practice operates on the basis of probability, not certainty. If those are the concerns of women — mirroring the concerns of doctors — let me offer some ease and clarification. The amendment is not seeking from doctors a greater degree of certainty about the risk to the mother's life before providing treatment. Nothing in the wording changes the basic test given by the Supreme Court in the X case as 'a real and substantial risk to the mother's life arising as a matter of probability.' Let me put it [38] more bluntly — pregnant women will not be denied medical or surgical treatment necessary to protect their health. As at present, under the amendment women will receive all treatment necessary to protect their health. The question of termination only arises where there is a threat to the mother's life. Let us imagine, for a moment, that we were to remove the words 'as distinct from the health' from the proposed amendment. This would mean that we were omitting from the constitutional provision which reproduces the essence of the test laid down by the Supreme Court, an element which now would be significant because of its omission. If it could be safely left out, we would leave it out, but we cannot, because if we left it out any future hard case which was not related to a life-threatening condition could be the ground for abortion. I am not scare-mongering I am extrapolating from the British experience. This is precisely what happened there, in the Bourne case, and the end results of that case are clear.;2626355

The Twelfth Amendment seeks to maintain a just and proper balance between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the unborn child. Let me spell out yet another reassurance for women — as the Supreme Court pointed out, the threat to a woman's life need not be immediate. A pregnancy may be terminated if doctors form the view that even after recovering from childbirth other treatment for whatever she was suffering from during the pregnancy would be ineffective to save her life. Overall, the most important reassurance for women comes from the essential meaning of the whole amendment: 'all [39] treatments necessary to save her life will be allowed——;2626357

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn;Fianna Fáil;——and her entitlement to have her right to life vindicated will be safeguarded.' Let me state my personal belief without equivocation. The Government have shown courage and a commitment to women in this wording. Courage? Any wording which provokes the extremes of an argument into such vehement antipathy requires courage. There are safer options but we did not take them. Commitment of women? Of course, because we are being realistic about the threats to a woman's health. Let nobody tell me that a life threatening illness, associated with pregnancy or exacerbated by pregnancy, can never happen. It can happen, does happen and will happen, and when it happens there is an absolute imperative that a doctor has the right to take action involving termination of the pregnancy to save the woman's life. A substantial minority of our doctors see it that way. They believe that there are rare cases where, to save a woman's life, termination of pregnancy is medically indicated. Knowing that there are doctors who have seen such rare cases, how could the Government pretend that they do not exist? How could the Government fail to acknowledge the right to protection of this group of women — this small group of women? We could not fail to acknowledge the right to life of those women. Because we are pro-life in the full meaning of that often abused term, we are pro the life of the unborn and of the mother, and we are, in good conscience and with good intent, seeking to amend our Constitution to express both concerns in a realistic and humane way. It is very easy to be pro-life if you limit your concerns to the life of the unborn. It is also very simplistic and very, very dangerous for women. We must be pro-life in the fullest sense and that is what this wording expresses. Someone once [40] said that there is an answer to every question that is simple, straightforward and wrong. Legislation, as an answer to the abortion question, is simple, straightforward and wrong.;2626359

It is interesting to have members of the Opposition warily predicting a divisive and destructive debate on this issue when, at exactly the same time, those members of the Opposition are using precisely the wording most calculated to create that divisive and destructive debate. Yesterday, in this House, members of the Opposition chose to use words like 'cruelty', 'brutal and divisive', 'cowardice', 'misogynistic' and 'immoral'. Who are the Opposition kidding with their sanctimonious predictions that the plain people, left to themselves, will have a graceless and distasteful debate? What could be more graceless and distasteful than the contributions of yesterday, with their intention of raising fears and anger and their deliberate misinterpretations of the implications of the wording? The real truth is that the people can be trusted to conduct their affairs, to debate this issue and to have the final say on this issue. They can be better trusted than some members of the Opposition. I was quite astonished to hear the Leader of the Opposition say yesterday that this was dumping the issue on the Irish people. I find that to be a strange view of the ultimate step in the democratic process.;2626361

If the people decide not to adopt the Twelfth Amendment, then legislation will be introduced by the Government to regulate the position obtaining as a result of the X decision. That is not a threat it is an inevitability. If the position obtaining after the X case is not addressed by way of amendment to the constitution, it has to be dealt with by legislation, and there are no alternatives. The Government are proposing a form of amendment that protects women and protects the unborn. We hope, we trust, we expect that the constitutional amendment will pass, but, to cover the eventuality that it might not pass, we must indicate precisely what our legislative proposals would be to cover that eventuality. That is proper it is necessary it is open, and only speakers with a deadly poverty of ideas would portray it as a threat to anybody.

Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le cearta faisnéise is é an fhoclaíocht atá sa Bhille féin agus arís luaim anocht iad: Ní theorannóidh an fo-alt seo saoirse chun faisnéis a fháil nó a chur ar fáil sa Stát maidir le seirbhísí atá ar fáil i stát eile ach sin faoi chuimsiú cibé coinníollacha a fhéadfar a leagan síos le dlí.

Maidir leis an cheist ar a dtugtar an phríomhcheist, níl aon athrú ar alt 40. 3.3º de Bhunreacht na hÉireann. Ní mhaolóidh na leasuithe atá á moladh anois ag an Rialtas an chosaint bhunreachtúil atá ar fáil don bheo gan bhreith. An fhoclaíocht atá i gceist anseo ag an Rialtas, léifidh mé arís é: Beidh sé aindleathach beatha gan bhreith a fhoirceannadh mura rud é gur gá an foirceannadh sin chun beatha, ar leith ó shláinte, na máthar a shábháil i gcás breoiteacht nó neamhord a bheith ar an máthair is cúis le baol réadach, substaintiúil dá beatha nach baol féindíothaithe é. Tá athrú i gceist sa mhéid is go bhfuil an Rialtas anois ag léiriú a n-imní faoi chás na mban agus ag cur cothromaíochta san áireamh freisin. Tugann an leasú bunreachtúil seo, mar a dúirt mé leis an Teachta Ó Higgins ar an teilifís aréir, cosaint agus ceartas. Tá cosaint ann do bheatha na mban agus tá ceartas acu maidir le cóir iomlán leighis sa chás gur léir go bhfuil a mbeatha i mbaol. Tá sé léirithe cheana féin ag an Taoiseach istigh sa Teach seo agus taobh amuigh de go bhfuil sé in aghaidh an ghinmhillte, agus tá an Rialtas in aghaidh an ghinmhillte, agus ní mhaolaíonn ná ní laghdaíonn an fhoclaíocht atá molta anseo sa Bhille ar aon bhealach an chosaint a thugann an Bunreacht don bheo gan bhreith. [44] Is é atá i gceist anseo againn ná a admháil go gcaithfimid, sa Bhunreacht, cothromaíocht a shocrú idir ceart na máthar chun beatha agus ceart an bheo gan bhreith chun na beatha freisin. Is é atáimid ag cur os comhair an phobail ná, nuair atá baol substaintiúil ann do bheatha na máthar mar gheall ar easláinte, gur ceadmhach do dhochtúirí deireadh a chur leis an toircheas. Is éard atá an Rialtas dáiríre ag iarraidh ar an bpobal anois ná an t-alt bunreachtúil, a chosaíonn ceart beatha na máthar agus an beo gan bhreith a fhágáil mar atá siad, ach ráiteas eile a chur leo ag rá, má bhíonn baol tromchúiseach ann do bheatha na máthar mar gheall ar easláinte, mar a dúirt mé cúpla nóiméad ó shin, go dtabharfar cosaint dá beatha, fiú má chailltear an ghin dá bharr sin. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ná go mbeadh mar aidhm nó mar sprioc leis an gcóir leighis i gcónaí, beatha na máthar a chosaint, agus sa chomthéacs ina bhfuil baol substaintiúil dá beatha, go gceadófaí é. Tá roinnt cásanna — ní cuimhneach liom anois ar luaigh an tAire Dlí agus Cirt iad, sílim go mb'fhéidir gur luaigh, ach is fiú iad a lua arís — mar shampla, rith fola: uaireanta, sa chás sin, ní féidir beatha na máthar a shábháil gan deireadh a chur leis an toircheas galar croí bíonn cásanna ann ina gcaillfí bean thorrach a raibh drochghalar croí uirthi agus gurbh é an t-aon bhealach lena beatha a shábháil ná deireadh a chur leis an toircheas ailse bhroinne: más gá an bhroinn a bhaint as bean cuirtear deireadh leis an toircheas dá bharr sin drochailse chíche, i gcás go mbeadh címeteiripe, nó obráid nó raidtheiripe i gceist, d'fhéadfadh an comhairleoir leighis a mheas nach bhfuil aon rogha ann ach deireadh a chur leis an toircheas mar nach bhféadfaí an chóir leighis a sholáthar ar aon bhealach eile nó go mbeadh sé ró mhall fanacht nó go saolófaí an leanbh. Cásanna ar leith iad seo, agus nuair a bhí mé ag caint i mBéarla ar ball beag dúirt mé é sin, ach ní chreidim gur cheart dúinn iad a fhágáil gan déileáil leo díreach mar nach dtarlaíonn siad do chuile bhean, agus aontaíonn na dochtúirí ar fad atá á lua sna nuachtáin go dtarlaíonn siad, gur féidir [45] leo tarlú agus go dtarlóidh siad sa todhchaí. Mar gheall air sin, creidimse go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach go mbreathnódh an Rialtas air sin, go nglacfadh siad sin ina gcloigne agus iad ag cur leasú den sórt seo faoi réir agus go mbeadh sé clúdaithe in aon leasú a chuirfí ós comhair an phobail.;2626373
896;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;I will not make any apologies for bringing a touch of anger and emotion to this debate. I am deeply angered by the statements of the Minister for Justice in the House yesterday who, once again — similar to actions taken by him and his colleagues in 1983 — is trying to pigeonhole people in this very controversial debate. Who are the extremists with the extreme views to whom he referred in his speech yesterday? Is he referring once again to concerned women who have expressed their horror and offence at certain terminology in the wording of the Twelfth Amendment? How dare this male Minister attempt to categorise women — or indeed anybody — who suggests that the wording is inaccurate and can, therefore, be pigeonholed into one extreme view? Do we not have the history of 1983 to assist us in our assessment that Fianna Fáil got the wording wrong? Why should we trust them again in 1992? I wish to refer to the editorial in the Irish Medical Times of 9 October last because it is salutary to remind ourselves of how we come to be discussing this matter again today. The article states: It is not reassuring to note that those who are most adamant that this or that text be adopted so as to solve the problem were among the most vociferous who argued a decade ago that the wording of Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution would effectively rule out abortion in Ireland forever. Then along came Miss X and the Supreme Court ruling. That ruling, if it did anything, significantly dented the case of those who argue that there is a group of words which, if found, can copperfasten this or that view on abortion. [46] Whatever the final text or the forthcoming referendum, it seems perfectly safe to predict that it will not do what its protagonists insist it will do and we will be back wrangling over the issue. In the last two days four Government Ministers have made speeches. Consistently, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Women's Affairs and the Minister for Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, have assured us that, in absolute terms, they have got it right this time. I should like to remind Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn of what she said in 1983. I will also remind her of what Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Woods and others said. In the Official Report, column 494 of 17 February 1983, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said: People ask why there is a necessity for an amendment to the Constitution. As it now stands the Constitution does not contain any specific protection for human life before birth and only by such an amendment can we be certain that the existing ban on abortion will not be removed as a result of action in the courts.... However, a change in the law could come through the courts without the people or their elected representatives being consulted in any way. Abortion could become legal as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court. As we know, sometimes to our cost, there need not be a unanimous decision of the court. Three out of five judges would be sufficient. At that time Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn made the argument that the 1983 amendment would ensure that no court action would ever allow abortion. How wrong she was. On the same date, column 469, Deputy O'Hanlon said: Fianna Fáil believe the wording we put forward is correct and nothing that has been said has convinced us that we should alter that view. As reported at column 470 he exhorted the Taoiseach to gather his courage, honour his commitment, hold the referendum [47] on the wording presented and give the people an opportunity, in the most democratic way, to enshrine protection for the unborn child in our Constitution. How hollow those words now sound. On 9 February Deputy Woods, the then Minister for Health, said that the thorough consultations that took place before the wording was finalised made it a model for constitutional change for the future. What a model. Deputy Woods gave the impression at the time that there had been such widespread consultation there was no danger the wording would do what Fine Gael warned against. On 27 April — column 2219 of the Official Report, the then Minister for Justice Deputy Noonan, said: There is nothing available to me, in the documentation that came from the Department of Health, to show that any analysis of the wording proposed was done. I wonder was an analysis done in the Department of Health. If there was, why is it not on file there? If it is not on file there why is Deputy Woods not able to inform us of that analysis here in the House today? It is important to remind ourselves, by quoting those excerpts from 1983, how certain Fianna Fáil were at that time that what they were doing was right. It has been proved that there are no absolutes in this case. Let us not have the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, drawing himself up to his full height of six foot four inches and telling us that he now has it right, that he can now play God and present the country with a set of wordings which will not have any side effects. It is clear that 92 per cent of the membership of this House, particularly the Minister for Justice, will never have to face the trauma of an ectopic pregnancy they will never have to face a decision, with their doctor, as to whether their uteri should be removed because of cancer, which means facing the loss of one's womanhood and the growing baby inside. The Minister will never have to face a decision, with his doctor, in that regard or lie on a bed dangerously ill [48] while two doctors argue whether the treatment needed is to save his health or his life. There is more confusion and obfuscation on the part of the Government. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in her speech said: 'Putting it more bluntly, pregnant women will not be denied medical or surgical treatment necessary'— one would expect the next words to be 'save their lives'— but she says 'necessary to protect their health'. I thought the whole point of Minister Flynn's speech yesterday was that they were not writing into our Constitution anything that was only being done to protect women's health. However, we now have the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, trying to confuse the issue by pretending to women that that protection for their health is included in the wording before the House. Again, we have more obfuscation on the part of the Government. An examination of the wording in the Bill published today on the three ballot papers shows that the wording at the top of the white ballot paper will read, 'Right to Life'. That is a gross distortion, a travesty, and a manipulation of the public by the Fianna Fáil element of the Government — I assume they wrote those words. Of course the substantive wording has an element of right to life and an element of saving life in it but use of the terminology 'right to life' is clearly a Government effort to pretend to the people whom they know are criticising them that the amendment does not allow for direct termination if a woman's life is at risk. What is it about Fianna Fáil spokespeople that they find their throats seizing up, that they are not able to answer a simple question when put to them. Does this Amendment allow a doctor to terminate a pregnancy if a woman's life is at risk? We never get a straight answer to that question because for some reason Fianna Fáil Members cannot say 'yes' to the amendment allowing termination in such circumstances. The Government are afraid that if they answer yes to that question they will not then be able to argue the [49] correctness of allowing a mother's life to be saved by terminating her pregnancy. That is another way in which the Government are trying to fool the people. I should like to refer to the process adopted in the past ten days. I have something to say to the Taoiseach on this. He offered the Opposition leaders a very short time to examine wording which had taken six months to prepare. It is said that despite the fact that a subcommittee had been set up little or no work was done for many of those months. The effect of the words produced gives truth to the rumour that there was a rush in the end to produce a wording. There was a thread of consensus running through the submissions presented to the Taoiseach by the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats. That thread of consensus was based on the deletion of the phrase, 'as distinct from the health'. The Taoiseach made an offer of openness he said that his door was open so that consensus between party leaders might be reached. Why did the Taoiseach not at the very least take up that thread of consensus and delete those words? It strikes me that the Taoiseach refused to listen not only to the people he had invited into his office but also to the many interest groups, particularly women's groups, that had been voicing such concern and had found the words proposed to be insulting and offensive. I should like to tell the Taoiseach that the lives of Irish women are not for sale, abuse or use by him and his unscrupulous party. The cavalier way that the Government decided to treat Irish girls and women is objectionable. The Government seem to have taken the attitude that our women should kneel down and thank the Taoiseach very much for all he has done for Irish women, that women should be very grateful and should allow the Government to make life and death decisions on their behalf. That theme has run through speeches by Government Members. Last night Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, spent most of his time outlining [50] what the Government has done for women — almost as if to say, 'Are you not very glad that we have done all of this for you and, why are you now complaining about this issue?'. There is an attitude creeping into the debate that women should be grateful for what the Government has done for them and that if the Government could do anything else women would be very grateful. Irish women are part and parcel of our society they represent more than 50 per cent of the population, and they do not have to feel guilty or selfish in insisting on their right to full medical treatment if their lives are at risk or if there is some danger to them and their future health and life during a pregnancy. The Government asks us to pat them on the back because they are doing an 'OK job'. The Government are not doing 'OK'. It is clear to anyone who has analysed the past ten days in Irish politics that the Taoiseach's invitation to the Opposition party leaders was no more than a cynical exercise in pretence. That is evidenced by the unrealistic deadlines set—48 hours at first and then a few more days after that. It is clear that the Taoiseach was hellbent on proceeding along his own path all the evidence is there to support that. Now the Minister for Justice, and the Taoiseach, have compounded their lack of respect for the Irish people by announcing in a threatening way — and it does not matter how much they try to sanitise the manner in which the anouncement was made, it was made in a threatening way — that legislation is being prepared to implement the X case judgment and that such legislation will be published during the campaign. That announcement begs the question: if it will be possible to produce legislation during the campaign why is it not possible for the Taoiseach to accede to the request of Fine Gael that he produce legislation on the current wording before it is put to the House and the people? If it is possible, as the Taoiseach seemed to imply, to produce legislation on the X case — a line of action the Taoiseach seemed to favour six months ago — without bringing in abortion on demand, and I am [51] perfectly willing to accept that the Taoiseach does not want to do that — why did he not take that action on the substantive issue rather than make provision for a referendum? If it was possible to use the production of legislation as a type of threat before we vote on 3 December, why was the Taoiseach not able to present to the Opposition parties and the people a formula that tightened up on the X case judgment, if that is what he wanted to do, and then use that to phrase a constitutional wording that could be put to the people? That issue begs the question about the Taoiseach's bona fides in asking the Opposition parties to talk to him. All are agreed that the travel and information elements of the X case have to be handled by way of constitutional referenda but the Taoiseach, in announcing the legislation he intends to publish during the campaign, has thrown doubt on whether the referendum on the substantive issue is needed. I wish to say to the Taoiseach — I hope he is listening to this debate because it is important he hears what is being said — that this is not some kind of childish game we are engaged in. We are not dealing with a group of children who can be warned that the bogey man will take them away if they do not eat their vegetables. We are dealing with a serious life and death issue, and to use the big stick of threatening legislation is nothing but a deeply offensive and cynical exercise that will cause further confusion. I now wish to make a very serious allegation. The Taoiseach, by his unwillingness to accept and give consideration to realistic suggestions made by Fine Gael — and, indeed, other Opposition parties — to produce legislation before the vote on 3 December to clarify what we are voting for, runs the risk of subverting the Irish people's well-known call that there be no abortion on demand because another Supreme Court decision could have that effect. Is the Taoiseach willing to run that risk? It seems he is. It is ironic that the people who demanded, in good faith — I am not [52] about to recognise their good faith now — a referendum in 1983 are the self-same people who have to take the blame for what happened in the X case. They opened up the possibility of putting into our Constitution an amendment that clearly will not cover all contingencies. They did not listen in 1983. It took a great deal of courage on the part of Deputy Garret FitzGerald — anybody who listened to the Deputy in the debate last night would have heard him admit this — to admit that he rushed into accepting the 1982 wording from Fianna Fáil but as soon as he recognised the dangers in it he pulled back. It took a lot of courage to do that. I can guarantee that Fianna Fáil would not have that courage but why can they not learn from such courage? It is important to put again on the record of the House what Deputy Shatter said on 17 February 1983, column 533 of the Official Report. He said: The irony is that I have no doubt, not merely from the interpretation the Attorney General has given but from the other interpretations that can be validly taken from the amendment, that if it in its present form becomes part of our Constitution it will essentially secure a constitutional judgment in the not too distant future requiring the House to enact legislation to permit women to have abortions. Deputy O'Hanlon commented on 17 February 1983 column No. 466 of the Official Report: From my own experience as a medical practitioner, from what I have read in literature and from what I know from my colleagues. I do not believe it is necessary to introduce abortion for the medical cases which are quoted by those who are against the amendment because they want abortion legalised. What Deputy O'Hanlon referred to in that extract are the very things that the Government are now saying, at least we hope they are saying it — that women will be allowed to have a termination if [53] their lives are threatened by those medical conditions. It was Deputy O'Hanlon, a medical doctor, who said he did not believe it was necessary to introduce abortion. He is now a member of a Government party that is doing precisely that, again, it highlights the weakness of the arguments in 1983. I should like to refer further to what Deputy Shatter said. At that time I suppose Deputy Shatter was the nearest we had got to a prophet because it was as if he was able to foresee what happened in 1992. He stated column 580 of the Official Report of 17 February 1983: If the intention of the article is to protect the equal right to life of the mother, one must ask what that means. Does it mean that if a mother's life is seriously endangered by a pregnancy, we would allow the pregnancy to go through a full term and possibly keep the mother alive on a life support machine or does it mean something more than just preserving a physical existence? Has the quality of life some relevance to this argument? If it does, if included in the Constitution, would this Article permit abortions to take place where not only a woman's physical health but her mental health was endangered? Shades of the X case. Could it not equally be argued that the right of the mother to life requires a right to a proper and viable life in mental good health? Is that not valid argument? If that were the final judicial interpretation of this amendment, then this amendment would permit abortions to be carried out where a mother's mental health was said by psychiatrists to be endangered as a result of her becoming pregnant. I do not believe that that is an intent on the part of the drafters of this Article. The interpretations to which the Attorney General has referred, the worries which the Minister has expressed and the additional possible interpretations of this Article in the area of abortion which I have given all [54] have validity. There is not a Member of this House who can categorically state that if this matter were dealt with before our courts this year, next year, or in 20 years time, one of these interpretations to permit, and indeed constitutionally require, abortion would not be accepted. It is not something that could be constitutionally required under the existing Constitution, without this Article. Deputy Shatter foresaw precisely what was going to happen sometime in the future — the future happens to be 1992. Almost word for word Deputy Shatter's comments at that time have come to pass. I want those words to remain in the minds of Fianna Fáil so that they can recognise that standing up here and being absolutist about anything is not the case to make on this issue. May I have an indication of the time remaining at my disposal?;2626374
897;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Brian O'Shea;The Labour Party;The whole issue in relation to the life and health of pregnant women falls into a number of different areas. It has a moral dimension, a civil rights dimension and a health dimension. The first question that arises is whether a woman has a civil right to life and health and, indeed, in the context of public morality she has a moral right to her life and health. Law must concern itself with the balance between the rights of the individual and the common good. In the context of the life and health of the woman, what constitutes the common good? Central to this issue is how the life and health of women relate to the common good. There appears to be virtual unanimity in this House on the matter of the civil rights of the woman to her life where there is a real and substantial risk to her life during pregnancy. The medical procedures necessary to save her life would be lawful if the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution is made by the people. However, the Labour Party have difficulties in regard to the inclusion of the word 'save'. The Labour Party would submit that the word 'protect' should be substituted for the word 'save'. The protection of the life of a woman, as distinct from saving her life, must surely be the superior concept in relation to the civil and moral right to life of the pregnant woman. The word 'save' has the connotation of dealing [217] with an imminent crisis while the word 'protect' would allow for the appropriate treatment at an earlier stage which would, is some instances at least, prevent possible long-term damage to the health of the woman. This raises the distinction between what exactly is meant by health as distinct from the life of the mother. Where is the cut-off point between what the Amendment contemplates as the life of the mother and the health of the mother? What are the specific guidelines in relation to this? Is such a distinction either possible or desirable? It is generally agreed that there are no certainties in medical matters. Whether the life or the health of the mother is at risk in particular circumstances is very much a matter of opinion. Therefore, should the pregnant woman in a civilised society be exposed to this type of danger? The Labour Party are a pro-life party in all the many manifestations of that concept. Unfortunately, for all legislators the issue which we are discussing brings us to making judgments and decisions where the options are all, to some extent, distasteful. This should not deter us from taking the right decisions without fear or favour bearing in mind the human and civil rights factors involved. When the options are all undesirable then the integrity and value of Dáil Éireann is tested. If we do not act effectively to protect the life and health of pregnant women, we will have betrayed the mandate given us by the people who elected us and, in particular, by women. With regard to the protection of the life and health of pregnant women, the medical treatment to be carried out must at the end of the day, following medical advice, be the choice of the woman. She should be supported by comprehensive counselling and medical advice on the one hand and her partner on the other. The key word is 'compassion', and this compassion must be free from doctrinaire positions of whatever hue. When there is a real and substantial risk to the life or health of the mother, then the necessary protective treatment should not be withheld. This is an area [218] which requires legislation as distinct from constitutional amendments. The Constitution is a document which essentially states principles. An issue as complex and individual as abortion requires different and more comprehensive treatment. No two cases are the same, and we need legislation which is comprehensive enough to embrace all contingencies where there is a real and substantial risk to the life or health of the mother. There are those who say that politicians cannot be trusted on this issue. I find such remarks offensive. The people gave us a mandate and entrusted us with putting in place legislation which essentially protects individual rights and promotes the common good. Whereas the Labour Party have problems with the amendments in relation to travel and information and will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage, there is widespread agreement on these issues in the House. The issue of information is very basic. With regard to women who travel abroad to have an abortion, there is an enormous obligation on all of us. I am referring to the Members of his House, the Members of the Seanad, public representatives of whatever hue and all the organisations who campaign on this issue from whatever point of view. We must create a caring environment which provides all the supports necessary, including easy access to the very best counselling and medical advice. This would lead to a reduction in the number of women travelling abroad to have abortions. How many of the women who travel abroad to have abortions do so feeling abandoned and alone and are acting out of panic? We must adopt a caring attitude and look at the problems surrounding this issue. As I said earlier, the options in this area are distasteful there is no option which will get us out of difficulty. We must have the courage and compassion to ensure that the civil rights of women are protected. I believe the protection of a woman's health and life should be the central issue. This issue is not properly addressed in these amendments: in fact, the health [219] aspect is not catered for at all. This is an unfortunate line to follow and one which I believe we will regret taking. Because of the way they are drafted, these amendments will very shortly be back before the courts of the land and this issue could very well return to this House at a later stage. Like Deputy Kemmy, I believe that in many ways this debate has been a waste of time. As I said, we should introduce legislation. This is the only appropriate way to deal with such a sensitive, comprehensive and difficult issue.;2626655
898;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Liam Lawlor;Fianna Fáil;It is not surprising that I should congratulate the Government on having fulfilled the commitment to hold a referendum on travel and information and to put forward a solution on the substantive issue. The sceptics who predicted that this would not be possible or who doubted the Government's good faith have once again been confounded. The travel and information referenda have been broadly welcomed. They also arise from the X case. Interference with the freedom to travel is not acceptable in a modern democratic State. There is also wide consensus that anyone who wishes to seek an abortion abroad should at least be given all the alternative options and non-directive counselling. It would be ridiculous, however, if the people were to be consulted about these matters and not about the main issue of abortion. Such a strategy would run the risk of having a negative impact on the chances of success, particularly in regard to the information referendum. The principle underlying the 1983 referendum was that the people would be consulted again if there was any question of legalising abortion. This matter has arisen unexpectedly as a result of the Supreme Court judgment [230] in the X case and therefore it has to be addressed. It would be a denial of democracy to allow the legalisation of abortion without consulting the people again. We gave a very firm commitment before the vote on the Maastricht Treaty and we are now taking the correct and proper action. There are those on the Opposition benches who say that dealing with this matter by way of referendum has demonstrably failed. I reject that argument. Abortion as a public policy issue was bound to have arisen in some form in the past ten years. It has been deeply controversial and divisive in America, Britain, Germany and Italy. Perhaps the best example is Belgium, where the King abdicated temporarily for 24 hours rather than sign the legislation passed in the Belgian Parliament. We have to be able to grasp the nettle. This the Government are doing in putting forward pragmatic and realistic proposals. Fine Gael should not be allowed to forget the key role they played in 1981 in the decision to have this issue dealt with originally by way of referendum. Deputy Garret FitzGerald and the then Senator Gemma Hussey met members of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign on 30 April 1981 and gave them an instant pledge, without proper reflection as to whether this was the proper way to proceed. It left us in Fianna Fáil with little choice but to give a similar commitment a few weeks later. Unlike Fine Gael who had a cynical attitude to election pledges, considering that they could be forgotten or watered down once they had achieved their purpose, Fianna Fáil, back in Government in 1982, proceeded conscientiously to find a suitable wording in accordance with their pledge. When the first wording was published in November 1982 Deputy FitzGerald had it legally examined and made a public commitment to put it before the people before 31 March 1983. Once again trying to go one better then us in Fianna Fáil, Deputy FitzGerald wrote to PLAC on 6 November as follows: The referendum will not be delayed [231] by any other consideration. This is an integral part of our programme and will be undertaken by any Government that I may have the responsibility of leading after the next election. A couple of months later Deputy FitzGerald, safely back in Government, backed away from this solemn commitment, with some legal cover provided by the then Attorney General, whose objections were dismissed by the late Deputy John Kelly, one of the country's foremost constitutional lawyers. Legal queries are, of course, possible in relation to any law or constitutional provision that is subject to interpretation by the courts. Deputy FitzGerald's gross breach of faith with the electorate could not be stomached by several of his back benchers or by nearly half of the Labour Party who voted to ensure that the original 1982 wording chosen by Fianna Fáil was put to the people. The Supreme Court decision in the X case has been very controversial. It has not been accepted as being valid by many lawyers and it was not reasonably foreseeable. The question of suicide was not raised by the Attorney General or by anybody else in 1982-83. The 1983 Amendment was based on the excellent principle of the equal right to life of the mother and of the unborn. Few people, other than those who were openly looking for liberal abortion law, had challenged that principle. The Supreme Court judgment in the X case requires us to further clarify this principle. The Government have done that in a way that should be reassuring to mothers and pregnant women, removing any worries as to how the equal right to life principle should be interpreted in practice. The additional principle which is set out ensures that any pregnant woman who has a life-threatening condition will be given all the necessary treatment and that will be the case whatever the condition and whatever the recommended treatment. Obviously, the doctor has an obligation, where possible, to ensure that a live child is born but there is no sense [232] in allowing both mother and the foetus to die for want of treatment. While medical opinion is divided, there is sufficient weight of evidence to suggest that a termination may occasionally be required to save a woman's life. This cuts across the direct-indirect distinction which is not a medical or legal distinction. It could interfere with existing medical practice and introduce a certain amount of confusion and uncertainty for doctors, patients and the courts. As the chairman of the Institute of Gynaecologists said in a letter to The Irish Times on 16 October, there is no consensus on the matter among the medical profession and this is not a black and white area. In that connection, I note a rather striking contradiction between the position of SPUC in Britain — who supplied most of the literature for the Irish Pro-Life Movement during the Maastricht campaign, as set out in last Saturday's Irish Press— and SPUC here. SPUC in Britain acknowledge that abortion to save the mother's life was legal before the Act and they do not dispute that it should be. It seems that there is a serious difference of view between SPUC in Britain and the Irish branch as to what is realistically the right position to take. There is a folklore that goes back a long way with regard to women with cancer being told by priests or doctors that they may not be treated and that by implication they will be left to die. Leaving people to die when they could be saved is not a great pro-life position. Indeed, it is the opposite. Fianna Fáil in their proposal clearly repudiate that kind of inhumanity to the extent that it still persists. The substance of the proposal is very pro-woman and represents a significant advance in terms of clarification of the position. We have not bowed to pressures to use ideological language in this debate or in the proposal we will put to the people. If this referendum is defeated we will not hold another with a different tougher wording. Either the referendum is passed or abortion will remain legal in cases where the woman claims to be suicidal with the backing of a psychiatric report. All the [233] international evidence suggests that this would create a very dangerous loophole. While supporting the referendum, Fine Gael are asking for legislation. I vigorously disagree with them. There is no case for the legislators to come between the medical profession and the patient, and I detect little demand for legislation from the medical profession. Legislators cannot foresee all possible medical circumstances. It is far better to leave it between the doctor and patient in accordance with clear general principles, than to establish or attempt to establish a maze of regulations. Irish maternity hospitals have adequately dealt with this rather complex legal matter for many years in a realistic and intelligent way. If the Supreme Court, barring the question of suicide in Deputy FitzGerald's words, removed the ambiguity in the original wording, what possible objection could we have to incorporating the key passage in the Supreme Court judgment word for word into the Constitution? There has been criticism of the distinction drawn with regard to health. The distinction is drawn directly from the Supreme Court judgment which parties opposite appeared to approve. If the clause is left out we could be faced with a Y case where the meaning of the term 'life' is extended to include the quality of life, which is a nebulous concept which would require us in the future to hold yet another referendum on the subject. I do not know if Fine Gael, Labour or most representative groups are demanding that a health risk should be sufficient for termination of a pregnancy. Are they familiar with the language of the 1967 aborton laws in England which permits termination if the continuation of a pregnancy would involve risk of injury to either the physical or mental health of woman? That is what has led to abortion on demand. The language is very plausible but it leads to results different from what may be intended. Are those who are saying that they do not like the distinction saying that in order to save the health of the mother termination should be allowed? Have they any proposals as to [234] how such a clause could be implemented without risk of further abuse? People have objected to the exclusion of suicide, although with the exception of Deputy Nuala Fennell, it has been supported by Fine Gael. It is being excluded because it is obviously open to abuse. It is very difficult to determine conclusively another person's intention even if one is a trained psychiatrist. It is therefore inadvisable to legislate for it. Studies have shown that, for instance, in Minnesota between 1950 and 1965 when suicide was an allowable grounds for therapeutic abortion, over 60 per cent of all abortions took place on that grounds, yet figures for actual suicides were negligible. During the seventies in the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin there was not a single case of suicide reported. Anyone genuinely suicidal, with the persons caring for her, will have the option to travel, if that is the only solution they see, even though I am sure excellent counselling will be available. There have been some criticisms from the Church of Ireland. We in Fianna Fáil ensured in 1983 and today that sectarian language was not put into our Constitution. The substances of the Government's proposal is very close to the criteria of the Church of Ireland, that strict and undeniable medical necessity is the only justification for the termination of pregnancy. While respecting the preference for legislation, it would not be the proper democratic process. The general principle can work and our proposal is better than legislation because it leaves the responsibility with the medical profession who will have no serious difficulty working with the wording, as the president of the IMO confirmed. As legislators we have a wide responsibility to society. Our personal religious convictions, while important, cannot be our sole guide to sensitive and controversial social issues. The Churches will respect, as they have in the past, their different role in setting out their moral teaching and our role as legislators who must have regard to our proposals workability and defensibility in terms of public policy. As a country we are faced with [235] many pressing economic and other problems. There is no case for prolonging the debate. The vast majority of people want the proposition to be put to them so that they can decide on it, so that we can all move to other business as quickly as possible. It is certainly not the Government who wish to prolong this unavoidable diversion of public attention from other important issues. Fianna Fáil had the courage to take up a clear position on this most difficult of issues. The Democratic Left Party, to be fair to them, have done likewise. I look forward to hearing more of the substantive thinking of Fine Gael and Labour as opposed to their procedure of drafting points. It is amazing that Fine Gael both on this issue, and on the Green Paper on Education last Friday, suggested that the time for making submissions on these issues was too short. We have had the Supreme Court judgment, the wording, and our commitment during the referendum on the Masstricht Treaty but when the crunch came after the Cabinet sub-committee concluded their work and produced recommendations for the three referenda they are still asking for more time.;2626656
899;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Desmond J. O'Malley;Fianna Fáil;Before the debate was adjourned I was saying that the 1983 [179] Amendment had inserted a requirement in the Constitution that the life of the unborn be protected. I said that this was a laudable aspiration. I went on to say that it was a right qualified in its forumlation by the necessity to have 'due regard to the equal right to life of the mother'. It was, and it remains, the responsibility of this House to provide the detailed legislation which is necessary to strike the balance between such rights. This fact was envisaged in the 1983 Eight Amendment where the State guaranteed 'in its laws to respect, and, as far as practical, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right'. As the recently tragically deceased Mr. Justice Neil McCarthy pointed out in his judgment in the X case, we in this House have been remiss in our duty by failing to provide such legislation which, as I said, is specifically required by the terms of the Constitution. In contrast, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, dealing with the question of information, which is also before us, is consistent with this requirement. It inserts a right in the Constitution and leaves to legislation its detailed control. The Minister for Health has given the House an outline of the likely terms of such possible legislation. That is why, no matter what the people of Ireland decide in December regarding the Twelfth Amendment on the so-called substantive issue, the Progressive Democrats believe that legislation will be essential to guide doctors in dealing with the real life cases that simply will not readily comply with the formal constitutional text now proposed. To do otherwise would force the Supreme Court to continue to have to make the law on a case by case basis. Given the reality of the Supreme Court judgment, and irrespective of the outcome of the constitutional referenda on 3 December, medical terminations will be lawful in Ireland in certain limited circumstances. Are we now to allow this situation to apply without any legislative control? How are our doctors to decide on the hard cases, the border line cases and the emergency cases? Will they have to [180] endure a threat of having their judgment challenged after the fact in some criminal suit? Will the woman's life be put at risk otherwise because they are unsure of their position? How are doctors to define the elusive dividing line between life-threatening and life-shortening situations? It should be clear to everyone, therefore, that a legislative framework will be required, irrespective of the decision of the people on the Twelfth Amendment on 3 December. In this context too it is important to remember that there is little point in asserting that such and such a medical procedure will not be affected by the proposed constitutional amendment. I repeat that the reality is that when the constitutional provision is subject to interpretation by the Supreme Court, the judges can only adjudicate on the basis of the words in the Constitution and not by reference to any other words or documents, no matter how well-intentioned such clarifications may now seek to be. A particular concern about the wording before the House is the proposal to totally exclude the danger of self-destruction or suicide from any consideration in a possible medical termination of pregnancy. I am aware of the arguments for such a provision and certainly it would be unacceptable to allow a mere plea of suicidal intent as a general basis for seeking a termination, but I believe that the particular proposal before us is too absolutist a position. First, suicidal disposition was the basis on which the X case was decided. Had we such an exclusion in the first place, at that time, the Supreme Court would not have been able to reverse the Costello judgment, and the injunction against the 14 year old travelling would have remained. People must ask themselves would they really have supported the continuation of such a situation? Do they believe that the Supreme Court judges were correct in lifting the injunction? Second, I believe that the real danger of suicide as a basis for termination could be adequately controlled by legislation so as to prevent it becoming an abused pretext for the availability of abortion in [181] Ireland. Article 40. 3.3º already provides the basis for such legislation. Whether or not we like it, there will be some genuine cases of intended suicide, however few. Since the Supreme Court decision in the X case there has been no sudden rush to the courts by women looking for an abortion on the basis that they are suicidal. This is not a particular problem now, and there is no pressing reason to exclude it constitutionally as a basis for a termination in every case in the future. We must be willing to consider the fact that some very unusual suicide case may arise where the woman cannot for some reason or another leave the jurisdiction, and where a real and unavoidable risk of self-destruction exists. For example, a young pregnant girl may become severely anorexic after a multiple rape. Such a girl, with her unborn, could be condemned by this Amendment, with the hands of the Supreme Court tied, thus preventing any sensible intervention to save her life. I would seriously question the basis for putting such an absolute ban in our Constitution. I believe that it is undesirable. Another major concern about the proposed Amendment wording is the distinction to be drawn in the Constitution between 'life' and 'health'. This could take away from doctors, from the courts and from this House any right to deal with those hard cases which will arise. No one can really know whether a pregnancy which will, as a matter of probability, drastically shorten and devastate a woman's life, will be permitted to be terminated under this proposal. It seems to me that the wording is calculated to try to distinguish between life shortening and life threatening pregnancies and to exclude completely 'life shortening' risks as a ground for termination. This provision scarcely reflects reality and fails any objective analysis. Furthermore, it is not easily interpreted. The distinction between life threatening and life shortening is clearly problematical. Are we as a people to say to some women: because this pregnancy will not kill you now but will only leave you [182] immobilised, maybe a physical or mental wreck, and perhaps with a dramatically reduced life expectancy, you may not have a particular treatment? We should also recognise the fact that the proposed Amendment will put at risk the position of the existing Article 40. 3.3º in so far as it removes the protection of Protocol 17 of the Maastricht Treaty by modifying the Article which the Protocol protects. Furthermore, it is accepted by all that any new insertion will not be protected from scrutiny by the European Court of Justice. It is somewhat doubtful whether or not our European partners would agree to change the Protocol to protect the proposed Twelfth Amendment if passed. I now wish to turn briefly to the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution Bills. These honour the commitment given by the four party leaders at the time of the Maastricht Referendum to provide travel and information rights. The Progressive Democrats have no hesitation in supporting the passage of these two Bills in this House and in recommending them to the people for endorsement. We support them because we believe that travel and information are basic human rights, which should not be limited by the State except for the most pressing and exceptional of public policy reasons. It is, I believe, unacceptable to attempt to restrict travel to avail of services legally available in other states and similarly wrong in practice, and in principle, to ban absolutely all information about such services. By denying information to women about abortion in England, we are also ruling out the possibility that comprehensive, non-directive information could lead to some women rejecting that option. If such information becomes available only when a women arrives at the clinic in England, after she has undergone the trauma of deciding on an abortion put together the money necessary for the treatment and, perhaps, contrived a pretext for her travel, she may simply not even want to consider any alternative course of action, such as keeping the [183] child or having it adopted. We therefore support the passage of these two Bills in this House. We welcome the cross-party support for them and invite the people to support them in the forthcoming referenda. The three measures before the House arise out of decisions of the Government made after consideration of the issues involved by a sub-committee of the Cabinet, of which I was a member. Because they are Government Bills, and because the Government meet and act as a collective authority, or ought to do, their members, including myself, are bound to carry through their decisions or else resign from the Government. In present circumstances, therefore, I consider that it would be inconsistent with membership of the Government for us now to vote against any of these Bills in the Oireachtas. That, in turn, presents any member of Government who disagrees with the substance of any of these measures with a choice, to allow the proposal to go before the people who are the sovereign authority in our constitutional scheme of things for their decision, or to resign from Government and precipitate a general election. The latter course of action would also prevent me and the other party leaders from honouring the pledge we gave during the Maastricht referendum campaign that a referendum would be held this year to restore rights of travel and information. The passage of the Bills will give all the people, including Irish women, the opportunity to pass judgment on these proposals. The Progressive Democrats as a party will collectively publish their analysis and advice on the measures proposed and I have no doubt that, as a political party, we will advise the electorate and our own supporters in clear terms during the course of the campaign. The issue now before this House is as to whether the matter should be put before the people for their consideration. We are enacting nothing here in our consideration of these Bills. Unfortunately, the debate up to 3 December is [184] likely to be divisive and will damage the cohesion of our society. A foretaste of the debate has already alarmed many, but to plunge the country now into an abortion election as it would undoubtedly be dubbed, would be unforgivable.;2626657

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Pat McCartan;The Workers' Party;I thank my Labour Party colleagues for sharing their time with Deputy Gilmore and me. In the immediate wake of the X case in February of this year it was apparent that there was a collective and resolute will among all Members of this House to deal with the issues and problems thrown up by that unfortunate case. I think there was almost an expectancy among all of us that the Government were going to take speedy and decisive action to legislate so that that type of case could never happen again during our time. It is greatly regretted that that vast potential and the real consensus which was emerging has been squandered and thwarted by the Government through their actions over the past few days in respect of the legislation before the House. What the Government are now proposing has, if we listen to the Progressive Democrats [220] Deputies and to what Deputy Lenihan had to say, left many Deputies on that side of the House and on this side of the House in very great difficulties. I will deal with these briefly. It is suggested that a pregnancy can only be terminated to save the life as distinct from the health of the mother. Apart from the huge uncertainty for women and doctors in trying to understand and interpret that concept, the very thinking behind it is offensive and anti-life. The right to life as we understand it in our Constitution is not just a right to survive it involves a right to a healthy and vibrant life. It seeks to guarantee a living person the means and capacity to enjoy life and actively participate in it. In the X case in the Supreme Court Mr. Justice O'Flaherty put the matter extremely well in his judgment and I quote: Can it be that a Constitution which requires the State to look to the economic needs of mothers is unconcerned for the health and welfare and happiness of mothers? I am certain that reading the Constitution as a whole, as I believe one must do, then the answer is clearly not. A broad dimension must be given to the Constitution and a narrow or pedantic approach to its provisions has to be put aside. This judge, who is often regarded as conservative in his view and interpretation of the Constitution recognises the essential ingredient of happiness, of people's right not just to life but also the right to be able to actively enjoy that life. Attempting to define a difference between the life as opposed to the health of a woman is divisive and unnecessary. In cases where medical opinion is that a woman's life or health is at a substantial risk from a continued pregnancy, then abortion — and I say this unequivocally — should be an option available to her. In this context of health, I have no hesitancy in including the concept of a threat to health as presented by suicide. I utterly and totally fail to accept the Government's line of thinking that in dealing with the health of a woman one can [221] exclude the threat of suicide as a health concept. It defies all reasoning to say we are legislating to protect the health of a woman while saying that suicide cannot be considered in that context. I am not advocating abortion on demand as other Deputies and myself on this side have been accused of when we have sought the reasoning behind the Government proposals. To suggest that what we are talking about is abortion on demand is both offensive to women and to the medical profession generally. It suggests that women here cannot be trusted to respect their motherhood or, indeed, that beautiful capacity of bearing children to full term. The Government are insulting women and the medical profession by suggesting the right to consider a threat to women's health amounts to seeking abortion on demand. That insult, for what it is worth, is also an insult to women and the medical profession in England. We must not forget that more than 4,000 women — I believe the figure is much closer to 5,000 — travel to Britain each year to terminate unwanted pregnancies. The regime in that country is subject to the same Hippocratic oath and constraints in legislation which apply elsewhere to regulate circumstances in which abortion is available. To suggest that that amounts to abortion on demand is devoid of any reasoning and is insulting to the medical profession and to the women of that country, as it would be to those at home who seek to deal with a very difficult problem here. The facilities which we, as legislators, and the people are asked to endorse by the proposals in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution do not go far enough. When we speak of the right to life and to enjoyment of that life, are we not also obliged to have consideration for the lives and rights of existing children in families? Have they not got a right to the enjoyment of a healthy mother? What good is a mother to her children if she is in a coma? Equally, what good is it if as in the case of Mrs. Hodgers, who survivied the pregnancy for two days but inevitably died. [222] In regard to the Supreme Court decision in the X case, the tragic circumstances which led to that decision must not be forgotten. Those facts have been well rehearsed in this House over the past two days. It must be put clearly on the record that every Member in the House was relieved when the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court which sought to restrain and imprison a 14-year old girl in this country until her child was delivered. That 14-year old girl who was raped and impregnated was ordered by the High Court to stay for the full nine months within the confinement of her home, if not of the State, until she delivered her child. I am waiting to hear one Member of this House say publicly that is what he or she would have wished. We were all relieved when the Supreme Court reversed the decision. That court delivered a judgment which was well reasoned and basically fair in its conclusions. It said that the girl whose life was threatened was entitled to have that pregnancy terminated she was entitled to an abortion and the court did not interfere with her right to travel to England. One may ask why she did not have the abortion here. One wonders if she did. I was particularly annoyed, therefore, in the days leading up to this debate and during it, to hear Members in some way criticising the Supreme Court for their ruling and suggesting that they took us by surprise by delivering an incomprehensible decision. Anyone who argues that the ruling was unacceptable is being grossly dishonest because we were all relieved at the fair decision. The judgment stated that in circumstances where the life of a woman is threatened by a pregnancy there should be available to the woman the right to opt to end that pregnancy. The Supreme Court also said that as long as we have a Constitution which recognises the right to life of a woman there can never be an absolute ban on abortion in our law. To the extent that the Minister for Justice has accepted that proposition, challenged the so-called pro-life camp on this gross misstatement [223] and centred on the propaganda which they would like to see permeating this debate, he must be congratulated. The Minister has recognised that there cannot be an absolute ban on abortion in our administration or in our law. He recognises the fact that where a Constitution is charged with protecting the life of a woman in certain circumstances an occasion may arise when that act of protection must necessarily involve the termination of the foetus. Therefore, I am disappointed that having accepted the basic principle laid down in the Supreme Court judgment the Minister abandoned the final conclusion of the court's ruling in that case, namely, when one came to deal with the health issue, suicide was a factor to be considered. The question of the right to travel is being glossed over. Most Deputies consider the wording to be perfectly acceptable in the way it is couched and in what it purports to do. Its overall role is ludicrous because it is the vehicle whereby we as legislators are saying to pregnant women who wish to terminate their pregnancy that they cannot do it at home but may go elsewhere to do so provided they have the money. That provision is not everything it sets out to be when it is taken in context with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution — on the substantive issue — that a woman may become pregnant against her will and her health is not threatened by that pregnancy. If she confides in her husband or her boyfriend that she intends to travel to England to terminate the pregnancy and the father seeks an injunction through the courts, the issue will be determined by the courts on balancing the right to life of the foetus and the right to parentage by the father against the woman's right to travel. In regard to the manner in which our courts set rights in hierarchy and balance one against the other, I believe that the right and the duty of the court to protect the right to life of the foetus will prevail. Indeed, I believe there is a strong argument to suggest that the right of a parent, of the husband or father, will also prevail over [224] the right of the woman to travel. I am not satisfied that the writing into the Constitution of this provision, in the context of what is provided under the substantive issue, deals with the issue as absolutely as we believe or are led to believe it will. There are many other matters that clearly need to be adressed, dealt with and teased out. I have absolutely no hesitation in saying, in this Chamber and elsewhere, that where a woman is raped or subjected to incest — which is rape in itself — and is impregnated, she must have the absolute right to terminate that pregnancy within a reasonable period of time. It is an obscenity in the extreme to suggest to a woman, who is set upon against her will, impregnated by whatever blackguard and forced to carry an unwanted foetus, that she cannot have the option in her own right, and subject to consultation with her medical advisers, to terminate that offensive pregnancy. I cannot understand how we, as legislators, cannot in all humanity provide for even that restricted situation. The answer, we are told, is that this right will open the door to abortion on demand. I do not accept that concept I am not an advocate of it, but I feel we have certainly no ground for arguing against it in the circumstances where we do not provide reasonable access to contraceptive devices and advice on contraception, where we do not provide any adequate or proper sex education in our curricula in schools, where we provide no public education programme through thd Departmennts of Health or Education in regard to fertility and family reproductive control, and particularly where we provide absolutely no State funded counselling or support services for women carrying an unwanted foetus. In those circumstances we have a total gall to say to women that they have no right to consider the option of abortion. In conclusion, it is a total contradiction that we are providing this legislation for those women who have the means and the ability to travel abroad to terminate their unwanted pregnancies. It is an incredible contradiction heaped upon [225] contradiction. Those contradictions have destroyed a very real potential for consensus to act on this matter that was present in this House in February of this year. The opportunity was not seized upon by the Government and has now, in fact, been destroyed by what the Government have produced over the last few days.;2626662

906;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Ms. Mary Harney;Fianna Fáil;Since this debate began yesterday, approximately 25 Irish women have travelled to Britain for an abortion. Since the X case last February, approximately 3,000 women have gone to Britain for an abortion and last year more than 4,100 Irish girls, according to official statistics, had abortions in Britain or Wales. These are conservative figures and this is the real and substantive issue in this debate. Unfortunately, nothing that is said in this debate will alleviate the plight of those women. Nothing said in this debate will save one single woman from travelling that lonely and isolated road for an abortion. During the past few months many of us have been challenged to reconsider our view about certain matters. That does not come easy. Most people do not like the notion of abortion in fact most people do not like to use the word 'abortion' and the word 'termination' is often used instead. However, for many it is the lesser of two evils. It is the lesser of two evils where a woman's life is at risk, where her health is seriously at risk, or if somebody has been raped or the subject of a sexual crime such as incest. It is also the lesser of two evils where somebody may take her own life. In these limited circumstances — and they are limited — the option of terminating a pregnancy should be available to Irish women in Ireland. In this debate, as in many others, we will continue to export our problem to Britain. Once again, Britain, will provide a solution to an Irish problem. However, if this country was geographically located 2,500 miles into the mid-Atlantic, if we were much further from Britain than we are and if it cost a few hundred pounds to get there, we might take a different approach to the issue we are discussing today. [185] When the X case arose I saw in this House, as I did in the country, a new awakening, understanding and sympathy in relation to the plight of that young girl and her family. I doubt if many people, particularly in this House, would not have chosen a similar route if faced with the same circumstances. That family were trying to do the best they could for their young rape victim, but instead of getting support and help they were confronted by the arms of Government and stopped from taking her to Britian for an abortion. Many people felt disgusted that the insertion of Article 40. 3.3º into the Constitution in 1983 could have had that kind of consequence and, as a result, many of us have had to reconsider our approach to the issue. Unfortunately, the new awakening and sympathy at the time of the X case has slowly ebbed and we have now adopted more polarised views. That is regrettable and it is particularly regrettable that over the past few weeks on many radio and television programmes — and, indeed, in the media generally — we have had to listen to men discuss the female anatomy in a clinical and cold manner, almost as if they were discussing an aircraft or something of that kind. I know many women found it offensive and many men also found it offensive. I would find it equally offensive if men were being discussed in the same fashion. I have not heard any of these men discuss the plight of the 4,190 girls who went to Britain last year for abortions. I have not heard them express the view that the men who impregnated these women should be more responsible for their actions because, unfortunately, while we do not have any statistics in Ireland as to why these women travel, we generally know that many of them make that choice because they believe there is no alternative. It is a lonely, isolated, difficult decision and if we, as a country, really care and want to be compassionate then we must obtain the statistics. We need to find out who they are and why they go. I believe some of them go because they have been deserted and abandoned by the men who [186] made them pregnant. They feel they have nowhere to turn, that there is no alternative. I wish we had better support and caring services for those who find themselves in this position. It is interesting to note, for example, that in a study published in 1990 by Dr Stanley Henshaw it was found that the rate of abortion among Dutch women per 1,000 women in the child bearing years of 15 to 44 was 3. 6 per cent, whereas the rate in Ireland for the same year was 4. 8 per cent. These were Irish women going to Britain for abortions. We have a 1. 2 per cent rate higher than they have in the Netherlands where abortion is freely available. The reason the rate is so low in the Netherlands is because they have a proper system of sex education. They have widespread access to family planning, 80 different counselling centres for people with sexual problems, or who need crisis pregnancy advice and so on. That is the reason the figure is so low and if we really want to make a dent in the high numbers of Irish women seeking abortions abroad, we need to establish a similar programme here. We need proper pregnancy counselling, widespread availability of family planning services, proper sex education and greater support and care services for those who find themselves pregnant. There is no other way of decreasing the level of abortions among Irish women abroad. I regret very much that this debate is taking place almost as if there was an emergency. Midnight sittings of this House tend to occur around budget time, or perhaps towards the summer as we approach the recess, or on other occasions when emergency legislation has to be rushed through the Oireachtas. I do not believe the legislation we are discussing at the moment can in any way be described as emergency legislation. There is no demand in this country for a referendum on this issue, on what is called the substantive issue of abortion. In 1983 most people thought they were voting for legislation that would not allow abortion in most circumstances. They felt that they were fooled then and I do not believe they want to be fooled now. Most [187] people are saying, 'We elected you the legislators it is up to you to make and take decision on our behalf.' Many speakers in this debate and many outside the House have advanced the theory that it is right to let the people decide. I have no principled objection to letting the people decide but we do not let the people decide how much tax they would like to pay. If we are closing down a hospital or restricting health services we do not consult the people in that way. We are elected to make tough and difficult decisions and there is no way that the complex issue of abortion can be dealt with in four or five lines in our Constitution. My voting Yes or No on 3 December will not adequately deal with the complex issue of abortion. That is why I regret very much that it is being approached in this manner. During the Maastricht debate the leaders of the main parties came together and most people applauded that. They felt it was a sign of maturity on the part of the Oireachtas and politics generally. The progress that was made then towards achieving a consensus has been shattered in recent days and the kind of new departure that most people felt was emanating from Leinster House unfortunately has gone. I regret that very much. I also regret that a moral issue such as this is dealt with in a rigid Whip way in this Oireachtas. We are one of the few Parliaments in the civilised, developed world that treats these issues in this way. Most civilised Parliaments allow free votes on what are regarded as moral issues. This is a moral issue. People have very different views and they should be allowed to express them freely in the way they vote in this House. Those who say we must have a referendum because the Legislature cannot be trusted is offensive to Deputies and Senators and it is an insult that we ourselves are compounding by agreeing to go down this route. The recent Family Planning Bill passed in this House certainly would not give any indication that the Legislature is about to open the floodgates. It was a welcome development [188] in some respects but certainly could not be regarded as being extremely liberal. There are those who say that if we do not adopt this approach and have a referendum, and if we do not accept these words, that in some way we will have abortion on demand. It is not a choice between these words or abortion on demand and I and many other people find it insulting to be accused of wanting abortion on demand. Nobody in this House, to the best of my knowledge, wants abortion on demand or believes that abortion should be used as a form of family planning. People genuinely want to see it available only in the hard cases that I mentioned earlier. My problem with these words is twofold. I find it very difficult to accept that we can distinguish between health and life. Recently I was made aware of a case by the extended family of the woman involved, a woman from the west who gave birth to a child three and a half years ago. During the course of her pregnancy she developed toxaemia. As a result of that the woman has been in a coma ever since. In a situation like that, the choice of terminating the pregnancy would not be available under these words to that woman, or to somebody in similar circumstances, and I regret that very much. It is heartbreaking for her family and her friends to see the condition that woman is in as a result of developing an illness during her pregnancy. I wonder who will decide whether the life of the woman is threatened. Will it be the obstetrician? Will it be the cardiologist if the problem is cardiac hypertension? Will it be an oncologist or perhaps a combination of all three? I believe that after this legislation is introduced many doctors will be afraid to carry out any termination. They will be afraid they will leave themselves open to litigation by, perhaps, the husband or some other interested party, because no doctor can ever say with certainty that somebody is going to die in one month, six months or nine months. These words seem to introduce a degree of certainty that is just not possible. It is not medically possible ever to say if somebody is [189] definitely going to die or when that might happen. It is most regrettable that we have approached the issue in this way and I believe many women are deeply disturbed. I regret that the Council for the Status of Women, which is an umbrella body representing 80 different women's organisations, and the Commission for the Status of Women, appointed by the Government two years ago to examine the inequities that still remaim in our society as far as women are concerned, were not adequately consulted. If this was an issue that affected the construction industry, or the farming community, or the vintners, for example, would we be approaching it in the same way? Would there not be widespread consultation? Would people not be going out of their way to ensure the lobby was looked after? Why should women be singled out and treated differently?;2626664

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Eamon Gilmore;The Workers' Party;I would like to thank Deputies McCartan, Kemmy and O'Shea for sharing their time with me. Underlying this whole debate is a deep distrust of women, which I find repugnant, and which I think needs to be faced. There are two issues. Should a woman be permitted to obtain in Ireland an abortion if her health is at risk? Should she be permitted to obtain an abortion if her life is at risk from suicide? The Government says 'no' to both of these questions because they claim that to allow women the freedom of choice in these circumstances, is to open the door to what they call 'abortion on demand'. What is meant by 'abortion on demand'? It is a term which will be used like a bludgeon between now and 3 December to down the arguments of those who oppose the Government's wording. It has already been used by Government Ministers and even by the Taoiseach to castigate the proposals which were put forward by Democratic Left on this subject. So what does the term mean? It is being suggested that Irish women will walk into hospitals like they would ramble into a hairdressers and order an abortion? Do the Government really think that Irish women care so little about maternity and childbirth that their freedom must be restricted not only by legislation, but by force of the Constitution and even by the Treaty on European Union? Do the Government think that women will be claiming to have been raped, that they are suicidal? Do they not realise that women think very seriously about the option of abortion, including women who ultimately decide to proceed with it? Do they not know that women think very [226] seriously about abortion before they decide on that option? What kind of attitude to women lies behind the thinking that such special laws must be made to govern one of the most personal and complex aspects of their human condition? It is argued that what is at issue here is fundamental — that this is an issue of life or death. I think Fintan O'Toole put this argument very well in his article in The Irish Times on Wednesday, 14 October 1992: There is another characteristic sound of the pronouncements on abortion in the last few days. It is the sound of air bubbles breaking the surface, of waves gently lapping over balding heads, of flailing arms thrashing the waters. It is the sound of men who have wandered in past their depth, wearing the hob-nailed boots of political expediency that make them now too clumsy and heavy to turn around and come back again. Men who can't deal with the things that are supposed to be their business, such as jobs and houses and hospitals, suddenly decided that they were up to dealing with nothing less than Life and Death. They discovered their hidden depths and plunged straight into them. Why is it that the issue of life and death evokes such passion only when it relates to women and pregnancy? Why is there no constitutional provision to protect the lives of travellers' children, whose lives are, if I may use the phrase, indirectly terminated by their appalling housing and living conditions? Why is that the issue of direct or indirect killing is never raised in this context or in the context of war? Did the refuelling of American planes at Shannon during the Gulf War lead to the indirect killing of babies in Baghdad? What I am questioning here is why it is that 'the right of life' has become an issue only in relation to women? What the Government are really saying in these measures is that they do not trust women. They do not trust women to make the judgment whether their health or lives are at risk. [227] Human reproduction, fertilisation, pregnancy and childbirth are extremely complex interpersonal issues which do not readily lend themselves to constitutional definitions or regulations. They are sensitive matters which evoke all the range of human emotions, personal differences and diversity which exist between people. It is difficult to envisage a less suitable subject for legalism or constitutional disputation. Indeed it is extraordinary that someone or some group in our society have sought to deal with such a complex human question by way of constitutional provision or by a clumsy legalistic intrusion into the deeply personal world of human relationships. Since the inclusion in 1983 of Article 40. 3.3 in our Constitution we have had considerable fear, shame and misery for pregnant Irish women and collective hypocrisy within Irish society as a whole. The courts have sought to abide by that constitutional provision with extraordinary consequences for many women, children and families. It has made criminals of thousands of Irish women, has aggravated the dilemmas facing couples with unwanted pregnancies, disrupted the intimate doctor-patient relationship and generated a series of unnecessary legal disputes. It has distorted natural human responses to pregnancy and overlaid them with taboos, recriminations and fear. It has made sexual refugees of Irish women, made spies of patients in family planning clinics and revised the medical preoccupations of middle-aged power-brokers with sex and sexuality exerting control over women's bodies and rights. It has proven to be the most persistent source of intolerance and right wing reaction in the Irish Republic in recent years. Now we have a proposal from the Government to add new subsections to Article 40. 3.3º in an effort to deal with perceived 'unacceptable circumstances' arising from the Supreme Court judgment in the X case. We are to have subsections on travel and information and the substantive issue of abortion. Each of these measures was a reaction to the one which went before and arose [228] from a refusal to go to the root of the problem and pull back from a misuse of constitutional law. The new subsections seek not only to roll back the Supreme Court decision but to roll back the meaning of Article 40. 3.3º itself on women's equal right to life. It will open the door to even more litigation and fail to deal openly and honestly with the real and continuous problems of Irish women. The Constitution should not be used to superimpose a dogmatic principle on the health of women. What is being done here is an insult to the integrity of women. Some of the words which are used in these Bills are unique in this situation. The term 'it shall be unlawful' appears nowhere else in the Constitution except in the proposed wording of this Amendment. The distinction between the life and health of the mother is unique not only in our Constitution but, I would suggest, in legislative provisions elsewhere. I take up the point raised by Deputy De Rossa this morning in connection with the way the ballot paper is to be titled. It is proposed that the ballot papers will be in different colours and that each will have a separate title. The ballot paper dealing with what is known as the substantive issue will be entitled 'Right to Life'. It is an extraordinary decision to use that title since that term does not appear in the text of the proposed change to the Constitution. The introduction of a title to the ballot paper, which will require an amendment to the 1963 Electoral Act, is an underhand attempt by the Government to introduce a bias in the ballot paper itself. It is a form of political cuteness that should have no place in this entire issue. There is general acceptance that the issue of abortion is politically sensitive because many people in our society hold different but genuine and deeply held views about it. Those views should be respected. What I think we are getting here is an attempt to sacrifice the health of women on the high altar of political cuteness. It is, I submit, politically cute to title the ballot paper in a way which introduces a form of bias into the referendum process. [229] Political cuteness is not entirely confined to the Government benches on this issue. For several weeks I have been hearing people on all sides of the political divide stating that they want this issue dealt with by way of legislation, but I have heard very little about what would be in that legislation. It is time for people who have been calling for legislation on this issue to state what they propose should be in that legislation. It is time for this House, for politicians and people outside this House to stop being politically cute on the question of the health of women.;2626666

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Ms. Mary Harney;Fianna Fáil;If there were more women in this House we would obviously make a bigger impact. We have 13 women but, unfortunately, as 13 women we do not seem to matter when it comes to dealing with issues of this kind. I believe that around this country the approach being adopted on this issue is not widely supported, even by those who do not wish to see abortion in Ireland. Most people realise that it is not a political issue, should not be dealt with in a political way and that nobody wins votes on this kind of issue. People see it for the personalised, difficult issue that it is. It is a moral issue and one that personally affects people in a very special way. It is only when people are affected or know of somebody who is personally affected that they begin to think out the issue for themselves. Many people do not even want to have to think about it. I believe we have let women down but we have also let ourselves down and we have let society down. That brings me to the question of the vote. I am one of the few people in this House who on one occasion actually [190] voted against my party and I did so because I felt very strongly about the issue that was involved. I did not do it lightly and it is not an easy thing to do. Obviously, as someone who is very concerned about this issue, I contemplated doing the same on this occasion and I asked myself what would be the consequences of doing that. Would it do any good? Would it cause a general election? It is not that I do not think the issue is not important enough because I believe it is, it is important for women and for the kind of society we are, but I believe an election on this issue would be extremely divisive, it would turn back the clock, to use a well quoted phrase and it would achieve nothing. It would be an abortion election and people would be branded as abortionists if they wanted to provide a sympathetic and caring response in particular circumstances. For that reason in particular, and because no good could be achieved, I do not believe it is the kind of issue in which people should vote against the approach being adopted by the Government. The consequences of doing so obviously is a general election. That might suit some people perhaps that is what some people would like. Some people are cynical enough to want to win votes on the issue of abortion, which affects families and women in a special way. It is a shame in 1992 that we are still approaching these issues in the way we are. It is a shame that we do not have proper family planning, proper pregnancy counselling or any research on the women who go to Britain for abortion. We live in a country where only two weeks ago somebody who was convicted of raping an 18-month-old stepsister was given a suspended sentence. What kind of society is that? We need to make many changes. We need to get more women in key, decision-making positions and we need more women in Cabinet. I am very proud of the role that my two party colleagues played in Cabinet. Both tried very hard, the Leader of my party, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at the Cabinet sub-committee and both my colleagues in Cabinet. I regret [191] they were not successful. A mistake was made. We made a mistake in 1983 and we are making another one now. It is only a question of when the issue will be before the courts again and we will be expecting them to make a decision for us. The Supreme Court let this House off the hook last February by allowing that girl to go to Britain. The irony is that if they had prevented her from going this issue would probably have been properly sorted out last March. We probably would have had a referendum on travel and information and we would not be dealing with what is called the substantive issue. There was a great sigh of relief everywhere when they made the decision to let that girl go. I detect among members of all parties no great interest in getting involved in this campaign. Politicians want to stay out of it. They were sickened the last time and they do not want a repeat of what happened then. In the last campaign there was division in almost every group in society — teachers for and teachers against, doctors for and doctors against, the handicapped for and the handicapped against. It was bad for the country and it was bad for politics. The road we are travelling now is equally bad for the country and bad for politics. That is why I hope many politicians will adopt a sensible approach, unlike the approach adopted on the last occasion. I appeal to those politicians who take a different view from those of us who want to deal sympathetically with rape and incest victims, and with those who we could commit suicide and whose health and life was at risk, not to brand us abortionists. We are not abortionists. We are trying to become passionate and caring people, understanding the very difficult plight in which so many women, particularly young women, find themselves. We recognise the real possibility of people committing suicide. That is why our psychiatric institutions have so many patients who have been committed against their will. They have been sent in because they are a danger to themselves. [192] For an under-age girl who has been the victim of rape or incest there is a real possibility that she will commit suicide. The Supreme Court has been lauded in this House. The words of Mr. Justice Finlay are the words which will be put before the people in the referendum, yet we are trying to restrict in this referendum the good decision made by Mr. Justice Finlay and the other judges. On the one hand we are praising his words and using them as giving authoritative guidance in this area, but on the other hand we are trying to restict the consequences of the decision made by the Supreme Court. I do not see the logic in that approach. Voting as I intend will be a very painful and difficult thing for me to do. I do not say that lightly. I regret very much that we are placed in this position and that it is a choice between an election or voting this way. That is not the way a modern parliament in a developed country should approach this issue. I long for the day when these kind of moral issues will be the subject of a free vote in all parties. That will be good for democracy and good for politics and it will be particularly good for those in all parties who often find themselves having to vote in away they would not wish. We should not be afraid to allow people freely to express their conscientious view in a vote of this kind.;2626668

914;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Ms. Mary Flaherty;Fine Gael;I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this very important debate and to indicate my support for the Bills on the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution and my very deep concern about the implications contained in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. I will confine most of my remarks to the Twelfth Amendment because I am extremely concerned that this removes [193] the Supreme Court protection of the lives of women. Women in Ireland stand protected by the Supreme Court decision in the X case which clearly states that a woman's life is protected in all cases of real risk. Unbelievably, if the substantive amendment is passed by this House and then by the country, that clear protection will be diminished in two substantial ways. In March this year I awaited with anxiety the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court. I remember leaving Leinster House and being accosted by a journalist who had the information that the Supreme Court had decided, on the basis of the right to life of the woman, that the young victim in the X case could travel and have an abortion. Apart from sharing the general feeling of relief that her tragedy was being resolved to the degree that she and her family considered appropriate or possible, I also felt a general sense of relief, perhaps because of the threat of which I was not overly conscious. I felt very clearly a general threat to women and I welcomed the Supreme Court's statement that where the lives of women, particularly women of child bearing age, were at risk, their lives would be protected by the State. I had three pregnancies in the previous nine years so it was a very real reassurance for me and one which I would not lightly let go. I watched with interest political developments following that decision and the effects to reach consensus. I hoped that consensus could be reached between all the parties. We waited throughout the summer, following the first series of meetings with the leadership, for the proposals of the Government. When they emerged in the past few weeks I was particularly concerned that the amendments proposed by the Government rowed back so far the protection given to women as a result of the Supreme Court decision. The extraordinarily inept frightening inclusion of the qualification regarding a woman's health thrust ambiguity and uncertainty back into the area of medical treatment. The Minister would like us to believe that [194] this is not so, but speaker after speaker inside and outside the House has reiterated that view. We must remember that pro-life groups will be policing this change if it comes about. They reassured us in 1983 that certain things would not happen, that young women would not be stopped from travelling abroad and that books would not be removed from our libraries. We have learned that the worst scenarios do become reality. The Minister has tried to reassure us. I find his reassurances as hollow and worthless as in 1983. It is incomprehensible that the Fianna Fáil Party — and they stand on their own in this — can with such certainty recommend a wording when on all sides of this House and outside voices are raised, including the voices of their partners in Government, questioning seriously the consequences of the approach they are suggesting. I am saddened that some Fianna Fáil women have paraded in this House to defend the indefensible. I listened with dismay, with some anger and with a great sense of disappointment this morning to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, who disparaged the contribution of our spokesman, Deputy Shatter, who, last night, spoke very courageously and lucidly about the possible consequences of the wording proposed. The same Deputies, and, indeed, perhaps Deputies O'Malley and Harney, who were part of the Government in 1983, disparaged then the arguments put up by the Deputy they are disparaging today, but every one of his arguments proved to be right. Deputies would do a great deal more justice to Deputy Shatter by listening to his contributions. The Minister this morning also questioned the description of the substantive issue. It is a very substantive issue — a matter of life and death — I am concerned that she could be so certain that future life threatening experiences will not be more difficult to resolve as a result of this amendment. The Minister for Justice, in his speech yesterday, was full of contradictions and [195] inconsistencies. In referring to the Supreme Court judgment he said that the effect of it was: to permit termination of pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by such termination and that a risk of self-destruction may constitute a real and substantial risk. The earlier part is doing all the Minister seeks to achieve. In his reference to the Supreme Court decision he says that it achieves all he sets out to achieve in his amendment. It already allows interventions to protect the life of the woman but not protect the health of the woman. Why fix it, if it is not wrong? The words suggested make a difficult situation worse. I and many of my colleagues in the House know how difficult it has been for women to get the kind of treatment they need on occasions under existing law. There is no doubt that the Minister's proposal worsens the situation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, in his speech said that the distinction to be drawn in the Constitution between life and health is another major concern which would take away from doctors, from the country and from the House any right to deal with hard cases which will arise. The Minister referred to there being a spectrum of concern, a spectrum of gravity at the point where the danger moves from one of health to one of life and he said that his concern had been expressed to him by doctors. The Minister dismissed all that and reassured doctors that they will be able to do all they want. An eminent obstetrician in this country told me of a case which occurred under the old wording in which a woman with cancer of the uterus presented to a rural obstetrician who identified that she would need an operation and he then consulted his lawyer to see how he stood in relation to the existing pro-life amendment to the Constitution. He was advised that he had serious difficulties and did not provide the treatment for the woman. [196] The woman then went to Britain and had an abortion and came back and had her treatment. However, we do not know what further risk there was to her life in having an abortion which was not directly related to the treatment or what impact that had on the progress of her disease or on whether it might have presented a very real risk to her life. These areas are extremely difficult as they are. Inserting the additional amendment adds confusion. I would urge that it be removed. The amendment should be withdrawn and put aside or at least postponed. The other major amendment to the Supreme Court decision is the elimination of the possibility of medical intervention in the case of suicide. I accept that the reasons given for this amendment are more substantial, in the context that none of us wishes to see anything done which would treat life lightly and we wish to the maximum reasonable extent possible to protect the life of the unborn and create a society that values, cherishes and protects life. That is the kind of society I wish to create, but it does not mean that I have to turn my back on very real situations. If we accept the Minister's proposal we will have turned our backs on the X case which led to all of this. We have also turned our backs on not just one Lovett sister but on two Lovett sisters. The hard cases of which the Minister talked have occurred. In the early part of his speech in relation to the entitlement of women to have medical intervention when necessary, he said: If there were to be only one case in one million, or even ten or more million, we would have to take account of it. I welcomed that affirmation of life but the theme did not remain central to the Minister's contribution. There were very serious contradictions in the case put forward by the Minister yesterday. In the past few years we have had public cases amounting to more than one in a million. How could the Minister say that, and then turn his back on the consequences of confusion as a result, due to doctors having to make sure that they only [197] treated women at the point where gravity had moved to life threatening rather than life shortening. It is asking too much and doctors will inevitably err on the side of being cautious. The Minister now seems to believe that this general right to life excludes women dying from delayed medical treatment or suicide, and therefore the general concern which the Minister expressed at the beginning of his speech and which most of us welcomed rings very hollow indeed. Having listened to the outline of the PD position on the issue I do not want to make political capital as they are obviously finding this very difficult. One has to admire the frankness with which Deputy Harney has shown how difficult they find this but I do not know how they can stand over the extraordinary political gyrations when they can identify such fundamental flaws in the proposed amendments. I cannot understand how they can risk the passage of such unsafe wording by putting such a flawed wording to the public. Deputy O'Malley was part of the Government responsible for the amendment in 1983 and I welcome the fact that on this occasion, unlike the Minister, he has learned that this area is one where there can be no absolutes. This is a fundamentally complex area where there are two interconnected lives, it is never going to be simple and it is uniquely female. Anybody who tries to ascribe certainties to it is not learning from previous mistakes and is playing the most serious games with the lives of women. I share the view of Minister Harney that the appropriate way to deal with this is to forget this amendment and proceed with the amendments on travel and information on which there is substantial agreement in this House. We should then look to see how we can make this a genuinely pro-life society. We must look to see why, with our high moral tone, with our strong commitment to religion we still have such large numbers of women of all ages going abroad to seek abortions. We must see what we can do to change that and support women in such crises so that more of them can carry on [198] with their pregnancies. That would be far more valuable work. While there is a variety of views in Fine Gael, we all believe that this amendment is so flawed that some say it should be postponed, many others say that it should be dropped, and that we should proceed with legislation alone or legislation prior to a referendum as a far more appropriate way of dealing with this complex issue. I urge the Government to consider these appeals. The view on all sides of the House, including the Government side is that their approach to the Twelfth Amendment is completly wrong, that they should seriously think again and withdraw the current proposal.;2626672

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Mrs. Madeleine Taylor-Quinn;Fine Gael;The Taoiseach sought consensus among the Opposition parties on this side of the House but that was just a charade, an attempt to convince the public that he was serious about the matter. However, the public are not convinced of this. It was nothing but a bogus exercise on the part of the Taoiseach. The referendum of 1983 was not just a pro-life referendum. As we realised in the following years it was about frightening and controlling women. The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution that is before the House this week is similar to the 1983 Amendment. That Amendment was anti-women in its origin and its implementation and the wording of the Twelfth Amendment is also profoundly anti-women. It is unfortunate that the Government are not prepared to examine in detail the circumstances in which pregnant women should be treated medically. None of these issues has been argued in detail. I was particularly disappointed with the contribution of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and I am very concerned at some of the statements she made. She said that the concerns of women mirror the concerns of doctors and that the Amendment is not seeking from doctors a greater degree of certainty about the risk to a mother's life before providing treatment. She went on to say that pregnant women will receive all treatment necessary to protect their health. At no stage has a Government Minister outlined in detail how treatment will be provided, in what circumstances it will be provided and who will make the decisions. There are many questions in relation to that aspect that have not been elaborated on in this House. The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications said that if the words 'as distinct from the health' were [245] omitted from the proposed Amendment, any future hard case which is not related to a life-threatening condition could be the ground for abortion. That is scaremongering. The Minister did not elaborate on this matter. She mentioned the Bourne case of 1938, but she failed to say that no legislation was introduced in Britain subsequent to that case. When they attempted to introduce legislation in 1968, 30 years later, the whole question of abortion had blown up in England. The Minister went on to say that a pregnancy may be terminated if doctors form the view that even after recovering from childbirth other treatment for whatever illness the mother was suffering from during the pregnancy would be ineffective to save her life. I would ask the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs who is present in the House, what direction is being given to the medical profession in taking these decisions? Is it not true that medical practitioners will find themselves in a serious dilemma as regards the course of action to take in particular instances? For example, if a pregnant women is suffering from breast cancer it has been stated that she will receive the treatment she requires. We all know that a variety of treatments may be provided for breast cancer, some more effective than others. For instance, some doses of chemotherapy and radium treatment are more effective than others, and doctors will have to decide the strength of treatment to be applied. In this regard a serious question arises in relation to the life of the woman. Cancer is life-threatening, but it could also be regarded as a danger to health. Therefore on one hand a decision will have to be made in relation to the health of the woman while on the other hand a decision will have to be made in relation to her life. We must remember that the life we live is determined by the health we enjoy, and in certain instances it will be impossible for a medical practitioner to make a decision. The Government have a responsibility to examine in detail those instances and to set down in legislation guidelines for medical practitioners [246] as to how they should act in those circumstances. There are women who are concerned and confused about this matter and they do not know whether to vote for or against the wording of the amendments. They are particularly concerned at the statement by the Taoiseach that if the wording in the Twelfth Amendment is not carried he will bring in legislation based on the X case. Such a statement is highly irresponsible and emotional and is scaremongering. The Taoiseach has a responsibility to introduce legislation that will be determined in detail by the House. Debate adjourned.;2626674
917;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Andrew Boylan;Fine Gael;I welcome the opportunity to make a very brief statement on this legislation. I am totally opposed to holding a referendum especially at this time. I am opposed to it on the grounds that this is being rushed through the Dáil as can be seen by the number of Deputies on my side of the House who are anxious to make a contribution. They have a perfect right to do so and to be given ample time to put their point of view, but they are not being given that opportunity. I am opposed to the manner in which this is being foisted on the people and the manner in which it has been presented. They are not being given a clear choice about whether they are for abortion or not. The proposal being put before the people is a choice between limited and liberal abortion. That is an insult to people who are totally opposed to this and who have a perfect right to that viewpoint. I am opposed to abortion in any shape or form. It is wrong and cannot be condoned. There must be something radically wrong in a society where 4,000 women and young girls found it necessary last year to leave this country for an abortion. A pregnancy outside marriage can happen in any family. It can happen quite naturally when a couple are keeping company. That is when the family's strength counts and that girl is supported by the family through that difficult circumstance. Obviously people are [199] reneging on their responsibilities to educate and advise young people. Far be it from me to preach or lay down any doctrine but I think the Churches, all of them, have been sadly lacking in their duty in that regard. There is a trend towards social liberation in this country now as witnessed on our television screens every night at an early hour when young people are watching. Young people believe that this is the way of life. They get into these difficulties and then they are abandoned. It is sad, but abortion is not the solution. That only adds to the problems. Abortion is not the way to deal with the problem. If abortion is wrong in this country it is wrong outside it. In that regard, I take on board the contributions of the Progressive Democrats. I am amazed that they are being browbeaten into standing behind the Government with regard to these proposals. Deputy Quill stated at the weekend that she will be voting No on this issue in her polling booth in Cork. I say to Deputy Quill that if it is wrong in Cork it is wrong in Leinster House and let her come and explain that to the people in this country. I am also annoyed at the Government's attitude to this referendum which is only being put to the people to create confusion and distract them from other issues that are affecting people and causing the effects that led to the need for this referendum. I mean the loss of jobs, the problems young couples have meeting their commitments and the problems of families with children in third level education who cannot come up with the necessary finance to support them. These young people are at third level institutions with hardly any money in their pockets, hardly enough to pay for their digs and their upkeep. This can only lead to difficulties. I must also ask the Minister of State why this referendum is being held on a Thursday. Why not give the young people who will have to live with this legislation an opportunity of saying Yes or No to these proposals? Many of them will be at third level institutions away [200] from their homes and will not be able to travel home between the hours of 9 a. m. and 9 p. m. Why is the referendum not being held on a Friday, or preferably on a Saturday, when all those young people will be at home in their constituencies and able to give their opinion through the ballot box as they are entitled to do? They are being denied that opportunity. They are being denied it for some particular reason that Fianna Fáil are afraid of. It is wrong. That is not democracy in operation. It is not too late yet. Everybody is opposed to 3 December as being too soon. Let it be left over until the spring and choose a date at a weekend when those young people are at home. It may be all right for me to pronounce on it. My time rearing a family is over, thank God. The people who will be pronouncing on this will not be personally affected. They will be legislating on something that will affect coming generations and young people are not being given an opportunity to have a say. There are a number of flaws in this. I do not want to take from the time of Deputies Belton and Harte so I will conclude by saying that this is wrong, that it is not too late to step back. It is doing untold damage. I am saying to my supporters and the people who come to me that they should vote No on this issue, rebuke the Government and show them for what they are trying to do. This referendum is an insult to the intelligence of the people. It is not acceptable and we as an elected body must reject it if we are to show any example to the people out there who are obviously looking for leadership.;2626675

924;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Louis Belton;Fine Gael;This referendum was proposed as a result of the X case. Up to that time quite a few politicians in this House were satisfied with the Constitution as it stood. Listening to the Progressive Democrats speak about the difficult situation they now find themselves in, I wonder do they think about the difficult situation in which politicians found themselves in 1983. I was not there at that time but I have heard that politicians in this House were branded as [201] being soft on abortion. As a result of all that, Fianna Fáil now find themselves in a very awkward political situation. They were very certain in 1983 and were very accommodating to groups that they thought would be of political benefit to them. Now they find themselves in Government and, as a result of the Supreme Court ruling in a very difficult situation. They had no choice but to put this issue forward out of political expedience, just as they have done in the past. My party have advocated that more time be made available to discuss the substantive issue. I do not think anyone would quarrel with the suggestion that there should be the right to travel and that provision should be made for this in the Constitution of any civilised society or democracy. I also welcome the amendment dealing with the right to information. It would be a step in the right direction if a woman who finds herself in stressful circumstances or in a crisis could avail of an opportunity to have consultations and receive advice. Some people dread what this referendum could mean in relation to the health of a woman. Women are entitled to feel this way. Indeed, I would feel the same way if a provision was to be written into the Constitution which would dictate what should be done in relation to my health in a given situation. I believe the Government have been too political, too slap-dash and in too much of a hurry to get the issue out of the way. We cannot deal with these matters in that way because there is too much at stake — women's health and the wellbeing of society.;2626682

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Paddy Harte;Fine Gael;Everything that has to be said in this debate has been said at this stage. However I would like to ask the Government, quo vadis, where they are going. In 1983, when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they had all the answers and they made life hell for Deputies like myself who were conscientiously trying to find a solution to prevent abortions being carried out on the island of Ireland. Unless people lined up with those who had lost their heads and had become [202] highly emotional in some way they were considered suspect. I should say that the Fine Gael Party which I was born into, which I supported as a young man and have spent half my life serving as a Dail Deputy are not now, never have been and never will be an abortionist party. I have absolute confidence in the present leadership and membership of the party that I have the honour to represent. This debate is not about who is in favour of abortion. I recognise that members of the Fianna Fáil Party are as anti-abortion as I am and that the same is true of members of other parties in this House. What we are trying to do is prevent abortions being carried out in this country because abortion is wrong and cannot be defended. It is not right to take the life of an unborn that is wrong in all its forms. However it is equally wrong that a mother should die because her only crime was to have become pregnant. It makes little or no difference whether that woman is the mother of a young family or a teenager if her life is threatened and that is the dilemma we are faced with. How do we find laws to protect a woman in that situation? The argument that is being made outside the House and which has influenced the Fianna Fáil Party, but not the other parties, is that the best way to deal with this matter is to hold a referendum. There appears to be an argument, however, over whether we are right to proceed by way of a referendum rather than by way of legislation in this House. During the past few months I have had many friendly conversations with people who hold the view that the abortion issue has to be settled by way of referendum. I could only conclude, however, that they were so obsessed with the argument as to whether the matter should be dealt with by way of a referendum rather than by way of legislation that they lost sight of the real issue. Let us consider not what may happen in the future but what happened in the past. In 1861, the Offences Against the Persons Act was introduced in Westminster. This was the law which prohibited abortion on the island of Ireland and it is [203] still on our Statute Book. For some reason or other there were people in 1983 who got the idea that a referendum should be held to copperfasten the position and they were not prepared to trust the people they had elected to Dáil Éireann. In 1861, Westminster was anything but Catholic and was certainly not influenced by Irish thinking but it had Christians of denominations other then Roman Catholic who found a wording that would prohibit abortion for 130 years on the island of Ireland or, as happened, until the law was called into question as a result of the wording of the 1983 referendum. The Supreme Court passed its judgment on that wording in the context of the X case and it now seems that it made the wrong judgment rather than that the people made the wrong law. I have heard some of the finest speeches that I have heard in my 30 odd years in this House during the course of this debate. I congratulate the members of my own party who have spoken and, I congratulate Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Harney in particular. I would also like to congratulate Deputy Howlin of the Labour Party and Deputy De Rossa, Leader of Democratic Left. While I would not agree with everything they said it is clear that they had given deep thought to this issue and were sincere and sympathetic. I am sure there are many in Fianna Fáil who could articulate the same thoughts and feelings but for some reason they have refrained from doing so because they are more influenced by popular opinion and by extremists who believe that the answer lies only in a referendum. There is no talk in the North of Ireland about abortion: the law that was enacted in Westminster in 1861 is still on the Statute Book in that part of the island. Neither was there any talk about abortion here until 1983 but since then everything has gone wrong. I am sure that some lawyer in the future will drill holes in the proposed amendments to the Constitution. Let me ask a few pertinent questions. What kind of society would we have if [204] Great Britain decided that abortion should only be available to citizens of Great Britain? What kind of society would we have if the 5,000 young women who go to Great Britain each year for abortions wanted to have abortions here? How would we cope with such a problem? My own view as I have stated already is that abortion is wrong. Long before it became a major issue of debate on this part of the island I counselled a young woman who was pregnant and talking of abortion. Having advised her that abortion was wrong I suggested that she see her doctor. After speaking to her doctor she went to a nursing home in Belfast and had her baby which was adopted. Everything was done as all of us would have wished. However, I often wondered how I would have felt if that girl had died as a result of continuing with her pregnancy, having taken the advice of the doctor and myself. What right have I to tell a girl she should not have an abortion? If a young pregnant lady comes to me I will counsel against abortion and advise her to see her obstetrician. If she still has a problem she should consult her spiritual director and then make up her mind in the privacy of her home. At that stage it is not my business or that of anybody else other than the members of her family, and if the decision taken is the wrong one it is they who will have to answer for it. On 5 January 1973 we had a referendum to remove from the Constitution the privileged position of the Catholic Church. This was recommended by Cardinal William Conway and the entire Catholic Hierarchy. It was also recommended by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and by the leaders of every political party. I would like to ask a very sobering question, have we really removed from our Constitution the privileged position of the Catholic Church? Have we really got it out of our system? If Irish unity is our ultimate desire, if we want to create a society in which all Irish people — Catholic, Protestant and dissenters — have equal citizenship, we must abide by civil laws. [205] On many occasions I have listened to debates on radio and television and read statements in the press by well-intentioned people, including the clergy, who are continually confused as between the moral law and the civil law on abortion. Morally abortion is wrong, and I do not believe that my thinking in that regard will change. However, the civil law must also be taken into account. Regardless of the laws of the country in which I live, be it England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, the USA or any part of Europe, my moral thinking will not change. The clergy and people in high positions in the pro-life movement have unfortunately confused moral thinking on abortion with civil law, which is the responsibility of legislators. We have an obligation to prevent abortion on demand. I am convinced by the arguments in favour of legislation. As Deputy Lenihan will appreciate, if Members from different parties disagree on any matter, the longer we talk about it the better chance there is of finding a solution. That does not happen when people are asked to make a decision by way of referendum. No matter what the issue, a referendum is divisive. Politicians are inclined to listen to the strongest lobby and to find the answers to placate that lobby. They decide what is the safest way to travel. As well as being divisive, referenda can be very emotional, and in divisive and emotional situations the right answers can never be found. Usually you end up destroying the very thing you set out to protect. Deputy Lenihan knows that what I am saying is true, that the proper way to handle this matter is by way of legislation. The proper way to proceed is to say to everyone who wants to prevent abortion let us all row in the one direction let us stop the argument as to whether a referendum is the right way of dealing with the issue or whether it should be dealt with by way of legislation. That should not be the point of the argument. The real issue is how we introduce or strengthen laws that will prevent abortion on demand. The Government is not facing that challenge. Unfortunately the courageous speeches to which I have [206] referred are not being matched by courageous speeches from Fianna Fáil Deputies. Fianna Fáil had all the answers in 1983. We could say to them now, you made life hell for us in 1983 you did everything but throw the kitchen sink at us and you did so to placate a popular vote, purely for political expediency. We could accuse the Government of all those things and make life hell for them, but we are trying to be responsible. The Government should listen to the voice of reason and postpone this referendum. It will be divisive and will not solve the problem. At the end of the day common sense should prevail and we could then face the challenge by bringing in proper and strong legislation. Between 1861 and 1992 — for 131 years — it was believed that abortion was illegal here. However, we had the 1983 referendum and abortion became legal in 1992. We talk about the privileged position of the Catholic Church, the ethos of the Catholic Church and the people in the pro-life movement — I do not say this in a critical way — who are all prominent, good living, Catholic people, but it is strange that laws introduced by a parliament that was not Catholic or Irish, which kept abortion off the streets of Dublin and out of Irish society for 131 years, were changed by a Catholic Parliament and a Catholic people. The referendum was held to prevent abortion but we destroyed what we set out to protect. That was a strange conclusion, but I suppose fact is stranger than fiction. In a final plea to the Government I would ask them to listen to the voice of reason from the Opposition benches and proceed by way of legislation rather than referendum. We will then explain the decision to those people who desire a referendum rather than legislation.;2626685

935;An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Dr. James McDaid;Fianna Fáil;I wish to refer briefly to the Twelfth Amendment Bill. I have been concerned about various aspects of the substantive issue during the past few months and I have written about these concerns on two or three occasions. Like most Members, the last thing I want to see here is the type of widescale abortion which has become so common in other countries. It disturbs me, and I abhor the carrying out of abortions for no better reason than as a method of birth control, especially at a time when thousands of childless couples find it impossible to find a child for adoption. I have also referred to the awful dilemma we find ourselves in when, in very rare cases, a woman is virtually sentenced to death as a result of her pregnancy. I mentioned a list of possible conditions which could give rise to this situation, even though it is acknowledged that medical science can deal adequately with the great majority of these cases. There is always the exceptional case and I cannot understand how eminent professional colleagues of mine can say that these exceptional cases cannot arise, that no woman will ever be faced with such a dilemma, that they can be 100 per cent sure that this will not arise. Those who make such statements are acting as gods. My recent article in The Irish Times has been quoted in this House. In it I said that even if there was only one exceptional case in ten years or more we would be very wrong to have a total ban in the Constitution against any procedures which would save that woman's life. The real purpose of any debate is to listen to a variety of views and to be prepared to act accordingly if necessary. Many of the fears I expressed have been allayed in recent days by the Ministers for Justice and Health. I congratulate [238] them on the attitude they have adopted to this highly emotive and complex issue. I am heartened by the fact that the Minister referred specifically to many of the fears which I, among others, expressed and he has convinced me that they have been taken into account. I am not a legal person but the Minister obviously has had the benefit of the best expertise available. The explanatory document given to the leaders of the Opposition parties was drawn up by professional people, legal and probably, medical people, and I had no problem with the interpretation in that document. Some confusion appears to have arisen with regard to the interpretation of the interpretation. However, I would be less than honest if I did not say that I am still worried about the insertion of the words 'as distinct from health'. The Minister acknowledges that these words may give offence to many women but clearly he has been advised that to omit them might leave the way open to a more liberal approach to abortion. If this were proven to be inevitable then I could understand his concern. However, he states that the risk to life need not be immediate. There seems to be a contradiction here. If this is the case, why insert the words 'as distinct from health'? I have always been under the impression, as a medical man, that health is the determining factor where life is concerned. The Minister referred to the experience in Great Britain and elsewhere. The difference is that these countries do not have a written constitution which sets limits on what Parliament can do. If some people are afraid that the omission of a reference to health may lead to spurious decisions being made by some doctors who see nothing wrong with an extreme liberal view, surely these fears are adequately dealt with by the main wording in the amendment. Such doctors would be dealt with appropriately by the medical council, not to mention by the courts. I have also mentioned that for the guidance of doctors certain legislation may be necessary. The Minister said: [239] The question has also been raised whether legislation should be introduced which would supplement the amendment if passed. It seems to me that the test proposed in the amendment is a straightforward one based on whether or not termination of pregnancy is necessary to save the life of the mother and should not give rise to difficulty in practice. The Minister also said: The proposed amendment does not disturb or change the finding in any way and does not require an immediate risk to life. Many examples have been given in this House and quite a number of anatomical lessons have perhaps been learned. Let me give one example of a 45 year old woman who has had quite a number of children, who is hypertensive or who has angina. If that person did not want to go ahead with the pregnancy and was able to find some 'rogue' doctor, for want of a better word, could it not be said that he could accommodate her on the basis that the wording does not require an immediate risk to life? If that woman were to die within two to three years would her parents and relatives not have the right to say to me, if I refused to perform the termination, that she would still be alive if I had agreed to the termination? That could form the basis of a Y case. It is for this reason that I believe that there are not enough words in the Oxford English Dictionary capable of being inserted in the Constitution to satisfy everybody in this instance. I also believe, given that medical guidelines are required, that subsequent legislation, in addition to the amendment, may be required and I am heartened by the fact that the Minister stated in his speech in that same paragraph: 'we will of course listen carefully to any views expressed on this matter during the course of this debate.' Last weekend I said that I was concerned about the decision to publish the outlines of the legislation that would be necessary in the event of the amendment [240] not being passed. I made a point of discussing this matter with the Taoiseach and as a result of this conversation and on hearing the Minister's speech I am now satisfied that it would have been irresponsible of the Government, were the occasion to arise, to thrust this legislation on the people without prior warning at this stage of the debate. The Taoiseach is right when he states that society at this time is not prepared to tolerate either of the two extremes in this case and he is to be commended for insisting that the constitutional imperative of a mother's right to life must be borne in mind at all times. It goes without saying no matter what procedure is adopted in medical practice that every effort must be made to save the lives of both mother and child. This is by far the most complex issue to come before the House in a long time. Not one of us can claim to have all the right answers. Conflicting arguments are being made from all sides but at the end of the day the Government must act with commonsense and realism. The Taoiseach has kept his word by bringing in these referenda within the timescale that he promised. I trust therefore that as a result we may arrive at the most sensible decisions possible.;2626693

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Brian (Snr.) Lenihan;Fianna Fáil;The amendment dealing [207] with the right to travel reiterates a basic human right and the wording puts this matter beyond any about which may have arisen because of the Supreme Court decision in the X case. The amendment relating to freedom of information on services lawfully available in another State is another freedom which can be regulated by domestic law. For these reasons this House — and the people — should not have any difficulty in approving Amendments Nos. 13 and 14. The real debate arises on Amendment No. 12 which proposes to amend Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution which guarantees an equality of life to the unborn child and the mother. Amendment No. 12 is designed to make lawful the termination of pregnancy 'where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction'. As the Minister for Justice said yesterday: 'the only acceptable test is whether the action is necessary to save the life of the mother'. This is a clear, straightforward proposition, which should be written into the Constitution in plain, unambiguous terms. I support the Government on the principle of putting it into the Constitution rather than engaging in the tortuous exercise of complex legislation. I also agree with the exclusion of the risk of self-destruction because of the obvious abuse of this threat being widely used as an excuse for abortion. In the X case, with which we are all familiar, the Supreme Court could, on the evidence, have found in favour of the appellant on the basis of the right to travel without getting into the straitjacket of stretching the evidence to give judgment on the basis of threatened suicide. I cannot understand why the Supreme Court did not make their decision solely on the basis of the right to travel to date I have not heard a satisfactory explanation as to why they did not find on that simple basis, which would have avoided the arguments since then. Commonsense should be the currency of law makers like ourselves seeking to ask the people to incorporate a practical [208] principle into their Constitution. We are really talking about the risk to the life of the mother and the only people who can decide that matter are the medical practitioners in the particular case, on its merits, and in the circumstances of each situation as it presents itself to the medical practitioner involved. That is the way it has always worked, the way it works now and the way, I hope, it will always work. It is also a fact of life that variations in regard to illness and disorder arising from a pregnancy are infinite and personal to each case. The risks are relative and differ in nature and scale from person to person and from day to day. There are not any absolutes and it is wrong to import absolute judgments into this area. The only real absolute — if you want to use one — is the application of high integrity and compassion by the medical profession in dealing with each individual case, on which we are reliant. We have always relied on the medical practitioner's adherence to a principled and compassionate approach and that is the way it should be in future. We are politicians, not theologians or medical experts. In this amendment, having established the humane principle of termination of pregnancy on risk to the life of the mother, we should then leave the matter to be decided by the doctors within the framework of medical ethics. For this reason — I hope I have explained my position — I have grave doubts about the inclusion in the Amendment of the five words: 'as distinct from the health' because it sets up a contra distinction between health and life which is confusing to lawyers and doctors and unworthy as far as women are concerned. The words do not serve any useful purpose and are superfluous in the Amendment which is concerned only with risk to life. It adds an unnecessary and confusing dimension to an otherwise almost perfect wording. The contra distinction between health and life is already causing bewilderment to doctors who will have to interpret it, sometimes in emergencies and in an environment which is becoming increasingly litigious as far as the medical profession [209] are concerned. One has only to think about it for a few minutes to appreciate the incongruities, contradictions and paradoxes. What is the difference between life and health? Life is health and health is life. Where is the line between one and the other? Where does the risk to health end and the risk to life begin? In any medical condition there is a spectrum of gravity and it is impossible to identify a precise point at which the risk changes from a risk to health to a risk to life. In situations of that kind one must rely on the integrity, compassion and professionalism of the the medical practitioners involved in the case. I agree with the medical opinion which has been expressed by eminent medical people in recent days that the inclusion of the phrase 'as distinct from the health' could have the effect of restricting a certain flexibility which exists under current medical practice where doctors are permitted to exercise it in the best interests of their patients. Potentially, this phrase 'as distinct from the health' could result in a regression from the present medical practice in regard to the treatment of women in pregnancy. I am sure that nobody in this House wants that to happen. In the general debate loose phrases like 'direct' or 'indirect abortion' have been used and there have been questions in relation to whether termination is intentional or unintentional, advertent or inadvertent. However, none of these phrases is consistent as they mean various things to different people. None of those phrases mean anything in law or in fact. They are meaningless also in a constitutional sense, yet they are being tossed around by various people in this debate like snuff at a wake. The only reality in the whole issue is the risk to the life of the mother. Where that is endangered the amendment proposes in a general sense that the pregnancy can be terminated. The phraseology should be kept simple and addressed just to that reality. We propose to permit termination in circumstances in which there is a risk to life. The medical profession on medical criteria should be [210] the sole judges, in consultation with the mother, as to whether a termination should take place on that basis. That does not make the issue complicated for us as legislators. It enables us to put a straightforward, unambiguous amendment to the people in a referendum. Under the amendment we seek to deal in a humane way with the risk to the life of the mother and allow for a termination in those circumstances if it is so decided by the doctor. That is simplicity itself. It will be completely understood by the people and, in my view, it will secure an overwhelming majority. I therefore suggest to the Minister that at the conclusion of the passage of the Bill he consider the deletion from the amendment before the House of the five words I have mentioned, 'as distinct from the health'. I am supporting the Amendment in principle. I agree with the principle involved in the holding of a referendum but I would much prefer a clear and more concise formulation that is only concerned with the risk to life and the assessment of that risk by the medical profession.;2626697

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Ms. Síle de Valera;Fianna Fáil;When the referendum on the right to travel and information was first mooted it was my hope that we would also have a referendum on the substantive issue. I am therefore supportive of the Government's action. I have had the opportunity to have a number of discussions with the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General on the matter and I am reassured by their caring and practical approach. It has been the responsibility of the Government to draw up the parameters of the provisions to amend the Constitution. This has not been an easy task and it has taken many months of consultations and deliberation. While there has been some sincere contributions in the House during the debate there has also been a cynical attempt by some who have deliberately tried to [241] create a climate of fear among women by saying that the wording of the proposed amendment on the substantive issue would put the lives of women at risk. The truth is the complete reverse the amendment sets out deliberately to save the life of the mother where her life is in danger. The proposed referendum seeks to restore the concept of the equal rights of the mother and the child. I have been nauseated by a number of speakers on the Opposition benches. All through this debate they have been looking for more time to discuss this issue but neither they nor their respective parties have made any positive contributions or supplied a wording to the Government in the hope that there would be consensus on this issue. This can be put down to one of two reasons:— either the Opposition were incapable of putting forward such a wording or else they did not have sufficient interest or commitment. It is easy to speak here in such debates but it is much more difficult and takes more time and effort to put forward concrete proposals for consideration. These have not been forthcoming from the Opposition parties to date. Therefore I can describe much of what has been said by members of the Opposition parties as bluster. While this may be an unfortunate hazard of political life from time to time, it should not be so evident on such a fundamental question as the one under discussion here today. There is much resistance in this House to the proposal that a referendum should be held. Let me ask the following questions. Why do so many Deputies on the opposite side of the House fear a referendum and why should they be so apprehensive about the decision of the people? Do they believe that the people are incapable of making the right decision or are they implying in some way that the people outside this House are less capable of making a decision than the legislators within it? The people in my constituency who have spoken to me directly about this matter want to be given the opportunity to express their view on such a personal and fundamental [242] matter. The Opposition parties should not attempt to thwart this basic right.;2626698

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;F;Mrs. Madeleine Taylor-Quinn;Fine Gael;It is now nine years since an amendment was introduced in the House to insert a clause in the Constitution. In 1983, we on this side of the House opposed that amendment but, unfortunately, Fianna Fáil, in a cynical political exercise, supported it and pushed it through the House to gain a short term political advantage. This amendment was subsequently carried in the referendum by the people. Since then there has been litigation which culminated in the X case. During the debate in this House sight has been lost of the terms of that case and the relief that was provided following the final decision in that sad and tragic case. Today we are discussing proposed amendments to the Constitution dealing with the right to travel and information and the issue of abortion itself. The Government have said that they have sought to achieve consensus but I believe that the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and his party have acted in a cynical manner and have disregarded the women of Ireland primarily for party political considerations. They have shown no consideration for the women of Ireland and this is evident from the manner in which they have sought this famous consensus — all they want to do is to ram these Bills through the House to gain political advantage. The Supreme Court decision earlier this year provided the country with an opportunity to address the issue once again but, unfortunately, we are going through the same experience. The Taoiseach has put his own party's interests first while the purpose of the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution is to cause the maximum amount of political embarrassment for all other parties. An attempt is being made to classify as proor anti-abortion certain Deputies and parties in this House who are attempting to adopt a responsible and thoughtful position on this extremely sensitive issue. A similar exercise was carried out in 1983. I was a member of the Fine Gael [243] Party in Government at that time and I remember the divisiveness and the appalling attitudes which were adopted at the instigation of Fianna Fáil. Here again an attempt is being made by that party to proceed down the same road. The intention of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice is particularly apparent and crude because obviously their first target in this campaign was their partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats. They decided they would push the Progressive Democrats into a corner and because of the manner in which Fianna Fáil were handling the matter they would be forced to leave Government. That crude and despicable tactic was adopted by the Taoiseach for a specific reason, to avoid presenting himself to give evidence at the Beef Tribunal. He avoided attending that tribunal on two previous occasions and he hoped to call a general election before he was next due to appear before the tribunal, which is next week.;2626699

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Laurence Kelly;Fianna Fáil;For many yet unborn the outcome of our deliberations, and the decision of the Irish people later, could, and most likely will, mean the difference between life and death. The Irish people are amongst the most fortunate on earth to have for their leaders a party of the calibre of Fianna Fáil, who are prepared to permit the Irish people to clearly express their views on this most important question. The Minister for Justice was faced with a mammoth task in trying to balance the conflicting opinions of the contending [211] parties on the most serious question of abortion. Those views vary from the outright demand for abortion of Democratic Left to the extreme pro-life contenders on the other side of the spectrum. Following the decision in the 'X' case the Government had no option but to put the issues, namely, the right to travel, the right to information on abortion and the substantive issue of abortion, before the Irish people for decision. The holding of referenda is the correct course of action because under our Constitution the people are the final arbiters on all questions of national importance. The issues involved are of the utmost national importance for our people and for future generations. The question of the right to travel is not in contention. We all accept that no self-respecting democracy could deny that right. The right to information is a little more contentious and will be carefully monitored by all. Some of the contention concerns the substantive issue of abortion and whether it should be available as a remedy for any malady that might occur in a pregnant woman. Since the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case made termination of the foetal human life available without limit within the jurisdiction the law of the land has been at variance with the wishes of a great majority of the people as expressed in the 1983 referendum. It is necessary, therefore, to correct that variance and restore the status quo ante the X case decision. The achievement of that result involves a problem of profound magnitude and complexity. On the one hand the life of the unborn must be protected by law and, on the other, the life of the mother must be equally protected. Those two positions must be reconciled. Several points come into play in that regard, of which, it is clear, the Government have taken due note. The four leading professors of gynaecology here signed a statement which declares that there is no know situation in which only abortion can be used as a remedy to treat a pregnant woman. Other means are available which in the [212] long run achieve a better result for women because although a woman's ailment may be healed after an abortion it is better to avoid the psychological trauma and scars associated with abortion. All are agreed that circumstances arise when a pregnancy, if it continued, would definitely put the life of a woman at risk. Ectopic pregnancy and cancer of the cervix are two examples of conditions which may give rise to such circumstances. Those two conditions, and a handful of other conditions similar to them, require treatment for a woman — that is, treatment necessary to save her life — that will invariably result in the loss of the life of the foetus. Better that one should be saved than both should perish. So far as I am aware, there is no objection on any grounds to the provison of that treatment. The distinction clearly drawn between life and health in the wording of the Amendment is based on the soundest and most up to date medical knowledge available. On that basis, I call on all who have the welfare of future generations of Irish people at heart to support the proposed wording and allow the right to life of the unborn to flourish in this land. This would correct a position at variance with the Ireland with which Fianna Fáil, and the majority of Irish people, feel comfortable.

That is unfortunate for the women of Ireland. The Taoiseach's attitude towards reaching a consensus on this issue is worth examining. He failed to differentiate between his position as Leader of Fianna Fáil and his constitutional position as Taoiseach of a Coalition Government, [244] which carries with it an obligation to take on board the views of his Coalition partners but he failed to do that.;2626704

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).;21.10.92;M;Mr. Jim Kemmy;Independent Labour;I am a person of good will but I would not agree with the previous speaker because at this stage of the debate most people outside the House are sick and tired of the torrents of words. They will certainly be very confused after we have all spoken. I am a little upset that a small, powerful and influential group of people have been able to hijack and debase the words 'pro-life'. Those people are a very small, unrepresentative sector of our community but politicians have run scared from them in the past — more is the pity. I have no intention of running scared today, no more than I did not ten years ago. [213] In 1983 Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were railroaded into holding a referendum. That was rather foolish. The late Frank Cluskey, then leader of the Labour Party, told them he would not agree to that but he was the only one of the three party leaders who did not cave in to the blackmail. It was a great pity to have that divisive referendum in 1983, which did nothing for our country. That referendum was a big mistake in that it follows a most narrow, divisive and abstract debate which did nothing to cast any reason or light on this complex issue. The same thing is happening now. A small group of people have an obsession with unborn life but, as far as I can tell, show no concern for those who have been born and the quality of life of the living. People who are genuinely pro-life are concerned about issues such as unemployment, poverty, emigration and Third World countries. They are concerned with the fact that as we speak women are dying in childbirth in Third World countries. Far too many women die in childbirth there and nobody in this part of the world seems to worry unduly about that. Quality of life is as important as life itself. Famine and starvation throughout the world are on all sides of us and people do not seem to worry about that. That type of life does not seem to bother people neither does the fact that we have young people sleeping rough in Dublin, London and New York. We have heard much in this debate about protecting the family and much sanctimonious hypocrisy and claptrap were used about this also. My mother came from County Clare. She was one of 15 children, 14 of whom emigrated to America. I do not see much evidence of protection for the family or family life and for those who had to emigrate. I know something about emigration and unemployment as I have experienced both. How does one qualify to be regarded as pro-life in our society? Is it by talking constantly and using the words 'pro-life'? Does that qualify one to be called a 'pro-lifer'? Is it by working in areas with people who are unemployed, who [214] are under-privileged and who are badly off? I would regard people who have a track record, working for people and trying to improve the quality of their lives as pro-life. They are not just proclaiming they are pro-life: actions speak louder than words in this and other areas. People show concern for people by their work, activities and by their track record rather than just speaking about pro-life in an abstract, artificial way. We must try to help the weaker sections of our society to lead a decent life and to have a decent quality of life. Too many of the so called pro-life people have a negative rather than a positive attitude to this whole question. They pray for peace with words and formulae rather than life itself. We have heard words and various terms being used in this debate but nothing has been done to solve the problem of abortion in our society or in other societies. Words in themselves will solve nothing whatsoever. In this debate words are being used to evade and skirt around the real issues rather than tackle those issues. People inside and outside this House are deluding themselves into believing that the issue of abortion can be solved if they put a hypocritical and deficient form of words before this House and if these words are carried by a majority of the Members of this House. This belief is an evasion of truth and an evasion of reality. Passing this formula of words in this House will do nothing whatsoever to stop Irish women from having abortions if they wish to have them and could, in fact, do considerable damage and harm if interpreted in a very narrow way, as is likely to happen. The exercise we are engaging in now will solve nothing and is an evasion of the hard cases, as they have been so called. No amount of hammering or pious platitudes, inside or outside this House, can tackle this situation. The hard cases I have described will not go away and we cannot run away from them. If we are honest with ourselves as public representatives we must confront those hard cases and other cases as well. Our party and the Labour Party have a united [215] approach to this issue. We have tried to confront the issue in an open, honest way and put forward a form of words that will improve, rather than hinder, the present situation. As has been pointed out by many speakers the Consititution is an imprecise, imperfect way of dealing with this issue. The Constitution is a framework, a guide to life and it guarantees rights for our people. It was never designed to deal with this complex matter before the House. It cannot be dealt with as though it were black or white, as has been presented here today. We politicians have been presented as if we were somewhat like national gate people controlling sluice gates keeping certain things out of our society. That is a wrong way of looking at our job. Our job is to legislate for people here and now and to improve the quality of life in our country we are not a kind of moral gate people as some people think. In any case, life is not like that. We live in a different world now, a world of communications, where people have rights to travel and rights to information. We cannot turn the clock back 20, 30 or 50 years. Ireland is not the world. We are a very small country with a very small population. The Bills before the House will not change anything in the big world outside and neither will they change much in this country. Fianna Fáil are trying to have it both ways. They are as cute as they have always been and they are too cute by half on this occasion by kicking to touch on a most complex and difficult issue. The referendum is a mistake and should not be held. The wording of the Twelfth Amendment is flawed. It can only be a matter of time before this issue and the wording of the Amendment will be challenged in the courts and will come before this House once again. I believe we have wasted an opportunity to do some good for our people. As it stands, the words in the Twelfth Amendment are illegal and a medical minefield. You will find that my words will come to pass. Next time around — there certainly will [216] be a next time — let us hope we will do better. I regard this debate as a lost opportunity, a lost chance for us to have done better by far. I have listened carefully to many people who have contributed to the debate, including the Progressive Democrats, who should not be let off the hook. They have the opportunity to challenge this in a positive way by voting against it. They have wasted that opportunity and have dodged and funked it. So far as I am concerned, this whole debate has been a waste of time and money. It is nothing more than a monument of bogus punditary and more is the pity. I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Shea.;2626707

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;F;Mrs. Madeleine Taylor-Quinn;Fine Gael;Before the adjournment of the debate I expressed concern at statements made by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications during the course of the debate in the House today. I am particularly concerned that, as the only woman Cabinet member, she expressed questionable opinions on this amendment. She said that any wording which provokes the extremes of an argument into such vehement antipathy requires courage. I suggest that any wording that raises so many arguments from so many reasonable people must be seriously flawed. Rather than saying that it requires courage the Minister should seriously question the flaws in the wording. A common theme throughout the debate from the Fianna Fáil side of the House is that anybody who does not agree with the Fianna Fáil view is an extremist, a political opportunist or indeed an abortionist, or has some hidden agenda. That type of contribution to this debate is extremely unfortunate because what we are attempting to address is a very serious and sensitive issue. On 17 February 1983 in volume 340, column 494 of the Official Report, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said: ... can we be certain that the existing ban on abortion will not be removed as a result of action in the courts? The referendum will give the people rather than the courts ultimate control over policy in this area. Abortion could become legal as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court. [291] Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn went on to say in column 496 of the Official Report: It must be clear that the only way to make certain that abortion does not become legal in Ireland in the coming years is to write into the Constitution an amendment which reinforces the existing law against abortion. We now know that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was wrong then. Is there any reason to believe that her contribution in this House today is right? The wording of the amendment is extremely flawed and deserves much examination. Everybody in this House is pro-life. I find abortion difficult to deal with and I am opposed to it but as a publicly elected representative I have a responsibility, as does every other Member of the House, to adequately and properly address the difficult and tragic situations which arise every day for a minority of women and for the unborn. In these minority of cases difficult choices have to be made. The Taoiseach and the Government have a responsibility not to put this greviously flawed amendment to the people for a decision. It would be more opportune for the Taoiseach to enter into genuine dialogue with all the political parties to resolve this complex question.;2626770

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;I thank Deputy Taylor-Quinn for sharing her time with me and giving me an opportunity to speak on this matter. Like most people in this House, when I reflect on my political past there are some things that I regret. I can honestly say that what I regret most in 11½ years in this House was that in the autumn of 1982 I did not do enough to oppose the nonsensical idea that we needed to write into our Constitution a pro-life amendment, as it was called. I remember that time very well. Perhaps it would not have made much difference, but I regret, as perhaps do other people in this House, that we did not speak out much more clearly and forcefully against the utter futility of that whole campaign, which was demonstrated to us very [292] clearly this year and which is the reason we are having this debate again. There may well be people on all sides of the House today who, looking back on this debate in a few years' time, will regret they did not on this occasion speak out more clearly against the futility of what is being attempted in these three amendments before us.;2626771

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;Perhaps some people will reflect upon that between now and 3 December, or indeed between now and the conclusion of these debates, and learn a lesson from it. I remember very clearly the occasion in the autumn of 1982 when we had a meeting with representatives from the group who proposed the amendment — I will say nothing against those people personally or about their motivation — and I regret that more people did not say how unwise the amendment was. We regret that now that we find ourselves in a mess. We are having this debate as a result of that attempt to do an impossible constitutional thing at the time. The campaign at that time was based on the proposition that neither politicians nor the courts can be trusted, a very mistaken proposition. A wording was presented to us as being an infallible way of preventing abortion. The people who recommended that wording — the pro-life campaign, Fianna Fáil and a great many other groups, a member of one of which spoke this evening — gave, in spite of advice to the contrary, what they believed to be categoric assurances that it would have the result they wanted but it had precisely the opposite result. That has vindicated the advice given at the time by the then Taoiseach, the Attorney General and others, including a great number of people who made clear their reservations and were branded as abortionists. Another reason for this debate relates to the most appalling mess made by the Government of the infamous Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty. We still do not [293] know where that came from, why the Government believed it should be inserted in the Treaty and what its function was to be. If it ever had a function, that has been totally distorted, perverted, and turned upside down since, to the point where yesterday neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Justice could tell us what the implications of these three proposals for referenda will be. Today we have to hold this debate because of gross misjudgments by a self-appointed lobby and by Fianna Fáil. It is outrageous that another Bill which we will debate next week — the Referendum (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill — which prescribes a title for the guidance of voters in each of the three referenda, describes the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution on the ballot paper under the heading 'Right to Life', which is a cyncial distortion of what it is about. If the ballot paper should have any heading it should be in the full sense of the Bill before us 'Termination of Pregnancy' and nothing else. It is also outrageous that members of the Government should accuse anyone in this House of wishing to sow confusion in this debate. If I may be personal, I was disappointed to find among members of the Government making that accusation the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, a person for whom I have considerable respect as a politician and a colleague. It is perverse and bizarre for members of the Government to accuse the Opposition of sowing seeds of confusion. The Taoiseach said different things on different occasions about what the words in these amendments mean. The night after the Taoiseach made his pronouncement the Minister for Health said that the words mean something different the Minister for Justice said that the words meant something different again. If anyone in the House is sowing confusion in regard to the meaning of the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, it is the Government. They do not know what it means and they cannot credibly give us any guarantees about what it means. Ministers are confused and the worst part is that they are confused about [294] different things at different times. There is only one thing about which we can be absolutely sure in this debate, that we have every reason to be deeply suspicious and sceptical about any assurances given to us by the Taoiseach or by any of his Ministers on what the words in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution mean. The experience of 1983 should clearly show that. Of course the Government are deeply divided on the issue. I listened attentively to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I also read his circulated text with considerable interest. There is a great deal of common ground in regard to the issues between the Minister and myself and I share many of the concerns which he set out clearly in his contribution. I find it almost incredible that Minister O'Malley should hold such views and still decide to act, as he and his colleagues in the progressive Democrats apparently intend to act, when we come to vote on these issues. I said I found it almost incredible. I use the word 'almost' advisedly because his position would be utterly incredible if there had not already been a series of Cabinet disagreements on very important issues where, in each case, the Progressive Democrats decided that the issue was not important enough to force their resignation from Government. Given all that happened since the election in 1989 — and the multiplicity of undertakings in Mark I and Mark II of the Programme for Government which have not been lived up to — I wonder what kind of political cataclysm would be required for the Progressive Democrats to take their courage in their hands and decide that it was time to withdraw. At present they remind me of a party of Arctic explorers marooned on an ice floe of their own making. They know that if they stay there it will melt and they will be submerged and if they jump off they will probably be drowned. The proposed Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution deserves to be rejected, even if only on the grounds that it contains those fatal words 'as distinct from the health' when it speaks about [295] mothers. I have heard all the reasons the Government gave for the inclusion of those words and I have also heard the medical and legal advice which lies behind the decision to include them. However, I must emphasise that this issue — as in the case of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution — requires Members of the Oireachtas to decide the form of the words to be put before the people and whether any words should be put to them. It is not a matter for decision by any lobby groups, no matter how well intentioned neither is it a matter for decision by lawyers or medical experts. By all means let us take the advice of people who have locus standi in regard to this issue but, at the end of the day, the issues must be decided in this House, using the advice available to us according to our lights. The advice on the health issue — as indeed in regard to all the other issues — is not unanimous. Doctors and lawyers differ but politicians still must decide. Our experience of the Eighth Amendment should surely show us that if we are given conflicting, well-founded advice on any part of the issue it is prudent to assume that some of the advice which warns us of possible unintended effect, to borrow a word from another part of this debate, should be taken very seriously, even if the possibility of those unintended effects seem remote. That is the central lesson of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. There is another consideration having listened to all the medical and legal advice I return to my politician's perception of what modern medical practice seems to tell us about how we should treat the individual. The lesson surely is that we must take a holistic view of the interaction of all aspects of the health and life of the individual. I was very impressed a few moments ago to hear Deputy McDaid say that, he found that our experience of life is determined by our health and we cannot separate the two. It is good medical practice to treat the person as a whole, as a physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual [296] being. Good medical practice in any branch of medicine requires that we have regard for each component of the individual personality and being. To separate issues of health from issues of life seems to be utterly artificial. The inspiration for the inclusion of the words in the proposed Amendment seems to come from what I can only regard as a totally unfathomable distinction drawn by the Attorney General between life threatening and life shortening conditions or events. We do not have access to the Attorney General in this House. However, I should like to ask him what that distinction means. If any Member of the House was walking down Kildare Street and was set on by a mugger who held a knife to his or her ribs, would we regard that as life threatening or life shortening? Would we give a damn about the difference between the two? I do not know how the Attorney General can use this kind of artificial distinction as a basis for putting words into our Constitution. How can any sane person base a constitutional provision on that kind of nonsensical distinction? It is surely the kind of approach to medical practice which, for years, attempted to resolve the problem of physical and mental health experienced by women in our society and in other societies by the prescription of Librium and Valium in the hope that mild sedation, physical and mental, would help a woman to deal with her problems by ignoring them instead of having them resolved. That view is, in turn, part of a view of women which is peculiar to a particular blinkered male point of view which holds that women are different and, therefore, inferior. It is a view which regards motherhood as a function or duty rather than as a fundamental, personal, emotional and physical choice which should be entered into only after great deliberation. I reject that view of women and I will have no hand, act or part in putting through a constitutional provision which treats any women that way — a wife, mother, sister, aunt, friend, neighbour, a colleague or even an opponent. We should not revert to that nonsensical, inimical and life threatening [297] view of woman's place in our society from which I had hoped we had begun to move away. Taking that view on these issues, I have to reject utterly any assurance given to us by the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Health or any other Minister about what that particular exclusion in the text of the amendment means for women. None of them is in a position to give us any assurances as to what that exclusion means for the treatment of women in Ireland if that referendum is passed. I am prepared to go as far as to believe that those Ministers may very well mean that the assurances they give reflect their own personal and true intentions, but they cannot expect us to believe, in the light of what happened with the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, that they can guarantee that those words will actually mean what those Ministers say they mean and only that. When any doubt or challenge arises the only body that can tell us what the words mean is the Supreme Court. It is a gross error to introduce into our Constitution a distinction between threats to life and threats to health based on this insane lawyer's artificial distinction — and it is the distinction that I say is insane, not the lawyer — between life threatening and life shortening, which, as far as I have been able to find out, has no basis whatsoever in medical doctrine, practice or fact. The proposed amendment also contains a reference to self destruction that excludes the risk of self destruction from being a justification for termination of a pregnancy. Conventional wisdom as we have heard it in the past few weeks and the weight of legal and medical advice seems to indicate that if we were to allow the risk of self-destruction as a grounds for abortion what we would be doing in effect is providing for open abortion, abortion on demand. The Government say they want to avoid making abortion available on demand, and the way they choose to do so is by excluding the risk of self destruction from the terms of the proposed amendment. Incidentally, the Government tell us that that is the only [298] way to avoid making abortion available on demand. The same Government tell us that if the proposed amendment is not carried they will introduce legislation that will have the effect of ensuring that the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case cannot and will not be used as a justification for widespread abortion, abortion on demand. The logic of that seems to me to be that the Government are saying that the Supreme Court decision means abortion on demand, and they are going to legislate. The Government say that they do not want to have abortion on demand. If the Government are going to legislate they must therefore intend to propose to us — however much in terrorem it may be — something that would limit, circumvent or restrict the grounds for abortion in some way. Unless the Government are being completely cynical in this, with the intention of producing words only to terrorise the people who might have the temerity to vote 'no' in the referendum, the Government must believe that there is some way of restricting the scope of application of the Eighth Amendment as it now stands. If the Government believe that it would be possible to do that in the event that the Twelfth Amendment were not carried they must also, if they are even half-way honest, believe that that could be done even if a modified version of the Twelfth Amendment were put before the people and passed. I have heard the legal and medical advice and I have listened to what conventional wisdom says, and I do not have anything to put in its place, I readily admit that, but I have to confess that that conventional wisdom and legal and medical advice leave me sceptical. Simplistic argument from alleged cause to possible effect leaves me unsatisfied, whether that argument comes from a legal expert, a medical expert or a constitutional commentator. Even more than that, one thought keeps coming back to me as I listen to all this debate: how will we react and what will our consciences say to us when the day comes — as it most surely will —[299] when it is found that a woman, by reason of being pregnant, has taken her life, notwithstanding a supportive family, social and community environment? For the relatives of any such woman and for anybody who cares, the current conventional wisdom and all of the legal and medical advice will disappear like a puff of smoke and those of us who will know about it will be left with a huge question mark. I am very conscious of that aspect because my party have proposed in the Seanad a Bill to decriminalise suicide. I think many people in the House would support that measure. That Bill sets out to achieve a certain number of objectives. We want to decriminalise suicide in order that coroners can bring in verdicts of suicide so that it will be possible to investigate, if we can, what the causes of the suicide were. We all know that there are many suicides in this country that are not recorded as suicide for all the reasons with which I shall not bore the House tonight. What if we were to succeed in decriminalising suicide and were then to find out that in this country every year some women — I do not know how many, the figure is not ascertainable — take their own lives, are driven to that extremity, because they are pregnant and feel that their circumstances would not allow them, for one reason or another, to carry a baby to term and to raise that child? I do not know how many such cases there are all I know is that there are some. There might very well be cases in which, though the family of such a woman, her extended family, her neighbours and her friends would have had among them people who could have been relied on to support the woman both morally and materially in the raising of a family, she decided that suicide was the only way out for her. What does conventional wisdom say to us about a case of that kind? What do the legal experts and the medical experts tell us about such a case? They cannot tell us anything. Yet this Government say they are confident they have every good reason for excluding the ground of suicide as a basis for [300] even considering a termination of pregnancy. Not all of the advice goes in the same direction. I shall not bore the House by going into detail. I shall only make reference to the advice. In The Irish Times of Saturday last two eminent practitioners produced a report on their review of the literature. Also last week the Psychological Society of Ireland produced their own statement and a review of the research. It makes very interesting reading and there is a great deal more to be examined and debated. Those reflections about the health issue and about the suicide issue should surely be reflections that at the very least would cause the Government to pause in their gallop towards holding the referenda on 3 December. There are apparently three reasons the Government are anxious to go ahead with these amendments. The House heard the Taoiseach on that subject today. He says he has given his word. It is very honourable to keep one's word, but the Taoiseach expects the Opposition parties and this House to help him keep his word on this issue, when he is not too worried about others, when his Government and a Cabinet subcommittee have spent six or seven months combing out the issues — and they are still confused, they still think the words mean different things — but expect the House in the space of a few days to come to conclusions on that. The second reason the Taoiseach apparently gave was that he wants to get the show on the road, whatever that means. If that is part of the Taoiseach's motive I would have to question his seriousness. The third reason, which the Taoiseach apparently gave in public on RTE one day last week, is that if the referenda are delayed for any time after 3 December the referenda and Christmas shopping will get in each other's way. If that is what the Taoiseach has in his mind then I have to conclude that he has no real conception — to use a malapropism — of what he is at and the importance of the issue he is trying to rush through the House. I know the Taoiseach is thin on philosophy, [301] but that is absolutely threadbare. If the Taoiseach and the Government are really serious about a proper potitical evaluation of all these issues then they have to give more time to this. I do not think even the Government have had a proper political evaluation, or else why would the two parties in Government be totally at odds on the issue and why would Ministers in the same Government be running related briefs telling us that the words mean different things at different times to different people? I conclude where I started. Frankly, I would be unable to live with my conscience if we repeated the same mistake that we made in 1983 and allow ourselves to be pushed into a fundamental and unnecessary, but certainly ill considered, set of referenda without the political, human and moral dimensions having been properly debated, whatever about the medical and legal implications.;2626773

First of all, I would like to state that I do not question the intention and the bona fides of the Government and the manner in which they address this very complex and difficult issue. When the courts interpret what we do here they will not look at what was said by any Minister as being his intention they will look at what we insert into the Constitution or into the legislation. They have made it very clear that is no part of their function to look behind what is written either in the Constitution or in the legislation. They would see it as an obligation to implement that intention through the appropriate legal formula. Second, in relation to intention, there is some precedent where intention has clearly not been realised. Perhaps the most significant precedent is that of the intention of David Steel when he introduced the Medical (Termination of Pregnancy) Bill in the House of Commons on 22 July 1966. When introducing that legislation he said, and I quote from column 1075 of Hansard of 22 July 1966: We want to stamp out back-street [302] abortions, but it is not the intention of the Promoters of the Bill to leave a wide open door for abortion on request. Clearly that was his position and that of those who promoted the Bill at that time. In the event it is a matter of fact that what has resulted in England, despite the intentions and the bona fides of David Steel and his co-promoters, has been without any doubt abortion on request. Therefore we have clear indications that intentions alone will not bring about the result we want to achieve to regulate order in our society in the manner in which we feel obliged to do it. At that time he also said there were various estimates of the number of abortions taking place in England, that these were somewhere in the region of 40,000, but some people said the number could be as high as 200,000 per annum. By any objective judgment at this point, whatever about the accuracy of the estimate of between 40,000 and 200,000, we also know as a fact — and facts speak for themselves — that the number of abortions in England now is a vast multiple of the higher number of 200,000.;2626774

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;That may be. Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to make my case and then he can make his. If the Deputy wishes to question those figures, fair enough. Incidentally, David Steel also said, and I quote from column 1070 of the same debate: Therefore we find that whereas at one end of the country — in Aberdeen, under the wider ambit of Scots law and under the practice of Professor Sir Dugald Baird and his colleagues — a fairly large proportion of those desiring medical terminations of their pregnancies are able to achieve this, in some other parts of the country it is almost impossible. The other three means are all illegal. Certainly, Britain has changed [303] dramatically from the time that that legislation was introduced, the purpose of which was not to introduce abortion on demand. For that reason it is a very deep and complex issue. Like many others in Ireland, I have a deep abhorrence of abortion. Equally — and I hope I share this view with the vast majority of Irish people — I want to ensure that all necessary medical treatment at all times is available to save the life of the mother in any circumstance of the kind we are dealing with here. I have to acknowledge I am dealing with a matter in which I do not have either competence or professional experience. I should like to quote from one of a number of consultants who wrote to me: My experience over forty one years, and I have seen a few maternal deaths, has been that there are no indications for direct abortion to save the woman's life. To suggest otherwise is not true. This is not to say that women who require treatment of any illness in pregnancy should not receive it, even if this should place the baby at risk. It is possible that, occasionally, the risk may result in the loss of the baby, but this is not the intended effect of the treatment which is to cure the mother. He goes on to state: If there was a case for carrying out abortions in pregnancy to save a mother's life, surely this would have been reported in the maternity hospital statistics from Dublin, which have been published for fifty years or more. In these reports all abnormal maternity cases are analysed in detail, including any maternal deaths that may have occurred. That is one man's view and I acknowledge, as the Minister has said, that there are different views on this. But it does appear that these reports, which are there to inform and update the consultants involved, are consistent in that direction. As a consequence of what has happened since 1983 it is fair to say that the public at [304] this point, even in conservative Ireland, would wish that we their representatives could be addressing our minds to something more pressing for them, even those who reject and abhor abortion. There has been a sorry sequence of events since 1983. I think I am free to say — and I will allow myself to put it on the record because it is well known within our party — that when it was originally proposed in 1983 that I strongly advised against the introduction of the pro-life amendment as it was called. I saw no need either because of the constitutional position or the legal position. I found myself on one occasion even in the position of taking an action based on the Civil Liability Act, 1961, in which the unborn had acquired a right through what we did here to an action after birth in respect of a trauma to the mother before birth. To me at that point the line was consistent and clear, but in the event we had a referendum. My concern then was that the words that were being imported would be capable of interpretation of the kind we have now had and therefore we have had the reference to the Supreme Court. I might have a view on that too but I do not propose to offer it here. The Supreme Court gave their interpretation of the formula of wording used based on the criterion of real and substantial risk to the life of the mother and the risk of suicide. The Amendments being put forward now are a consequence of that decision. The constitutional Amendments relate to three elements: the right to travel, the right to information and the substantive issue. I have said consistently — I hold this view more strongly now than when I first expressed it at a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting held some months ago — that it is a nonsense in a democratic country to hold a referendum on the right to travel. It should be pointed out that totalitarian states such as the Soviet Union, Albania and China only survived by preventing their people from travelling. If any of those countries had decided to introduce a referendum to change their constitution so that people would have the right to travel it would [305] have been regarded as a significant move. As I said, thousands of Irish people have exercised their democratic right to travel and it is a nonsense to try to introduce into our Constitution a right which already exists. I have reread the judgments given by the Supreme Court judges in the X case. I obtained copies of these judgments from the Library. Unless there has been some change in the meantime and those judgments have been somehow changed or qualified, I cannot agree with the Minister's statement, and I quote: The Supreme Court decided by a three to two majority that while an injunction would not be given to restrain a woman from travelling abroad, such an injunction can be given to restrain travel abroad to obtain an abortion where there is no such risk. I cannot find such a statement in my copies of the judgments. I have read the judgments delivered by Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, the late Mr. Justice McCarthy and Mr. Justice Hederman. The Chief Justice makes it quite clear that having dealt with the substantive issue, the other matters come within the category — this term is well known to lawyers — of obiter dictum. He offered views in relation to the right to travel. As I said, I have read the Supreme Court judgments and I cannot find any reference to the need to limit the right to travel. Of course, this is not the major issue. Therefore, I do not think it is necessary to introduce a constitutional amendment in this regard. I wish to refer to the right to information. Many views have been expressed about the Supreme Court decision, whether they were right or wrong and whether they correctly interpreted the views of the people. It is a principle of the Supreme Court that they bind themselves by existing decisions unless they change them. I am referring to the principle of stare decisis, stand by your decision. As recently as 16 March 1988 in the Attorney General and Open Door Counselling [306] Limited case the Supreme Court held, and I quote: The Court doth declare that the activities of the Defendants, their servants or agents in assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction to travel abroad to obtain abortions by referral to a clinic by the making of their travel arrangements, or by informing them of the identity and location of and method of communication with a specified clinic or clinics are unlawful, having regard to the provisions of Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. That is the law as it stands. The Minister said that the issue of information and counselling did not come before the Supreme Court in the X case but in previous cases the court decided that the dissemination of information on abortion was unlawful having regard to Article 40. 3.3.º This is correct. However, he went on to say that one effect of the decision in the X case appears to be that it is not unlawful to communicate information. I am not going to argue this point I am simply saying that that is simply an interpretation of what would appear to be the effect when the law and the Supreme Court decision make it clear and do not need an interpretation. However, these are not the crucial issues in this debate. A number of issues arose out of the Supreme Court decision in the X case, one of which was the suicide issue. The Government have decided to vary the Supreme Court decision in regard to the provision of information. I agree with them in this respect. I do not question the right of the Government or this Legislature to do that. To a certain extent they are also varying the Supreme Court obiter dictum in regard to the right to travel. This is not of major importance. As I said from the beginning, this is not even an issue at this point we are asking the people to vote on what I regard as a characteristic of democracy. If we are varying the Supreme Court in those areas, I do not understand why we should feel totally bound not to vary their decision in regard to the substantive [307] issue. During the course of the X case the State argued at all times that the test to be applied was one of immediate or inevitable risk to the life of the mother. The Supreme Court held, as they are entitled to do, that it would be more appropriate to have regard to real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. This is where I have major problems. It is open to the Government to make it clear that they believe — I believe this view is shared by the vast majority of Irish people — the test should be of immediate and inevitable risk to the life of the mother as distinct from a real and substantial risk to her life. However, this is not being done. I have serious concern in this area. The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill states: It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction. The use of such phraseology invites interpretation. Whether we agree or disagree — I respect the view of those people who disagree — about the provision restricting divorce, at least it clearly states that no law shall be enacted to provide for the dissolution of marriage. Some say that this provision should not be there while others say it should be, but at least it is clear. If we use phraseology such as 'save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving risk to a real and substantial risk to her life' we run the risk — I agree with the intention of the Government in this area — of a new range of interpretations which quite frankly I do not think is desirable. The intentions of the Government in this area could be effectively met by saying 'it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother'. The provision in regard to the rights of the mother will not in any event replace [308] the original Amendment it is an addition to it and the courts can interpret it. I am very worried about this wording. A cogent case can be made for the introduction of legislation to clarify and regulate the Government's intention in this area.;2626776

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;I think it is fair to say that the majority of doctors in professional practice who will push out the limits are not those who adhere to the standards of the General Medical Council. They were not the people who pushed out the limits in the United Kingdom. It was others who took a different interpretation, one not supported by the majority of their colleagues, not to mention the Medical Council. They pushed out the limits and the 40,000 or 200,000 abortions, depending on the figure one took, became millions. I am aware that some of those are Irish women but that is not a major factor in the huge increase in the abortion rate in England. For that reason, it is desirable that we leave open the prospect of introducing legislation to regulate the application of this referendum. I am glad the Minister has not closed his mind to this prospect. This is a very complex issue and I acknowledge that the Government have inherited it. I accept that the Government of which I was a member, in a sense, passed this problem on but that is history. I hope that what we are about to do now will not give rise to further complications which will mean that we will be constantly bedevilled by discussion on this and, at the end of the day, not protect the life of the mother or the unborn one whit more than in 1983. This wording concerns me but the position arising from the Supreme Court decision requires certain adjustments, otherwise a threatened suicide could be put forward as a case for abortion. I hope that what we do now will mean that we will have finality, clarity and protection for the life of the unborn and the mother. Having regard to the practice [309] over the years I do not see why there is any reason one should be put at risk to protect the other 50 years of practice proved that not to be necessary.;2626778

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Dick Roche;Fianna Fáil;This is a very complex and stark issue. There are few issues which could be of more fundamental importance than it. I am pleased that the debate tonight has been conducted in a somewhat calmer tone than some of the contributions last night. There is a great tradition in Ireland of sticking our heads in the sand in the hope that issues will resolve themselves, of hoping that further discussion, another report or reconsideration of the issue will push decision day to the point where the problem resolves itself. However, that is not the worst characteristic of public debate in Ireland. The worst characteristic is that our tradition has been to tear ourselves asunder in debate, not simply to prove one's point but to destroy the other's viewpoint. Some of the epithets that were slung around last night had that venal underpinning in them. This latter characteristic of Irish debate was well dealt with in the beef tribunal last week when a former Taoiseach quoted a stanza from W. B. Yeats's poem 'Leaders of the Crowd'. He stated: They must to keep their certainty accuse all that are different of a base intent pull down established honour hawk for news, whatever their loose fantasy invent. That characteristic of debate simply adds to the confusion, distaste and dismay that [310] must exist up and down the country with regard to this issue presenting itself again. Another characteristic of Irish debate is to descend to humbug and hypocrisy and to focus on the past rather than the future. There has been a great deal of rewriting of history, of focusing on the past and wondering who was more venal than whom in 1982. That does not matter. All that should matter is that we are faced with the reality of the problem and we must make decisions in that regard. Those distressing elements have existed in this debate. I have my certainties on this issue and I hope I can express them without accusing anyone. I know there are diametrically opposing views in this House, I have always taken the view that abortion is abhorrent. That is a deeply felt personal conviction but if we try meddling in this issue and take on board some of the lunatic suggestions that have been put forward, we would end up with a more horrific situation than we found ourselves in earlier this year. I hope I can express my views without being accused. Three parties in this House have a very clear view on this issue. The Democratic Left Party hold a view which I do not share but they have expressed that view very honestly. They are a pro-choice party although Deputy Byrne might take issue with the use of words 'pro-choice'. I do not say that they are pro-choice in an accusatory manner. They believe abortion is a right which, subject to certain conditions — they have spelled them out — should be available. I do not agree with Democratic Left but I admire their candour. They are not afraid to express their views and we should acknowledge courage where we see it. The Labour Party believe that this whole area should be dealt with in legislation. It is clear that this view also exists in other quarters of this House. They realise that this would mean legislating in regard to the decision in the X case which would mean going beyond the common interpretation of the people's judgment as recorded in the 1983 referendum. Deputy Ferris gave his interpretation of [311] what the people did in 1983 with which I am in accord. I do not agree with the view of the Labour Party. If one wishes to protect a fundamental right the only appropriate place to do so is in a constitution. However, I respect the fact that they have a view and their willingness to put it forward with clarity. I also laud their consistency because as far back as 1982 they argued that all that was needed in this regard was legislation. I differed from them at that time. I was not a participant in the debate in 1983 simply because I was not here, not because I was not involved in politics. I had grave doubts about that whole matter at that time. In Government, the Labour Party argued that legislation could achieve what most Irish people wanted. The view of the Fianna Fáil Party was elaborated on by the Minister for Justice last night. I do not intend to add or detract from that view because it was made clearly. Some of the epithets from other spokespersons distressed me. For example, some of the language used by Deputy Shatter was objectionable, unnecessarily vitriolic and personalised. I do not know what can be achieved by that in this debate. There will be enough bitterness in the weeks running up to the referenda without adding to it. The wording the Minister put before us has been the subject of a great deal of parsing and analysis and will be the subject of a great deal more. The two parties I mentioned have indicated their outright opposition to it. I accept the sincerity of their arguments but I do not find them persuasive. I find it impossible to accept some of the philosophical underpinnings of their arguments but at least I know where they stand. The main Opposition's party's response to this issue is another matter. They object to the starkness of the wording. After the wording was published I admit that I was stunned by what appeared to be a very stark set of words, the reality of course is that this is a very stark issue and whatever about the starkness of the words, they at least go to the [312] heart of the issue. The fact that there are people on both extremes of this argument, I do not mean extremes in this House but extremes outside this House, who have found almost as much equally to condemn, suggests to me that the Minister has found middle ground. I cannot understand, for example, why Fine Gael are making such an issue out of the reference to health. I realise it is a stark set of words. I cannot understand why people, who object to those words but at the same time understand the reason for their inclusion, cannot produce an alternative set of words. The arguments put forward by the Minister for the use of that particular phrase seem to be cogent and clear. They at least give us choices with which we can agree or disagree. If we remove that phrase, which I understand many Members have found objectionable, we will create a situation which would not be favoured by the vast majority of Deputies and we would be misleading the people in that they might have to bear the impact of another referendum for another change in the Constitution. The Irish people and many supporters of the main Opposition party and the majority of the backbenchers I have spoken to, would seem to be at variance with some of the views of the party's Front Bench spokespersons. Though I have tried to understand exactly where Fine Gael stand on this issue I have failed to do so. From the speeches made here over the last two days the party appear to be facing at least three different directions. They want to extend the debate. Their spokesman who regularly comes into this Chamber to rail against the Government for failing to bring forward proposals on different issues argues that the timetable put forward by the Minister for this issue is too short. Even though we are going to tear ourselves apart again on this issue over the next seven weeks, there seems to be a suggestion that if we prolong the agony it would in some way be a good thing. I contest that this is not the case. Their spokesman tells us that he has had discussions with members of the [313] medical profession who shared his views in regard to the danger of incorporating the reference to health. I have had discussions with members of the medical profession as well. There are copious references signed by people in authority in the IMO, by gynaecologists, obstetricians and psychologists. In all the specialties there are people on both sides of the argument. We all know that there are medical doctors on both sides of the argument. It has been suggested by the leading Opposition party particularly, that there is a view in regard to the psychiatry aspect. I read Dr. Anthony Clare's paper with interest. It was a very absorbing and timely paper and it has been referred to a good deal in this debate in relation to the suicide issue. Dr. Anthony Clare is not the only psychiatrist with a view on this. Professor Patricia Casey's article in the Irish Independent on 18 March portrays a contrary view. I will deal with the suicide issue later. We would have little difficulty in finding lawyers and barristers who differ — verbal battles and dextrous differentiation are the lawyers' trade — and Deputy Shatter knows that better than most. This matter is of such a fundamental nature and opinions on it are so polarised that it is futile to suggest that if we wait another week, another month or another year that some commonly acceptable set of words, which encompass all the various aspirations, will emerge. We know that that is not the case. It is better to face that now and to bring the issues, stark as they are, to the electorate at an early date, rather than prevaricate endlessly on this issue. Further prevarication on this issue would be dangerous. There are two other aspects of the contributions from Fine Gael which I find extraordinary. One was the manner in which they dealt with the suicide issue. My understanding was, with the exception of one or two conscientious objections from that party, that in general the party accepted that the suicide issue had to be addressed and, in fact, there was agreement with the Government that it [314] should be excluded as a reason for allowing abortion. Yet tonight that does not appear to be the line taken by Deputy Dukes and by other speakers. I am amazed at what seems to be a change of direction in the party's policy — if they have a policy on this — during the course of the contributions over the last 24 hours. Much attention has been paid to a very timely produced paper by Dr. Anthony Clare and a colleague last weekend. That paper provided a service in that it gave an analysis of some of the material that has been published on the issue and the relationship between suicide and abortion. I read that paper and many other papers with interest and I have some of them here. The only area in which there appears to be any common agreement in all of these papers is a surprising one. There is a conclusion in a paper by Louis Appleby on which there seems to be general agreement. The paper gives the conclusion that motherhood seems to protect against suicide. Concern for dependants may be an important focus for suicide prevention in clinical practice. However, the point may be made that it is not those who move in this direction that we should be considering, but those who are tempted or pressured to go in that direction. I believe the proper and appropriate method of dealing with threatened suicide is not abortion, the forcing of one trauma on top of another trauma for a woman. I believe that care, attention and nursing, and if necessary an expansion of psychiatric care, even in-house care, is what is required in that particular case. I am not a doctor and I am not qualified to give an opinion. The only answer I can get from an earnest and honest search in existing literature that I can produce from one of the universities is that there is great confusion and no general conclusion among the psychiatrists in either this city or on the international front. Another aspect of the contribution from Fine Gael which I had hoped to deal with at length but which I will now deal with briefly is the continuous reference back to 1982. I do not believe that [315] references back in history will serve any purpose. If there was culpability at that time it was shared. It is, after all, a historical fact that it was Deputy FitzGerald and the then Senator Hussey who first met the pro-life movement in April 1981. They gave an instant pledge without any proper consultation as to precisely where such a measure would lead. Deputy FitzGerald suggested last night that it is politically acceptable to move in one direction because your opponent is moving in that direction, but it was Deputy FitzGerald who initiated the movement in that direction. I do not say that Deputy FitzGerald was wrong. If there were cogent arguments which suggested there was going to be a constitutional threat to the life of unborn children he was probably right and he would be on the same side as I on that issue.;2626781

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Dick Roche;Fianna Fáil;I will conclude on this point. We should move away from this writing and rewriting of history. The reality is that it has nothing to do with this debate. We cannot change history, but we can learn from it. The debate in 1983 — during which there were many attempts by Deputies to tar each other — was one of the most disgraceful episodes in our democracy. I would hope that whatever views Deputies have, and I feel very strongly on one side of this issue, that they will not descend to the levels that were descended to at that time. For every argument about what happened in 1982 and 1983 that can be put forward by Fine Gael we could put forward a separate set of arguments. That is an amateurish and childish way of conducting debate and it has nothing to do [316] with the issue. I would hope in the balance of contributions from Fine Gael that they will address the issue and clarify where they stand. I believe Fine Gael are a very strong pro-life party and that there is a diversity of view within that party, as there is in Fianna Fáil. We should acknowledge that. I believe that at the end of the day the proposition being put to the people in this referendum is probably the best and the only way we can achieve what the people sought to achieve in 1983. At least we owe it to the people to offer them the choice of re-establishing where they stand on this issue by way of referendum.;2626785

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Roger Garland;Green Party;I thank Deputy Roche for sharing time. The abortion debate is a test of how we do things in the Dáil and how we address the many and complex issues we are trying to deal with in the very short space of four days. The abortion issue inevitably raises questions as to what extent, if at all, matters of this nature should be enshrined in our Consituation. What is the purpose of a Constitution? As I see it, the purpose of a Constitution is to enshrine the basic structure as to how we govern ourselves. It should deal with the courts and fundamental rights, and by and large our Constitution does this. The principle of having a written Constitution which cannot be altered by legislation but must be submitted to the people for approval is as it should be — the more we can involve the people the better. We must ask ourselves what we in Dáil Éireann should do to address the consequences of the Supreme Court decision on the X case. It is no understatement to say that this judgment came as a bombshell to those people who supported the referendum in 1983. In spite of expert legal advice which the supporters of this Amendment obtained, it did not stand up in the Supreme Court. There is no certainty that the Government's proposed Amendment or any Amendment thereof will pass the court's scrutiny. Therefore, I conclude that matters of this nature should not be put into the Constitution. This matter has [317] been further exacerbated by the decision of the Government to put a Protocol into the Maastricht Treaty. The fact that the Government are insisting in railroading this extremely complex and sensitive matter through the Dáil in four days is absolutely scandalous. The fact that the Report Stage of the Bill will be taken immediatley after the Committee Stage is extremely unsatisfactory. The style of the present Government is akin to a bull rushing at a gate. We saw exactly the same phenomenon when the Taoiseach insisted on holding the Maastricht Referendum to ratify a treaty which his own Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted to me in Dáil Éireann did not exist. This referendum was conducted at a huge cost to the people. There are people on both sides of this debate who maintain that the issues are very clear cut. I certainly do not subscribe to this simplistic attitude. This whole issue is extremely complex and quite unsuited to being dealt with in a few lines in our Constitution. I would remind the House that what the Government are trying to do in these Bills is to amend Article 40. 3.3º. It can be argued that there are already adequate safeguards in our Constitution dealing with the right to life of the unborn. Surely we should now have another look at Article 40. 3.3º. I do not think sufficient thought has been given to this matter. I had hoped at the beginning of this session that we could arrive at a consensus on this issue but this has not proved possible. I do not think we tried hard enough. As far as I can see, there is consensus in the House on the travel issue and near consensus on the information issue. There is a large measure of agreement throughout the country on these two issues and I will be supporting the wording in the two relevant Bills. However, on the substantive issue there is no consensus even on how the matter should be approached. I wish the Minister had accepted Deputy John Bruton's suggestion to postpone the debate on the substantive issue. This matter should be dealt with by legislation [318] followed by a referendum so that the people can have the last word. That is the exact opposite to what we are doing. I would argue that a strong case can be made to restore the citizens' initiative to our Constitution which was taken away from the people in 1937. I would have to argue that any form of yes or no answer to a question as complex as this is a very blunt instrument. The Green Party have always favoured the use of a preferendum, that is, a proposition given a number of different choices rather than a referendum, which by its nature has a simple yes or no answer. Indeed, this matter was adverted to in the correspondence columns of the newspapers recently when it was suggested that people be given four different proposals upon which legislation would be based. This again would be a considerable improvement on the confrontational politics that we are engaged in this week. Before I conclude I want to make it quite clear that it is the policy of the Green Party that when the life of the mother is threatened, then the mother must have full access to all necessary medical treatment. To summarise my views on the way forward, this is such an important and complex issue that we just cannot afford to make a mistake by rushing at it. We cannot afford another inadequate, inaccurate constitutional Amendment and must take proper care to ensure that what we do in this House will stand the test of time and the scrutiny of the Supreme Court.;2626786
970;Private Members' Business. - An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East): There is widespread agreement on the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, so I will be addressing myself to the Twelfth Amendment. I have believed since I first gave serious consideration to the issue of abortion that the Constitution is not the best vehicle for legislation in respect of abortion. The prohibition on unlawful abortion contained in the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act prevented unlawful abortion in this country for 120 years. The 1983 pro-life amendment, which [319] according to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, 'was designed to preserve the prohibition on unlawful abortion contained in the 1861 Act', fell at the first fence in the first legal challenge on the substantive issue in the X case earlier this year. It seems that the statutory prohibition in the 1861 Act was more effective than the constitutional prohibition introduced in 1983. The Constitution means whatever the Supreme Court decides it means at any time, so clearly we can never be absolutely certain what any Amendment to the Constitution means when framed, debated, passed by this House and endorsed by the people. This is particularly so as the Supreme Court, especially since the sixties, has regarded the Constitution as an organic document which must be interpreted in its totality. They also expect it to be interpreted in the light of the circumstances of the times in which the interpretation is made. It must also be interpreted in accordance with the preamble to the Constitution. In the course of his judgment in McGee v. The Attorney General, 1974, Mr. Justice Walsh stated as follows: In this country, it falls finally upon the judges to interpret the Constitution and in doing so to determine, where necessary, the rights which are superior or antecedent to positive law or which are imprescriptible or inalienable. In the performance of this difficult duty there are certain guidelines laid down in the Constitution for a judge. The very structure and content of the Articles dealing with fundamental rights clearly indicate that justice is not subordinate to the law. In particular, the terms of Section 3 in Article 40 expressly subordinate the law to justice. Both Aristotle and the Christian philosophers have regarded justice as the highest human virtue. The virtue of prudence was also esteemed by Aristotle, as by the philosophers of the Christian world. But the great additional virtue introduced by Christianity was that of charity —[320] not the charity which consists of giving to the deserving for that is justice, but the charity which is also called mercy. According to the Preamble, the People gave themselves the Constitution to promote the common good, with due observance to prudence, justice and charity so that the dignity and freedom of the individual might be assured. The judges must, therefore, as best they can from their training and experience, interpret these rights in accordance with their ideas of prudence, justice and charity. It is but natural that from time to time the prevailing ideas of these virtues may be conditioned by the passage of time no interpetation of the Constitution is intended to be final for all time. It is given in the light of prevailing ideas and concepts. It is worth asking, how a Minister for Justice can give such guarantees to this House as to the certainty of how words can be interpreted when one of the principle advocates of the type of constitutional interpretation we now have, has spoken as I have quoted? Subsequently, in the course of his judgment in the State (Healy) v. O'Donoghue in 1976 in the Irish Reports at page 374, Chief Justice O'Higgins spoke as follows: The Preamble to the Constitution records that the People seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of prudence, justice and charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored and concord established with other nations, do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution. In my view, this Preamble makes it clear that rights given by the Constitution must be considered in accordance with concepts of prudence, justice and charity, which may gradually change or develop as society changes and develops, and which fall to be interpreted from time to time in accordance with prevailing ideas. The Preamble envisages a Constitution [321] which can absorb or be adapted to such changes. In other words, the Constitution did not seek to impose for all time the ideas prevalent or accepted with regard to these virtues at the time of its enactment. That is worth repeating. Justice O'Higgins the former Chief Justice talks about interpreting the Constitution in accordance with the virtues of prudence, justice and charity which are laid out in the Preamble, but then he says that this interpretation may gradually change and develop as society changes and develops and will fall to be interpreted from time to time in accordance with the prevailing ideas. After reading that quotation it is worth asking how the present Minister for Justice can give guarantees in this House as to what any form of words inserted in the Constitution will mean, when it is up to the Supreme Court to decide in accordance with the Preamble to the Constitution in a changing society what the words mean at any time in any test case. If Deputies and members of the public would only take on board the clearly stated views of several Supreme Court judges, they would find no difficulty in explaining the dichotomy between what the people thought they were voting for in 1983 and what the judges decided in the X case almost ten years later, because that is the way constitutional interpretations are made, and that is the way they have to be made, according to these eminent jurists, to be consistent with the organic nature of the Constitution and arising from the Preamble to the Constitution itself.' Chief Justice Finlay referred with approval to those quotations and actually incorporated them in the X judgment when he made it clear that he was following the same approach. It is quite clear therefore that it is not possible to pin down the Supreme Court in advance to a particular interpretation of words in the Constitution, and to attempt to do so is futile because our Supreme Court since the late sixties has exactly the same notion of their interpreting function with regard to the Constitution as the [322] Supreme Court in the US has, and they will interpret it as society changes in the light of prevailing circumstances against the background of the Preamble and in the light of the virtues of prudence, justice and charity. They thought it was just to lift the injunction on Miss X and they thought it was the charitable thing to do. That is why they made the decision. I put it to the Minister for Justice that it is not possible to give the kind of guarantees which the Minister gave in this House and which he gave from these Opposition benches in 1983, or to say with any certitude what way words in the Constitution may be interpreted in two years' time, in ten years' time or in thirty years' time. As a matter of fact the Supreme Court adjudicated on Articles 40. 3.3º on three separate occasions, and with respect to the honourable members of the court their judgments have not been consistent. The earlier judgments were closer to the view of those who proposed the 1983 amendment. The judgment in respect of the provision of information was nearer to the stated position in the 1983 judgment than the judgment in the X case. The underlying attitude of the same judges changed over a very short period when faced with the harrowing circumstances of the Miss X case. In accordance with the concepts of prudcence, justice and charity they lifted the injunction placed by the High Court on Miss X. This change of position by the learned judges adds further force to the argument that those who believe that words in the Constitution will give certainty on abortion are suffering from a dangerous form of self-delusion. A constitutional amendment can set out the basic principle on which law should be founded it takes detailed legislation to give certainty to the law. When I was Minister for Justice in 1983, I listened to the views of many Deputies still in this House in the course of the debate on the amendment which became Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. I recall in particular, Deputies Woods, Geoghegan-Quinn and Flynn who were [323] the leading lights of Fianna Fáil in that debate. Deputy Flynn expounded with absolute certainty on both constitutional law and medical practice, and gave assurances to all and sundry that neither a future Oireachtas, nor a future Supreme Court could possibly allow abortion in this jurisdiction, once the then amendment was passed. He was wrong on both counts. The Supreme Court earlier this year decided that abortion was permitted in certain circumstances, and now the Minister, Deputy Flynn, is introducing an amendment on behalf of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats which, on his own admission, will permit abortion to save a mother's life. The Minister's assurances were so wrong in 1983 that one must regard similar assurances given by the Minister for Justice yesterday with awe and a mixture of fear and wonder. Only a man with the ego of the Minister could give the kind of assurances the Minister gave yesterday after being so wrong in 1983. It is not possible for the Minister to give such assurances. The Minister is once more proposing to put a riddle into the Constitution and the Supreme Court will answer the riddle some time in the future and the Minister has no certainty as to what the answer will be any more than he did in 1983. To put it bluntly, the form of words that has been proposed in respect of the substantive issue is ambiguous and unless the Government introduce legislation to give a statutory framework to their constitutional intentions, neither the medical profession, the mothers of Ireland nor anyone else will know where they stand. It is a striking contradiction that the Minister for Justice will not proceed to a constitutional amendment on divorce until he has published legislation setting out the detailed grounds for his proposal. Yet he believes he should amend the Constitution in respect of abortion without publishing any legislation and he shamelessly maintains that no such legislation will be necessary in the future, despite the explicit advice of the [324] Attorney General that such legislation is necessary. That is an astounding contradiction compounded by the fact that it goes in the face of the Attorney General's advice. I would like now to turn to the wording of the Twelfth Amendment. The Government's intention seems to be to enshrine in the Constitution the judgment of the Supreme Court in so far as it dealt with the circumstances in which it would be lawful to terminate the life of an unborn child where the mother's life is at real and substantial risk from causes other than an intention to commit suicide. That, I think, is a fair presentation of the Government's intention. A judgment of the Supreme Court in a constitutional case quite clearly has a constitutional effect. In simple terms the judgment explains or amplifies a part of the Constitution and it has the same force in law as if it was actually part of the Constitution. Article 40. 3.3º was ambiguous. It was not clear how the right to life of a mother and the right to life of an unborn child should be balanced when those two rights were in conflict. The judgment in the X case adjudicated on this matter and the constitutional position now is that abortion is lawful when it is necessary to save the life of the mother when there is a real and substantial risk to her life, including a risk of self destruction. If it is the intention of the Government to maintain that position but to rule out the grounds of suicide, why does the Minister think it necessary to introduce several lines of ambiguous language into the Constitution when the Supreme Court had already adjudicated on the matter and cleared up the ambiguity? Would the Government's purpose not have been better served if their amendment simply excluded suicide as a ground for abortion and allowed the Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 40. 3.3º to stand where they had adjudicated between the conflicting rights of a mother and an unborn child? By proposing the form of words now before us the Government are proposing to restore the ambiguity which the Supreme Court had taken [325] out of the Constitution in their judgment in the X case and we will not now know what the position is until a future case comes before the Supreme Court. I listened with interest to the reasons given by the Minister for Justice for including the phrase 'as distinct from the health' in the amendment. In essence he claims that if this phrase were not included abortion would be available on broad health grounds as well as on life grounds and that this would lead inevitably to widespread abortion in Ireland. Again I do not think I am misstating his case. That is exactly his position. It is worth repeating. He claims that if the phrase 'as distinct from the health' is not included abortion would be available on broad health grounds as well as on life grounds and that this would lead inevitably to widespread abortion in Ireland. The Minister claims that he sees parallels with the Bourne v. R case in the United Kingdom in 1938 and expressed a fear that if the phrase is not included the word 'life' will be interpreted as the quality of life and that this will lead to abortion on demand. I do not believe the Minister is correct in this interpretation. First of all, on parallels he sees with the Bourne case, which were commented on by other speakers tonight, it is worth pointing out that there is no written constitution in the United Kingdom. In our Constitution the unenumerated right to life of the unborn gave protection to the unborn even before Article 40. 3.3º was inserted in the Constitution. It was the view expressed to me by Supreme Court judges in 1983 that the legal position, the constitutional position, was not changed by Article 40. 3.3º but that simply what was an unenumerated right in Article 40, the right to life of the unborn, was made an explicit right by its insertion in the Constitution. Mr. Justice Flaherty, in his judgment on the X case, stated clearly that Article 40. 3.3º would prevent abortion on demand and that any Act of this Parliament to introduce anything that came near abortion on demand would fall on constitutional grounds because of Article 40. 3.3º. Therefore I do not see the parallels with the Bourne case. They [326] do not have a written constitution in the United Kingdom and the particular law had such strong force in precedent that it led in a direction that we all know about now. That is not the position here. I believe that the phrase in question adds nothing to the meaning of the words. If, for example, I were to say that it was the Ceann Comhairle as distinct from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who made a decision, the phrase 'as distinct from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle' would merely clarify the main statement but would add nothing to the substance. If I say it was Deputy Byrne as distinct from Deputy De Rossa who made the fine speech in the House, the phrase 'as distinct from Deputy De Rossa' is only a clarifier. It certainly makes it easier to understand the substantive point in the principal statement, but it does not change the meaning of the substantive point in the principal statement. It adds nothing of substance, in my view. Likewise, the test in the amendment, without that phrase being inserted, that termination be necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is at real and substantial risk is a sufficiently rigid test to confine termination to life grounds rather than health grounds. The inclusion of the phrase — and this, to answer Deputy Roche's point, is the net point of our objection — puts the medical profession in a very difficult position. I believe it was a difficulty that was clearly understood by the people who drafted the speech of the Minister for Justice because I think it was as clear as crystal from the explanations they gave that they understood the difficulty and were worried about it. There is no absolute frontier over which one crosses from a health threatening situation to a life threatening situation. A doctor must make the best possible judgment he can in the interests of his patients, but it is naive to believe that he can apply some kind of measuring scale to say 'The threat is now to health, so I cannot' and then to say 'The threat is now to life, so I can'. There is no yardstick, there is no ruler, there is no set of logarithm tables one can apply to say that [327] at a precise point in the course of an illness a patient has passed from a situation where the condition is health threatening into a situation where it is life threatening. By including 'as distinct from the health' in the wording the Minister establishes a false criterion for doctors and introduces the fear of litigation into what is essentially a medical decision. If we set up a false standard with no basis in reality, a doctor making a decision is on the one hand, open to litigation from the next of kin of a patient who dies, on the grounds that he did not intervene in time as the illness progressed but on the other hand if he intervenes too soon and the life of a foetus is lost, he again faces the possibility of litigation from, say, a mother or a husband who wanted a live and well child. Deputy Roche asked me to explain precisely what our difficulty was. I cannot do better than to give back to him what Deputy Lenihan said earlier in the House, because I think he put it very well indeed. He said that when illnesses are grave — and we have all heard the expression that somebody is gravely ill — there is a spectrum of gravity and it is not possible to say in that spectrum of gravity at what point one crosses from a health threatening situation into a life threatening situation. That was the point Deputy Lenihan made so well this afternoon and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party should think about it. The amendment which is being proposed would have wide support if the phrase 'as distinct from the health' was omitted. Even if the Minister is correct, it is possible to envisage a future Supreme Court deciding that life means something more than biological life. Some jurisdictions allow abortion because the adverse economic and social circumstances of a mother justify it under their Statutes. In those circumstances abortion is allowed on grounds related to the quality of life but the adverse quality of the mother's life does not arise from ill-health and if we take the Minister at his word the only thing that he is pinning down is the question of ill-health. Other [328] quality of life interpretations do not arise from the question of health but rather from general economic and social conditions. In other jurisdictions abortion is permissible on those grounds. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a future Supreme Court would interpret this phrase in that way. The phrase 'as distinct from the health' does not meet this problem. The Roe v. Wade case in the United States — this test case led to widespread abortion in that jurisdiction — did not rely on health grounds but rather on concepts of privacy of the individual and the bodily integrity of the mother. It is not too far fetched to believe that at some future date such concepts could be imported into a Supreme Court judgment which sought to unravel the ambiguous wording now being proposed for inclusion in the Constitution. The Minister should introduce a Bill to prevent widespread abortion and he should not duck his responsibilities and transfer what is properly the function of the Oireachtas to the Supreme Court. The stated intention of the Government to introduce legislation to enshrine the totality of the Supreme Court judgment in law if their amendment is defeated is the most extraordinary aspect of the affair. The Government are opposed to abortion except in limited circumstances to save the life of the mother. Yet, the same Government, if they do not get their way, are committed to introducing legislation which, according to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, will provide for abortion on demand. That is the most outrageous proposal in this process. It is an immoral and amoral position and it is spectacular in its rashness. It is also an idle threat because the Government know that they have no hope of getting that type of legislation through this House or the Seanad. I find the position of the Progressive Democrats in this debate beyond comprehension. The right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights and the constitutional amendment on the substantive issue is founded directly on the right to life even if it qualifies that right [329] in respect of the unborn child of a mother whose life is at real and substantial risk. On this most fundamental of issues the Progressive Democrats have two contradictory positions — they will support the amendment in the Dáil and will oppose it in the referendum. This approach surely raises expediency to the level of an art form. I strongly support the right to life of the unborn but believe that there are limited circumstances in which that right is in conflict with the right to life of the mother and in those circumstances a doctor must be in a position to make a decision in favour of the mother. I do not believe that a constitutional amendment alone with all its ambiguity will achieve this end. Only legislation will give the certainty to the law which is necessary to protect the life of the unborn child only legislation will give certainty to the law which is necessary to protect the life of the mother and only legislation will give protection to members of the medical profession who have to make a decision when the right to life of the mother and child are in direct conflict. Constitutional amendments are blunt instruments and in the absence of Statute law they will not achieve what their proposers intend. The Minister should withdraw this Bill until he has published appropriate accompanying legislation.;2626787
971;Private Members' Business. - An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;The circumstances in which the termination of pregnancy is permissible is an inherently complex issue not susceptible to a single sentence formula. By concentrating their efforts during the past six months on an attmept to find a single magical legal sentence the Government have embarked upon a search which is doomed to failure. The single sentence solution, compressing all the complications of the issue into just 50 words or so, simply does not exist. The experience of the 1983 amendment, if it teaches us anything, shows that we cannot depend on a single sentence solution because every single sentence solution is likely to carry within it the seeds of uncertainty, the need for [330] further judicial interpretation and critical terms left undefined. The real tragedy of the Government's approach is that it is unnecessary to force the electorate as this amendment does, if it goes through in its present form, to guess, guesstimate or take a chance on what the sentence will actually mean when the Supreme Court Court comes to interpret it. It is unnecessary to force the electorate, unfairly, to select between competing and conflicting legal assertions in this House as to what the actual effect or real meaning of the Government's formula will be. The very existence in this House of doubt and debate about the meaning of the various words shows that we should stop this process now and choose a different course. Do the Government seriously think that the debate about the wording, its meaning and effect which has gone on inside and outside the House during the past 15 days or so is going to stop next week? The inescapable truth of this matter is that this debate is certain to be taken up again but this time in a court of law and the outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted with confidence by anyone, including the Minister for Justice. The proffering of a formula involving that level of uncertainty represents a grave failure of leadership. The effect of the Bill is to offer a choice between two bad options. Neither a Yes nor a No vote will resolve this issue definitively and none of this is necessary. Instead the solution is to start with comprehensive legislation which spells out at whatever length is necessary the solution to the issue leaving nothing to guesswork or to the uncertainty of future judicial interpretation. The constitutional provision should then be founded on that detailed legislation. The Government should introduce such legislation before attempting to enact their constitutional amendment setting out the circumstances in which a termination of a pregnancy will be lawful in Ireland. We are dealing here with matters of life and death. It does not seem to make any sense to deal exclusively with matters [331] of that gravity in 55 words in a Constitution or in any other document. To rely solely on 55 words to encompass all the complexities of conflicting rights to life is imprudent to say the least. We should not forget that at a practical level those 55 words are the basis on which, unfortunately, patients may go to law against their doctors and even children may go to law against their parents. Let me give a practical example of this. Let us suppose that a pregnant woman is treated for cancer by chemotherapy and that in the course of treatment her child is damaged seriously but is born alive. We could then have a situation in which the child might sue either its mother or, more likely, its mother's doctor on the claim that the chemotherapy in this circumstance was only necessary to protect the health and not necessarily to protect the life of the mother. How and on what basis would liability be decided in this case? Obviously, it would be decided on the basis of an interpretation by the court in this civil action of the precise meaning of the words that the Government now want to put into the Constitution. I know it will be argued that such an action is highly unlikely but if one thinks about it it is not all that unlikely. Given the substantial costs involved in maintaining a child whose health has been severely damaged because of chemotherapy applied to his mother while still in the womb an action for compensatory damages is not at all unlikely. It is not enough to say that it is a matter for the doctors to work out the legal liabilities in that situation. Doctors may have experience of making split second clinical decisions based on an understanding of their legal liabilities in regard to existing medical practice based on well established codes of ethics and case law but they are not used to and have no experience of making split second clinical decisions on the basis of an interpretation as yet uncertain of a new and totally untested constitution provision of 55 words which the Government want to insert. This problem for doctors which, ultimately, [332] will affect the way women are treated because uncertainty will either lead to over-treatment, postponed treatment or treatment that is not necessarily the best for the mother and her child could be avoided if we were to first enact legislation which would clarify all the procedures for determining liability in cases like this before we put any words into the Constitution. It might well emerge in the course of preparing such legislation that certain alterations in the proposed consitutional wording would remove many of the practical difficulties to which I have referred. However, if we put the words into the Constitution first before we discuss the practical legislation it will be too late to make any adjustments afterwards without having another referendum. Let me give another example of why we should have the legislation before a referendum. This constitutional provision will create a constitutional right, in certain circumstances, to a termination of a pregnancy. There may well be, and I am sure there are, some doctors who would have a conscientious objection to performing a termination even in these limited circumstances. Given the gravity of the issues involved, this is to be expected. The Dáil, when in 1979 it was enacting legislation to legalise contraception, which does not raise ethical issues of the same gravity, inserted a clause to cater for such conscientious objectors. A similar clause is needed in this case to cater for conscientious objectors who may not wish to provide a service for which this provision will create a constitutional right. Yet there is no such clause in the Constitution and the Taoiseach says we need no legislation to provide for it. In my view we should first have the legislation to deal with conscientious objectors. In discussing that legislation we would throw light on what the appropriate words should be that would ultimately be inserted in the Constitution. In other words, we should put the horse before the cart. Any difficult issues that came up in the course of discussion of the question of conscientious objectors could then be taken into account in the choice [333] of the precise words to be used in the Constitution. There is another very telling argument for having legislation first. This is to be found in the excellent judgment of the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy in the X case. He was referring to the decision of Dáil Éireann to allow the original 1983 amendment to be a full and final statement of the legal position in regard to abortion here, without any supplementary legislation to explain or underpin its real meaning. He said: 'In the context of the eight years that have passed since the amendment was adopted the failure of the Legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate, it is inexcusable'. There has never been as trenchant a condemnation of the Houses of the Oireachtas from the courts as that uttered by Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy on that occasion. Yet it seems that we will probably have to wait another eight years for another Supreme Court judge to make exactly the same condemnation of our failure to enact legislation in regard to the interpretation and implementation of this amendment. Mr. Justice McCarthy went on to ask the question in regard to the statement in the 1983 amendment that the State by its laws would, as far as practicable, vindicate the right to life of the unborn, as to how in practice the State would do this. He drew the conclusion that if the State was in fact to vindicate the right to life of the unborn, it had no option but to do so by positive legislation. He said: Legislation may be both negative and positive. Negative in prohibiting abortion, absolutely, or at a given time or without meeting stringent tests. Positive by requiring positive action. The State may fulfil its positive role by providing the necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort, to plan for the pregnant woman. Mr. Justice McCarthy thus made it abundantly clear that it was his view that the State had two obligations. Certainly it had an obligation to prohibit abortion, but it also had an obligation to prevent the cause of abortion arising by providing [334] the necessary help for women who became pregnant. He made it abundantly clear that he believed that this positive role was one that should be met by legislation. The Government plan no such legislation. This is a very important matter that should be addressed by legislation before we amend the Constitution. There is yet another area which needs to be dealt with by legislation before we consider the constitutional amendment proposed by the Government. The Government's amendment says that termination of pregnancy is lawful in stated circumstances, but it does not say how late in the pregnancy such termination is permissible. It seems that this is a matter that should be addressed by legislation before we enact any such constitutional amendment. Let me refer to yet another reason for having legislation first. The Government have chosen, in my view mistakenly, to use the words 'life, as distinct from health' in the wording they are putting forward. Almost all the medical people I have spoken to regard the addition of the words 'as distinct from the health' as adding nothing to either the meaning or the clarity of the remaining wording in the amendment. It is quite clear from the remaining wording that it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother. The remaining words have a clear, simple, meaning regardless of whether we add the words 'as distinct from the health' as well. I have found nobody in either medical or legal circles who agrees with the truly amazing and scaremongering assertion of the Minister for Justice that if the words 'as distinct from the health' are omitted, this might eventually lead to abortion on demand. The only argument the Minister advanced for this assertion was by reference to the Bourne case in England in 1938. I submit that this is an argument that has no foundation. The Bourne case was decided in a country where there is no written constitution, and where there is no constitutional guarantee of any kind of the right to life of the unborn. To [335] suggest that the Irish Supreme Court would make an interpretation along the lines of the Bourne case runs counter to the entire trend of constitutional interpretation in this State. In any event, if the Minister cared to read the Bourne judgment carefully he would find that the test applied in that case was not one that concerned health grounds alone. Mr. Justice McNaughton said in his judgment that the question that had to be decided was whether the jury was satisfied that the termination was performed in good faith for the purposes of preserving the life of the girl — I emphasise that Mr. Justice McNaughton used the word 'life', not the word 'health'. In any event if the Minister has doubts about the practical interpretation of the amendment in the Constitution without the words 'as distinct from the health', surely the sensible thing for him to do would be to introduce legislation first, setting out in detail what shall be the criteria used and how these will be applied in practice, and have them approved in the House before enacting a constitutional provision. The doubt the Minister was trying to sow as to what would happen if these words were left out is in itself an argument for having legislation first, to clear up doubts of that kind. By putting the words 'as distinct from the health' into the Constitution the Minister is creating an entirely needless and indeterminable area of legal doubt which will cotinue for years. Furthermore, the Constitution is not just a legal document, it is a document for our people. A reference of this kind which seems to place the health of women in a subordinate position, quite unnecessarily in my view, means that many women will feel that the Constitution does not speak for them. That undermines the respect for the Constitution. I would like to elborate on the doubt that is being created. Let us assume that a medical team is involved in the performance of an operation on a pregnant woman and one member of the team feels that the woman's condition is life-threatening [336] but another feels that it is only health-threatening. Let us assume that the member of the medical team who feels it is health-threatening discusses it casually with a third party and this third party feels it is his or her duty to report this dilemma to the Attorney General. Will we have a situation where the Attorney General will feel obliged to seek an injunction on the grounds that the courts — not the medical team — should determine whether a condition is 'health threatening' or 'life threatening'?;2626788

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;I will hardly finish my speech in that time. If we had legislation first, the procedures for deciding such cases of conflict could be worked out in detail in advance. The area of doubt and argument could be greatly reduced. The likelihood of recourse to the courts could be reduced or eliminated. Let me advance a further argument for having legislation first. Ireland is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. It does not matter what is in our Constitution, the European Court of Human Rights can overturn it. The European Court of Human Rights takes the view that the fundamental rights and freedoms contained in the convention are superior to the written Constitution of any signatory State. If the European Court of European Rights decides that a provision in the Constitution of a signatory State is repugnant to the Convention, any citizen of that State who feels that their rights have been infringed by it, can sue their Government to have their rights vindicated, and will succeed in that action. I believe that it is much less likely that Ireland's law on this subject could be successfully challenged in the European Court of Human Rights if our law is set out in detail in legislation, not solely in the Constitution. If we want to have a law in this country that endures, and is [337] not set aside in Europe, then we should have legislation first to underpin our ultimate constitutional provision and not rely solely on it. Having said all this, I do not go along with those who argue that the right to life of the unborn should not be guaranteed in the Constitution. Whether we like it or not, our Constitution is one that guarantees all sorts of rights to all sorts of people. For example, our Constitution guarantees a right to the Government to absolute confidentiality of their proceedings, a bizarre concept — but one which apparently is founded on a particular interpretation of our Constitution. Our Constitution has also been the basis upon which our tax law as between spouses has been changed. These are all very important matters, but so also is the right to life of an unborn child. If tax law and Cabinet confidentiality is dealt with in the Constitution, then I cannot see why, after proper preparation, the other should not also be dealt with in the Constitution. However, if we are to provide constitutional rights for the unborn, it is my contention that we should do so on the basis of proper preparation based on having detailed legislation first. We also have a practical situation that arises in regard to the present issue. In the X case, the Supreme Court decided that there was a right to abortion on the basis of intention to commit suicide. Admittedly, it decided this in a very extreme case of a 14 year old who had been raped, but the general principle is one that could be extended in subsequent case law, to encompass other less traumatic circumstances. Given that the Supreme Court made that decision on the basis of an interpretation of the existing Constitution, it seems to me that it is not possible to alter that interpretation, other than by an Amendment to the Constitution itself. Any such Amendment to the Constitution should be carefully prepared on the basis of legislation that has first been debated, and not made solely by insertion of a brief phrase of six words inserted in the Constitution, without any accompanying legislation. [338] It is my strong view that allowing suicide as a general ground for abortion would lead gradually to fairly widespread abortion. Some believe that one can avoid this by legislating, within the Supreme Court decision, to limit the suicide exception so that it will only apply to very extreme cases. While this may be the intention of the framers of such legislation, it is not necessarily what would turn out in practice when such legislation had been in force for a few years. Presumably, any such legislation introduced would provide that psychiatrists and/or psychologists would have to verify that the suicidal intention was genuine. The only psychiatrist I had the opportunity to consult expressed the view that a psychiatrist would have immense difficulty in certifying in such a case. It is quite difficult to envisage the type of evidence that could be produced to justify denial of a claim that a person was suicidal. If a particular psychiatrist decided to take a risk, and certify that a person was not suicidal, and if in one case out of a 100 their judgment proved incorrect, pressure on them would be quite considerable. Doctor Paul O'Mahony argued in The Irish Times today: The ethics of professional practice would dictate that one would always err on the side of caution, finding that the woman was at real risk of suicide, even when the underlying evidence could not fully support this...The role envisaged for psychiatrists and psychologists if the amendment is rejected is, then inherently conflicted. It both invests them with powers of diagnosis and assessment that they do not have, and places an intolerable burden of responsibility on their shoulders. I know that other psychiatrists have taken a different view. I have read a study by Professor Anthony Clare and Dr. Tyrrell on this subject. They cite a study undertaken at the University of Rochester in New York State during the period 1963-69 when, of 108 women referred to for [339] psychiatric evaluation for abortion, 60 were refused. I have no doubt that this evidence is correct but I believe that the psychiatric evaluation in this case did not relate to a direct threat of suicide, but to a much less fraught decision in regard to general mental health. The same pressure to err on the side of caution, in the words of Dr. O'Mahony, would not have applied in that case, as it would if one was judging suicidal intention. There are broad ethical questions to be considered about the nature of a decision to commit suicide, and the degree of responsibility involved in such a decision. It seems there is divergence of opinion on this subject and I recognise that there are others who do not agree with my view on it. This divergence underlines yet again the need to have legislation first, before we attempt a constitutional amendment. I am confident that the discussion of the legislation would convince people that there is a need for a constitutional amendment to alter that aspect of the Supreme Court decision. I am confident that such a constitutional amendment would be introduced with much greater ease, sense of assurance and mutual tolerance if it had followed a proper debate on legislation than if it is rushed through in six words as the Government wish to do today.;2626790

Many are dependent on a clear debate to assist them with their comprehension of the issue. I am concerned that, in many respects, there has not been clarity of debate we have a duty to try to give that to the people because it is a very complex issue, as we are all aware. It is unfortunate and unfair to attempt — as some speakers from the Opposition have — to enter the realms of scaremongering. I am surprised at some of the sentiments expressed and the issues raised because the debate is very important and relates to people's concerns and worries. People do not need [340] scaremongering tactics or the Opposition to approach this debate as just another discussion and decide to be negative.;2626791

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;F;Ms. Mary Wallace;Fianna Fáil;I have been very surprised at some of the things I heard today. For example, Deputy Owen, who I know has sincerely and deeply felt convictions about these amendments — which I respect — raised unacceptable issues. She accused Fianna Fáil and their representatives of deliberately seeking to undermine the rights of Irish women and of knowingly seeking to endanger their health. She also said that we were an unscrupulous party who have a lack of respect for Irish people and that we seemed to be engaged in a childish game. We cannot accept that. As a member of Fianna Fáil, a supporter of the Government and a woman, I could not accept the kind of allegations flung across the Floor of the House. I am disappointed because I thought we would have a fair and honest debate, which we owe to the people. Some speakers were not fair or balanced in their remarks. I reject the allegations, particularly suggestions that I, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, would be engaged in trying to undermine my own rights. I commend the Government for the effort made initially to try to keep the debate on a non-partisan level. Unfortunately, these efforts seem to have come to nought. It is regrettable that the Opposition resorted to the tactics which they used on this issue. Such tactics would be reasonable in relation to other issues — it is reasonable to attack the Government, that is what Opposition is about — but it was wrong in regard to the issue under debate. The Government were attacked in regard to their good faith and integrity, which did not do a service to the people. Interestingly, when I speak to people in my constituency I find that they want clarity in the wording and as regards what they will specifically be voting for on 3 December. They do not need any additional confusion, they need clarity. [341] Deputy John Bruton was anxious that legislation should be enacted before a referendum. I am opposed to that. I am very pleased that it is being referred to the people, particularly on the substantive issue. I believe that the wording presented in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution Bill is the best wording available. If there were better wording available I certainly would be one of the Members on this side of the House most anxious to examine all available wording in relation to the issue before us. I am very strongly in support of the Government's decision to refer this issue to the people, particularly in relation to the substantive issue. It has been suggested that abortion is too divisive a topic to be suitable for a referendum and that only by legislation could the issue be dealt with reasonably. I unequivocally believe that this is one of those fundamental issues on which not only do we have a duty to consult the people but also the people have the right to be consulted. Further, I point out that abortion is no less divisive an issue in America or in Germany as a result of the Legislature and the Judiciary in these countries making all of their laws in relation to abortion. If we are to live up to the principle that the people are sovereign and have the right to be consulted on determining the basic laws of this State we must refer this issue, above all issues, to the people and I am glad that we are doing so. I believe that it is right to reaffirm the principle that unborn children should be afforded definite protection and that abortion on demand is wrong. It has been an experience of other countries that the original intent of legislation has been distorted, opening the door to abortion on demand. I also believe that every woman should be guaranteed that she can receive in Ireland whatever treatment is necessary to resolve life-threatening medical conditions. A large part of the debate in the House and in the country as a whole has focussed on the phrase that is meant to address that aspect, the phrase 'as distinct from the health of.' I recognise [342] the way in which that phrase could be thought of as being very bald. Indeed, when initially giving consideration to the wording myself, I felt that the phrase was very bald. However, to date I have heard no satisfactory alternative that would ensure that abortion on demand could not come into Ireland. That is why the phrase is there. Having studied closely the various opinions advanced on the amendment, I am satisfied that should I become pregnant or should I develop a medical condition that posed a risk to my life, I would not be denied any necessary treatment because of the words contained in this amendment — and that is a very important feature for women. There should be no attempt to confuse that issue. The intent in that connection is very clear. In essence, as I understand it, the Government wording endeavours to close the door to abortion on demand in Ireland while ensuring that all treatments necessary to save the life of the mother will be allowed. On that basis, I support the referral of the proposed amendment to the people and I hope that they will vote for it. Further, I hope that every Member of the House will endeavour to make sure that the debate between now and polling day will not become marred in vitriolic, simplistic or partisan argument because the issue is much too serious for that. A Cheann Comhairle, I hope you will forgive me but I should have asked at the beginning of my contribution whether it would be in order for me to share time with my colleague, Deputy Coughlan.;2626793

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;F;Ms. Mary Coughlan;Fianna Fáil;Individual women will be affected at a particularly vulnerable and difficult time in their lives. I am very much in touch with the people of Donegal. It is my business to be in touch with them and to listen to what they have to say. In the past months I have been hearing a very clear message — the people of Donegal want a referendum on this issue. I do not think that the people of Donegal are any aberration either, many people in many parts of the country want a referendum. I believe that it is not just the people who are taking a narrow pro-life stance who want an opportunity to voice their opinion on this issue. It is my belief that the bulk of people do not want abortion in this country and that any measure introduced by any Government that looked as if it would introduce abortion to this country would cause the people grave concern. This means that the public do not want left in place the present position, whereby Ireland has one of the most liberal abortion regimes in Europe. Not only that, there is also the potential of expansion to include increasingly wider grounds, especially if some of the Members of the Opposition parties ever got into power. My constituents, therefore, want the Government to do something about this scenario. They want an approach that is effective and humane and that clearly indicates respect for women and a concern for women. Outside the House people are happy that Fianna Fáil are striking a compassionate balance between a position in which we have or could have a broad-based abortion regime and a position in which only the most rigid absolutist moral stance was enshrined in the Constitution. The Fianna Fáil amendment presents the people of Ireland with an approach that is humane, compassionate and protective [344] of women but is also protective of the values of the society in which we live. Before moving on to the substantive issue, I should like to speak to the amendment in relation to travel. For many of us the memories of 1983, although mentioned often in the House — and even just a few minutes ago — are not as vivid as they are for others. However, for all of us in the House and outside it, we never want a repeat of the memories of last spring, when we found this christian, humane country branded internationally as an island which imprisoned its women. We made headlines throughout the world because we were denying a fundamental human right to one of our young citizens, the right to travel. I am happy that the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution should and will be passed by the Irish people, because none of us wishes to restrict the free movement of people within or outside our country. As far as the right to information is concerned, as the Minister pointed out to the House earlier, there is a case before the European Court of Human Rights at present and the decision of the court will be before us in a number of weeks. However, that decision should not affect the amendment, in relation to the provision of information, that the Government are putting before the people on 3 December. That amendment would enshrine in the Constitution the right to receive and to give information, subject to conditions laid down by law. Directive counselling would not be allowed, whereas non-directive counselling would be allowed. Inevitably, it will be very difficult to draw absolutely clear guidelines between directive and non-directive counselling but certainly the intention of the amendment is to rule out systematic guidance, advice and, ultimately, abortion referral. In this country we have a wonderful tradition of committed medical care, with the skills and the knowledge to ensure that that care grows in sophistication with every passing year. Quite frankly, however, it is dangerous to assume that current medical practice in every single part of Ireland, in every single hospital, [345] reassures women in circumstances in which they have a concern about a risk to their lives that every medical procedure would be taken in their interests and at a time that would most protect their lives. I know that the amendment before us will ensure that women have those absolute rights. There has been much comment inside and outside the House that many of those speaking on this issue are men. That is a very fair point. Most of those talking on the issue in the House have been men and there has also been an age element. It is my generation of Irish women who will be most affected by the passage of this amendment. It is my generation who will face the choices, the terrors, the hopes and the challenges. The women of my generation have the right to believe that their lives are valued and that that value is expressed in the Constitution in a clear and unequivocal way. For me personally I want that protection which will be provided by the amendment. I want the entitlement to full and proper treatment which this amendment gives me. I want the freedom to travel and to have access to whatever information I want. As a citizen of this country, I have the right to all of those things. I have the right to something else also I have the right to know that we expressly protect the right to life of the unborn child. I know that the amendment in no way diminishes the protection afforded the unborn child by our Constitution. All of that is very clear because the Government have provided wording and an unambiguous public interpretation of that wording which can provide for all of those rights. In the past two days the Opposition have engaged in cheap shots on a life and death issue. They have called for the weirdest assortment of changes, postponements and tinkerings because they could not make up their own minds. Anyone who reads the contributions of the last day can be in no doubt that we have a national Parliament where the Government are prepared to take a stand to be honest with the people, to deal in a straightforward way with a hugely [346] sensitive issue and not to indulge in useless point scoring. Anyone who reads the contributions of the last day can also be in no doubt that we have an Opposition short on ideas, short on contributions and very short on vision, but with an infinite supply of vicious and emotive one-liners. Deputy Bruton spoke about single sentence solutions. I would not like to be waiting for him to come up with a single sentence solution. It is the same Members of the Opposition who are saying we should accomplish this task by legislation. You have got to be kidding — subjecting ourselves and our constituents to any more of this spectacle of people running away as fast as their little legs can carry them from any solution that addresses the substantive issue with courage and conviction. The people will decide on 3 December. I am confident that, in the interests of my own and future generations of women and in the interests of generations of children yet to be born, they will vote for the proposed wording.;2626797

Unfortunately, because of the lack of time, I must condense a 45 minute speech into ten minutes. Sadly, even to discuss the question of the termination of pregnancies, is for many Irish women today a most difficult and painful task. There is still a sizeable minority of people who, through shame, embarrassment or ignorance, find sex and sexual matters distasteful to talk about, let alone to address in an unemotional and clearheaded manner. We are a society which is still largely a [347] victim of a religious and of a Victorian ethos which viewed sex as something dirty. We are a society struggling to emerge into the real world of the 20th century, a world which many find far from perfect and far removed from the ideals and standards which many of us have tried to inculcate in others and in our own lifestyle. For many our society seems to be missing the essential core qualities such as respect, love, neighbourliness, understanding and forgiveness. Sadly, there are still a sizeable minority who would wish reproductive organs were confined to animals and that we did not possess them. If only it were true that children could be found, as in olden days, under cabbage heads, that they could really be delivered by the stork into a family, and that all births could be the result of a union other than by intercourse, then we would not have to address all these legal and medical complications which must be addressed when dealing with the sad realities of life in 1992 — for example, the sad reality of 5,000 of our citizens going to England to terminate their pregnancies. As legislators we cannot put our heads in the sand and ignore the reality of life in Ireland in the nineties. Legislators cannot be divorced from the real world. Legislators must make laws in the light of their own experiences and by recognising the complex nature of society as it is today. We must legislate not only for the few votes — that seems to be the Fianna Fáil approach to these referenda — or for the majority, but we must legislate for minorities or practices which we ourselves may not wish to avail of. We cannot and should not be selfish. If democracy means anything it must mean that as a society we must be egalitarian enough to live alongside and among people whose religious and moral standards and sexual lifestyles are different from our own. I cannot help but think how this charade in the House is being viewed by the religious minorities, not only in the Republic but particularly — in the light of the talks taking place to bring about a peaceful solution to the [348] murderous conflict in Northern Ireland — by the Protestant majority there. On the one hand we have the Government willing to trade away Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in order to appease and bring about a peaceful solution to the Northern Ireland problem. On the other hand, we have in the proposed wording to the amendment to our Constitution yet another slap in the face to the religious minorities, such as the Methodists. On 28 May 1992 I read into the Official Report a quotation from The Irish Times in which the Methodist viewpoint on abortion was outlined. Needless to say the Protestant community have already outlined their extremely strong objections to our using the Constitution as a means of addressing this delicate issue. I should like to take this opportunity to read into the record again the stated viewpoint of the Methodist Church. An article in The Irish Times of 18 March 1992 in the Methodist notes entitled 'Church supports limited abortion' states that termination of pregnancy is permissible: 1. When the mother's life is at risk. Our first concern will be for the mother and her first concern may be one of commitment through her own continuing life to her family responsibilities... 2. Where there is risk of grave injury to the physical and mental health of the mother, especially if she has family responsibilities.... 3. In cases of rape or incest.... 4. In cases of gross abnormality of the foetus e. g. where reliable investigation [by amnios synthesis testing] indicates that the foetus would be born without a brain or would not long survive birth. In cases of lesser abnormality each decision should be made with extreme caution. Whatever about European Union, how can we address the problem and explain ourselves to one million Protestants living on the other side of the Border in view of the manner in which the Government have abused the Constitution [349] in this House? How can we assure them that the ethos would be protected if there was a unitary State? I ask the Minister directly to rise to the challenge and show them and the rest of us that he does not believe in the extension of the confessional state into Northern Ireland. Deputies from all sides have privately congratulated Members of Democratic Left for their 'sincerity' and 'political bravery'. Some of the compliments may well be genuine, or some may be quite cynical. However, we should now have addressed the issue and, depending on what answers were arrived at, should have decided our position on the termination of pregnancies. The acid test is how would we as parents respond if our daughter of 14 years of age had been raped, was clearly distraught because of a resulting pregnancy and had threatened suicide — and this has been proven by psychologists to be potentially possible. Women who have been victims of rape or incest and pregnant women whose health is endangered cannot become the innocent victims of a cowardly Government and be sacrificed for political expediency. Comparisons have been drawn between Great Britain and Ireland by various Ministers. There is the argument that if we were to protect the lives of those who were about to commit suicide and allow them to terminate a pregnancy, we would open the floodgates, as has happened in Great Britain. Since we are all members of the European Community, I would ask the Minister whether the Government see the English formula for termination of pregnancy as the only formula that exists in the world. There are others in Spain and Italy — two Catholic countries — as well as in Portugal, France and Germany which are not equated with the practice that exist in Great Britain. How is it that Catholics, Protestants and Bishops of both persuasions in Northern Ireland do not seem to have any difficulty with the fact that 800 abortions were carried out there last year under Northern Ireland law? [350] I wish to say in the very limited time at my disposal——;2626800

Two basic and central themes have run through the whole debate — concern to protect the lives and health of pregnant women and concern to protect the right to life of the unborn child. Widely divergent views have been expressed on the issues raised by the Bills, ranging from those who regard the Government's proposals on the substantive issue as not being restrictive enough and who oppose information being made available on abortion services abroad, to those who would in effect like to see abortion on [351] demand available in the State and directive as well as non-directive counselling.;2626805

994;Private Members' Business. - An Bille um an D&oacute &uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I will now deal with the more important points that have been raised in relation to each of the Bills individually, beginning with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which deals with the substantive right to life issue. Three proposed amendments to the motion for a second reading of this Bill have been put down. Two of them, one in the name of Deputy Brendan Howlin and the other in the names of the Deputies of the Democratic Left, propose that the House should decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill. The third proposed amendment, in the name of Deputy John Bruton, proposes that the Bill should be given a Second Reading only after the Dáil has first discussed, up to and including Committee State, legislation designed to elaborate on the practical implementation of the provision of this Bill. Deputy Bruton's proposal that a Second Reading of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill should follow the publication and debate of legislation to supplement the amendment is not acceptable to the Government. [352] Since the amendment would, in effect, negative the suicide aspect of the Supreme Court's test for a termination of pregnancy, any legislation to supplement the amendment would have to take that chance in the law into account. It would be objectionable, from a legal and more general point of view, to put legislation through the House, albeit short of completion of Final Stage, which sought to anticipate the outcome of a decision by the people in a referendum on the subject matter of that legislation. In my opening contribution on this debate I made clear the Government's position on legislation to supplement the amendment. If the Government are persuaded of the need for that legislation they will consider the matter further. We are not, however, at the present time convinced about the need for such legislation. Two reasons are given for Deputy Howlin's proposed amendment. The first is that the Bill poses dangers to the life and other fundamental rights of Irish women. In my speech opening this debate I went to considerable lengths to refute this suggestion and to spell out why the proposed amendment to the Constitution in fact affords full protection to the life and health of a pregnant woman. A number of other speakers on this side of the House, including the Minister for Health, have also pointed out the way in which the proposed amendment affords such protection. Spokespersons for the Labour Party in this debate have tried to pick holes in the wording used in the amendment. They have objected to the word 'necessary' on the basis that it implies that terminations would take place only where they are absolutely unavoidable and that in practice this could lead to situations where necessary terminations are delayed until a medical emergency has occurred. This objection has been raised despite the fact that the Supreme Court judgment itself uses the expression 'which can only be avoided by such termination.' They have referred to the 'innate offensiveness' of the phrase 'as distinct from the health' and have claimed the use of that term could also [353] rule out operations that would be perfectly legal now if they were necessary to save the health as distinct from the life of a woman. While I can well appreciate the strength of feeling on this matter, many of the comments made suggesting that the inclusion of the phrase could have adverse and unintended effects are without foundation. It has been suggested that a line cannot be unambiguously drawn between life and health and that this will give rise to difficulties. But the Supreme Court has already drawn that line and had no difficulty in doing so. The essence of the Supreme Court judgment is that such a line must be drawn on the proper interpretation of Article 40. 3.3º because that Article on its true interpretation will allow the right to life of the unborn to be superseded only where that is necessary to save the life of the mother in the sense that otherwise she will die. The Twelfth Amendment would not make any change in the Supreme Court's test on this point except to establish that test as something which could not be changed at any time in the future without the consent of the Irish people. Deputy Shatter is of the view apparently that the test laid down by the Supreme Court cannot be read as including the words 'as distinct from the health.' The fact is that all five of the members of the Supreme Court spoke specifically in terms of the life of the mother and in no instance was health unrelated to a risk to life contemplated as a ground. The distinction between life and health was included in the general test laid down by the Chief Justice and it is clear that that distinction was accepted by the other judges and was inherent in what they had to say. The quotations from the judgments referred to by Deputy Shatter in fact support what I am saying. It seems to me that a test of whether action is necessary to save the life of the mother is straightforward and should not give rise to difficulty in practice. This test has existed explicitly since the decision was given in the X case and, prior to publication of the Twelfth Amendment [354] of the Constitution Bill, I heard no suggestions about any possible difficulties in the operation of that test. I have dealt in my opening remarks with suggestions that doctors may feel that in some way the inclusion of the phrase in the amendment will inhibit them from acting until there is a degree of certainty in relation to the existence of a risk to life which would be wholly impracticable in medical practice which can only proceed on the basis of probability. I have explained that the Supreme Court decision requires only that the existence of a real and substantial risk to life be established on the balance of probabilities and that there is nothing in the amendment which would change that. There have been suggestions that the amendment will render unlawful medical treatment for mothers where that treatment is for the benefit of their health as opposed to saving their lives. I wish again to make the point that the amendment is not changing the law in this respect — it adopts the existing law as set out by the Supreme Court. So far as I know, nobody has ever suggested that the Supreme Court decision has given rise to the consequences that it is now claimed would flow from the amendment. My understanding of current medical practice is that medical treatment for a health condition which is not life-threatening is not permitted if the foreseen result of that treatment is the death of the foetus but that medical treatment is permitted where the life of the mother is at risk and the loss of the life of the foetus from such treatment is foreseen. It may, of course, also occasionally happen that a drug or other therapy given for some condition causes an entirely unforeseen adverse response and leads to the loss of life of the foetus. I am advised that the wording proposed could not be held to imply a breach of the law in circumstances where the life of the foetus is lost as an unforeseen and unintended consequence of treatment carried out in good faith. Deputy Spring made the point that the phrase 'necessary to save the life' means [355] that the risk to life must be imminent, before action to terminate the pregnancy would be permitted. He mentioned cases of cardiac conditions or treatment involving chemotherapy in the early stages of pregnancy.;2626811

There have also been complaints that the amendment does not deal with such matters as the morning after pill, IUDs and so on. Can I emphasise again the extremely specific nature of the amendment being proposed? What we are doing is adopting the test for termination of pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, as set out by the Supreme Court with the difference only that we are not providing that a risk of self destruction should be a ground for termination of pregnancy.;2626833

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Far from providing more [358] grounds on which a pregnancy can be terminated we are, in fact, restricting the grounds that have existed in our law since the Supreme Court gave its decision in the X case. While I fully appreciate the depth and genuineness of feelings aroused by the matters I have mentioned — particularly rape and incest — I also appreciate and must take account of the deep feeling against abortion that exists throughout this country and which was given explicit expression some years ago when a majority of the people voted to include Article 40. 3.3º in our Constitution. All of these matters which I have just mentioned are outside the scope of the very specific measure we are proposing. However strongly some people may feel about these matters, I doubt very much that there would be widespread support for the changes suggested which would be seen, I have no doubt, as paving the way for widescale abortions. The amendment proposed does not deal with these issues. The position under law in relation to them will be the same after the amendment is passed as it is today. The suggestion has been made that the proper way to approach the problems we are dealing with is simply to repeal Article 40. 3.3º. Some people who advocate that course see Article 40. 3.3º as the factor that has given rise to the controversial and troubling questions that now concern us. I do not think we need spend much time on this suggestion. Is it being seriously suggested by any Deputy that the people of this country who voted by a large majority to include Article 40. 3.3º in the Constitution would be likely now, nine years later, to reverse their view and vote to remove Article 40. 3.3º from the Constitution? I do not believe such a prospect is likely and because of that I regard this suggestion as academic. The substance of Deputy Shatter's contribution seemed to amount to little more than a plea for more time to consider the issues involved. His case would have been better made had he not decided to use a substantial amount of the time available to him to make a series of baseless [359] allegations about the Government's approach to these complex matters. In my opening contribution to the debate I stated that the Government recognise the genuineness and the depth of people's feelings and concerns about this whole subject — whether from a pro-life, a pro-choice or other point of view. I also placed on the record of the House the Government's appreciation of the willingness of the other parties to endeavour to achieve a consensus on how best to approach this matter. Given these remarks and the nature of the difficult issues we are all here trying to deal with, it is a pity that Deputy Shatter, having given a highly selective account of the debate on the 1983 amendment——;2626837

I am afraid it is difficult to avoid concluding that remarks of this kind by the Deputy, combined with a call which amounts to saying that the best approach to take for the present is to procrastinate in relation to the issues dealt with in the Bills before the House, reveal a reluctance to actually deal with — and take a position on — the real issues involved.

In particular, I have heard no proposal put forward as an alternative to the Government's which would, in reality, achieve [361] the objective which I believe many Members share.;2626845

The effect of the amendment is to afford full protection to the lives of pregnant women and it negatives the Supreme Court's test in respect of suicide but in no other respect.;2626847

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;The mental health ground must in the Government's view be removed because it would result in more, not fewer, lives being lost and this has been the experience in other countries. In effect the changes in the law proposed by the Democratic Left Part would introduce legislation here not dissimilar to that in our neighbouring jurisdiction where there is widescale abortion on demand. Many Deputies have complained about the time-table which the Government have set in this matter. I would remind the House, however, that the Party Leader's statement last June indicated that legislative and/or constitutional changes arising from the Supreme Court decision would be placed before the Dáil by the Government as soon as is practicable and, in any case, by the autumn. The Government have delivered on that. We have honoured the commitment which was made to the people. The Leaders' statement also referred to a referendum on the issues of travel and information being held in the autumn. I think most people would have concluded from that statement that if the Government decided that the substantive issue should be dealt with by way of an amendment to the Constitution that this referendum would be held at the same time as the other referenda. The people [362] in accepting the Maastricht Treaty no doubt were influenced by the commitment given to deal with the issues arising from the decision in the X case. I think that it would be utterly unreasonable now to expect them to deal with the issues on travel and information not knowing what is going to be done on the substantive issue. Indeed I believe that such an approach could have implications for the likelihood of the amendment on travel and information succeeding. In response to the point made by a number of Deputies opposed to excluding suicide as a ground for termination of pregnancy, I refer the House to the contribution which the Minister for Health made to the debate last evening when he dealt with that matter thoroughly. I would just like to reiterate one point he made: if it is very difficult to predict accurately in an individual case, accepting suicidal tendencies as a ground for termination would be likely to lead to the certain loss of many unborn children, without any certainty that even one suicide had been averted.;2626849

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I turn now to the Thirteenth Amendment Bill on freedom to travel between the State and other states. There has been general support in the debate for the aim and general effect of this proposed amendment to the Constitution. Some reservations have been expressed, however, about the form of the amendment and about whether it achieves the effect it is desired to achieve. I am satisfied that the reservations are not well founded. Deputy Spring suggested that the wording provided for in the amendment on travel seemed to assume that there is a general right to travel under the Constitution even though, he says, such a general right is not referred to in the Constitution. I am unable to agree with the Deputy that there is no such existing constitutional right to travel. On the reading of the judgments of each of the five [363] judges of the Supreme Court in the X case it is clear that such a right exists. For example, the Chief Justice spoke of 'the very fundamental nature of the right to travel and its particular importance in relation to the characteristics of a free society' and he did so in a context in which he made it clear he was talking about a constitutional right. Judge Hederman referred to the 'exercise of the Constitutional right to travel.' Judge McCarthy referred to the right to travel having been identified as one of the unenumerated rights guaranteed under Article 40 of the Constitution. Deputy Spring seems to suggest that the proposed Thirteenth Amendment as it stands means that the Oireachtas could at some future time prohibit a pregnant woman from travelling abroad for an abortion because the amendment simply says that Article 40. 3.3º shall not limit freedom to travel. It seems to me to be straining things a bit to suggest that an explicit provision of the Constitution to the effect that considerations arising by virtue of Article 40. 3.3º shall not limit freedom of travel could be circumvented by ordinary legislation saying that considerations of a similar kind could be invoked to restrict that freedom. That is apart altogether from the inherent improbability of the Oireachtas ever attempting to enact such a law, given the unqualified support there is from all parties and the virtually universal support there is from the general public for freedom to travel. Deputy Spring has referred also to the fact that, before the enactment of Article 40. 3.3º, the courts indicated that the unborn is implicitly protected by other provisions of the Constitution apart from Article 40. 3.3º, so that those other provisions could be relied on in a travel injunction case, since the proposed amendment relates only to limiting the scope of Article 40. 3.3º. The right to life of the unborn is now explicitly recognised and guaranteed by Article 40. 3.3º. That explicit guarantee has been held to take precedence over the right of the mother to travel where she [364] intends to leave the State to have an abortion and there is not a real or substantial risk to her life. If the people by referendum now decides that that express guarantee is not to limit freedom to travel out of the State, surely it is fanciful to suggest that the courts would circumvent that expression of the will of the people by reverting to a possible implicit guarantee of the right to life of the unborn that had been referred to in a case prior to the creation of the express guarantee in Article 40. 3.3º? I am advised that a reference to Article 40. 3.3º in the proposed Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is sufficient to achieve the aims of that Bill. Deputy Spring also stated that the amendment should seek to protect the right to receive a service lawfully available elsewhere in addition, as he says, to simply establishing the right to travel to receive such a service. I am satisfied that the amendment as it stands will ensure that a woman who wishes to travel abroad to avail of a service in another jurisdiction that is unlawful here but lawful in the other jurisdiction will have the right to do so in the knowledge that an injunction may not be taken against her to stop her travelling. There is no good basis for any suggestion that, even though a woman is by virtue of an express provision of the Constitution not to be injuncted from travelling abroad, she could still be injuncted from having an abortion after she travels abroad. Of the three Supreme Court judges who in the X case found that a general injunction against travel abroad could lie where there was no real and substantial risk to the mother's life, two explicitly rejected the idea of an injunction confined to restricting a woman from leaving the jurisdiction for the purpose of having an abortion outside the State — on the basis that such an injunction would not be effective to protect the right of the unborn to life. While I do not accept the need for Deputy Spring's amendments to the Bill on freedom to travel, they are all at least well and truly constructively motivated. I cannot say the same for Deputy Shatter's [365] contribution on this issue which amounted to no more than some cheap shots at the bona fides of having the constitutional amendment proposed in the Thirteenth Amendment Bill side by side with that proposed in the Twelfth Amendment Bill.;2626851

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;The fact that something is prohibited in the State is no reason to prevent a person travelling out of the State to avail of it in another state where it is lawful. This is not a phenomenon peculiar to this country. Nor should the fact that something is lawful in another state and some Irish people travel there to avail of it mean that it should be made legal here. We have our own value system about how the public interest and the private interest should be balanced with regard to what should or should not be lawful in the State. The substance of the Fourteenth Amendment Bill, on freedom to obtain or make available information, has also received general support in the course of this debate, though again there have been some reservations expressed about its form and about the fact that the legislation on this matter had not been published. To take the latter point first, my colleague the Minister for Health has, of course, now indicated to the House what the contents of the Government's legislative proposals on the information issue will be. The draft legislative proposals on the information issue will be. The draft legislative proposals themselves will be published shortly so that when the people vote on the proposed amendments to the Constitution they will have a clear picture of what the conditions that are to be laid down by law will be. In outlining the proposed legislation, the Minister for Health explained that the information of a general nature will be permitted to be made available through certain media, provided that it is factual and does not seek to promote abortion in preference to alternative courses of action. However, where a [366] pregnant woman seeks advice concerning her own specific circumstances from, for example, a doctor or an advice agency, it will only be permissible to supply information concerning abortion services in the context of full non-directive counselling on all of the options open to the person concerned.;2626853

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;If, having considered all of these options, the woman decides that she wishes to seek an abortion outside the country, the doctor or advice agency will be free to provide whatever further information she may need. However, abortion referral will not be permitted, since this goes beyond the provision of information. My brief reference to this matter in the course of my earlier speech was, of course, entirely consistent with this, but I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify it further for Deputy Owen. Deputy Spring has objected that the wording of the proposed amendment is negative rather than affirmative, that it does not create a right to give or receive information and that it does not prohibit the Oireachtas from banning information. The purpose of the proposed amendment is quite specific. It is to address the fact that the dissemination in the State of information on abortion which is unlawful in the State but lawful elsewhere is prohibited by virtue of Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. The intent of the amendment is to remove that restriction on the freedom there would otherwise be to provide and receive such information and to make that freedom subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law. I want to conclude by shifting the focus from the individual Bills for a moment and looking at the overall thrust and balance of what the Government are proposing. I would ask that I might be given time. [367]An Leas Cheann Comhairle: Does the House agree? Agreed.;2626855

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resum;21.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I thank the Leader of the main Opposition party. The positive affirmation of the right to life of the unborn, with due regard to the right to life of the mother, which was adopted by the people in 1983 and is contained in Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution, is being retained. The essence of the test laid down by the Supreme Court in interpreting that provision is also being retained, except that a risk of self-destruction will not be a ground for termination of pregnancy. The proposed amendment on the substantive issue will protect the right to life of the unborn child whole at the same time ensuring that the mother will receive all treatment that is necessary to resolve any life-threatening medical condition she suffers from, even if that treatment results in the loss of the unborn child's life. The amendment is pro-life, affording as it does the maximum practicable protection to he life of both the mother and the unborn child. It is also designed to avoid the possibility that abortion as that term is understood in everyday usage — in other words termination of pregnancy which is not for the sole purpose of saving the life of the mother — might become available in this country. That is why it excludes health unrelated to a risk to the mother's life as a ground for termination of pregnancy. The right of pregnant women to travel between this country and other countries, whatever the purpose of their journey, which was freely exercised before the X case, is being restored. The one point on which there was a virtually unanimous groundswell of public opinion after that case was that there should be no restriction on freedom to travel by reason of Article 40. 3.3º. Important new rights to receive information, including non-directive conselling, about abortion services available [368] in other countries are being conferred on women. Again, there was a widespread feeling among the general public after the X case that information of this kind should be accessible to pregnant women, especially those in crisis pregnancies, who should be free to make an informed decision in awareness of the full range of alternative options available. As my colleague, the Minister for Health, has made clear, directive counselling, or the actual advocacy of abortion, will not be permitted in the proposed legislation on this subject. The whole question of the right to life raises the most profound and delicate issues, moral, medical and legal. Harmonising competing or conflicting rights to life, in particular, creates problems of a most difficult, not to say intractable, kind. The X case and the public debate in its aftermath gave rise to a series of complex and difficult issues. I think that any fair-minded and impartial observer would be prepared to acknowledge that the proposals in the three Bills to amend the Constitution that are now before the House represent a conscientious, reasonable and balanced response to those issues and one that is in the public interest. The Government are satisfied that these proposals are the correct response to the problems arising and are happy to commend these amendments of the Constitution to the people in the forthcoming referenda on 3 December. I propose to the House that the motion to give the three Bills in question a Second Reading should now be adopted.;2626857

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Brendan Howlin;The Labour Party;The import of the amendment which we had tabled was to establish in the Constitution an unambiguous and clearly stated right to travel. Clearly what is required is not the implicit right which the Minister says exists, but an explicit right. We agree that there is an implicit right to travel. Many of the Supreme Court justices said that existed, but there is not a clear explicit right to travel from this state to other states. Although the Minister laid great store on quoting the views of members of the Supreme Court, stating that such an implicit right existed, clearly the Supreme Court is not a fixed entity and the views of the five individuals or a majority of the five individuals could change at some future stage. We would be on much firmer ground if we stated not that nothing shall diminish the right, but established it clearly and explicitly in our Constitution. It is regrettable that the attitude of the Government to the amendment is simply not to prohibit or deny that right which does not exist explicitly. I would have preferred to have inserted our amendment.;2627150
1050;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pat McCartan;The Workers' Party;On the question of the right to travel, on Second Stage I raised an issue which the Minister did not have time to deal with except in a general way. I would like to know if it is the Minister's intention in the wording he proposes to insert to provide for an absolute and unfettered right to travel free from any interference under any of the other subsections in Article 40 or by any interpretation that might be provided by the [404] Supreme Court in attempting to give effect not only to this subsection with regard to travel but to the general propositons contained in Article 40. 3.3º. On Second Stage I instanced a hypothetical case which I will again put to the Minister in the hope that he can throw some light on the extent to which the Government or indeed any Government can provide for the right of a pregnant women to travel from Ireland. Supposing we have a healthy pregnant single or married woman who is pregnant against her will and she confides in her husband or boyfriend that she intends to leave Ireland to go to another country for an abortion, either because the pregnancy is unwanted or because she has been advised, for example, that the child were irreparably damaged in some way. If the husband or boyfriend is aggrieved and wishes the event not to occur, he can go to the court. The scenario I am suggesting is not such an unlikely one, because in the wake of the X case wider newspaper coverage was given to an incident involving a man from Derry city who presented himself at a city centre police station attempting to make a similar case. In any event the aggrieved man proceeds to court to try to stop the woman leaving. On the one hand he is seeking to prevent the termination of life in another State by preventing the women from leaving. On the other hand he is seeking an affirmation of his parental rights as provided for under the Constitution. Will that person be granted an injunction or not? I worry that the courts would have to deal with confliciting rights — the right to life of the foetus, the father's parental rights to the extent that these are provided for under Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution and the proposed Twelfth Amendment, and the right of the women to travel. In the X case and in a number of other cases that have been quoted here, the Supreme Court indicated that the Constitution must be taken as a whole, that there is a hierarchy of rights with that Constitution and that the courts, in trying to balance one conflicting right against another, will simply weigh one against [405] the other. It is clear that the courts would give priority to the right to life of the foetus and the parental right of a father as opposed to the mere right of the woman to travel. I believe that irrespective of the wording proposed by the Government there will not be an absolute gurantee of women's right to travel in all circumstances after the passing of this referendum. I would like to hear the Minister's view of this. It is also important to put on record the position of the Attorney General as the custodian of the Constitution in discharging his functions in this regard. I would like the Minister to clarify whether or not the Attorney General would or would not take an active role, as he did in the X case, by going unilaterally of his own motion to court to seek an injunction. The Minister will recall that in the wake of the X case and in the context of the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty the Attorney General seemed to give certain public assurances that his office would not again act in the way it did in the X case. If there is substance in my concerns about this legislative proposal in the context of the Constitution, then the Attorney General will have a very real role to play. I wonder if the Minister in any way shares my concerns about the non-absoluteness of this provision and whether he intends to secure any further public commitments from the Attorney General with regard to his role in interpreting and implementing this provision.;2627151

However it might be useful if I were to make a few comments on the substance of that amendment.

On a reading of the judgments of each of the five [406] judges of the Supreme Court in the X case it is clear that such a right does exist.;2627152

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Yes, and I would refer the Deputies to some of the following statements of the judges which might be useful. The Chief Justice, for instance, spoke of 'the very fundamental nature of the right to travel and its particular importance in relation to the characteristics of a free society'. That particular reference is important. He did so in the context of harmonising interacting constitutional rights. Judge Hederman referred to 'the exercise of the Constitutional right to travel'. That is pretty explicit too. Judge McCarthy referred to the right to travel having been identified as one of the unenumerated rights guaranteed under Article 40 of the Constitution and that would seem to be quite indicative in what it is attempting to convey. Judges Egan and O'Flaherty also referred to the right to travel. In the face of those statements it seems unarguable that there is a right to travel under the Constitution. Moreover, the judge made those statements without reference to EC law. In fact it was made clear that no decision on any question of European law was necessary for the court to give its judgment. If EC law is taken into account in considering the travel issue, since travel is of fundamental importance under the EC Treaties and since those Treaties are part of our constitutional law, it is inconceivable that travel could be regarded as other than a fundamental right of persons in this country. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the wording of the Bill is correct. It is correct in assuming that there is an existing constitutional right to travel, and the Bill removes the restriction imposed in the X case by reference to Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. The amendment proposed by the Deputies has not been allowed but, at the same time, let me give an idea of what my thinking would be if it had been allowed. The exercise of the right to travel is, of necessity, subject to restrictions [407] in certain circumstances, for example, if the law imposes conditions to be imposed by the court when granting bail, including a requirement that the person concerned would have to surrender his or her passport and report at frequent intervals to a Garda station. Persons who are wards of court as well cannot be taken out of the jurisdiction without the express permission of the court. If a positive affirmation of the right to travel were to be written into the Constitution as is suggested, that affirmation would have to be couched in such a way as to allow for the exceptions represented by the types of cases that I have just referred to, and the Deputy will appreciate that. That would take us into the area of addressing issues which there is no need for us to address under this Bill. All it is necessary for us to do is to remove the restriction on freedom to travel which was imposed by the decision in the X case by reason of Article 40. 3.3º. That is what the proposed amendment to the Constitution does. It would be unnecessary and it would not be sensible to try to do any more. Deputy McCartan spoke about a hypothetical case. I know that can be useful to try to establish a principle. At the same time the Deputy would not do well to pursue the Belfast case too far, not knowing the full details. Obviously we cannot talk about that case here but I can tell the Deputy that I have some extra information on that it is not exactly as it was portrayed elsewhere. Perhaps we could leave it at that except to say that the amendment makes no exception and I cannot see how someone could be adjudged other than under the terms of the amendment we are discussing. As I have stated on previous occasions any pregnant woman, indeed anybody, has the fundamental right to go to any other country and it has been established and understood like that, not just by the Supreme Court judges but also under EC law. Obviously anybody can take a court action people can go into court to seek a decision on any particular aspect of any [408] law, be it constitutional or general law, but it is my understanding that the amendment makes no exceptions and this amendment could not and would not be used to stop someone leaving the country for whatever purpose they wish. It is only right to say, as Deputies will remember, that the Attorney General made remarks about the question of injunctions following the Maastricht Treaty referendum result. That position still stands. I do not foresee any situation arising where the Attorney General, in the circumstances set out by the Deputy, will seek an injunction to stop anyone travelling for any particular purpose as contemplated by Article 40. 3.3º, as it will be amended.;2627154
1054;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;The Fine Gael Party are anxious to ensure that on this issue the imposition as regards the right of women to travel which was impeded by the judgment in the 'X' case is removed. We are also anxious to ensure that when the referenda are held there will be minimal confusion. We have taken the view that the amendments relating to both travel and information are largely in order although we could engage in a degree of nit-picking in trying to take out one word and replacing it with another. However, we are of the view that it is of essential importance that the referenda on these two issues succeed. I am therefore anxious to ensure that I say nothing in this House which would give rise to confusion to raise doubts as to the desirability of these two referenda succeeding. During this discussion I will raise certain questions in the context of the substance and it is important that the Minister's replies to those questions are put on the record of the House. In relation to the right to travel, I broadly agree with the Minister. We find ourselves in a rather unusual situation, Sir, because I recall that when I normally table an amendment to a Bill that is out of order I am shot down within ten seconds. I therefore appreciate the fact that you are allowing us some latitude because effectively we are discussing the [409] broad sweep of the issue under the guise of this amendment. I have no doubt that there is a constitutional right to travel. I suppose I should make a declaration of interest because I was one of the lawyers involved in the first case in which it was decided that such a right existed in a substantive way. That case was determined by the then President of the High Court, the present Chief Justice, in 1978, and it was related to the right of a child to get a passport. It is important to say that this right was given an implicit recognition by Mr. Justice Kenny as long ago as 1963 in the case of Ryan v. the Attorney General. There is one quotation which is particularly apposite because it emphasises the need to ensure that the referendum on the right to travel is successful. I think there is a general consensus on all sides of the House that this issue must be addressed. Indeed, I raised a query about this issue in the 1983 debate whether a woman's right to travel would be impeded. To some extent the events of the X case could be described by me as fact following fiction, because in a novel I wrote which had some success in this country some years ago there was a TD, who happily never occupied the benches of this House, by the name of Brannigan—;2627155

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Is the Deputy reissuing it for the Christmas trade because if he is I want a signed copy?;2627156
1056;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;No, this is not a commercial. In the story that character pronounced himself, like so many people in this House, as pro-life. Of course we are all pro-life I have yet to see anyone put their hand up in the air to say they are pro-death. This particular TD, the fictional Deputy Brannigan, was giving out about Irish women having abortions in England and rather than deciding that we should have proper counselling, family support and family planning services and all the other things that we need in the area of education so that people could come to terms with their own sexuality [410] his proposal was that we should enact laws which would allow the Garda to stop pregnant women at exit points from the State and prevent them leaving the country. He argued that they should be restrained and prevented from leaving during the course of the pregnancy. When I wrote that novel in 1988 some people might have thought that this was extreme until of course we saw what happened in the X case after proceedings had been initiated by the Attorney General. I do not want to see any more X cases nor I am sure does any other Member of this House. It is important therefore that I make the point that the right to travel in the X case was impeded by the Supreme Court on the idea that there is a hierarchy of rights and, in the context of protecting the life of the unborn where a mother's life was not at risk, that a pregnant woman could be injuncted and prevented from leaving the State. This decision gave rise to a widespread outcry. Indeed, it is interesting to quote the words of Mr. Justice Finlay in the case of M v. the Attorney General, in which I was involved, as reported at page 81 of the 1979 Irish Reports: One of the hallmarks which is commonly accepted as dividing states which are categorised as authoritarian from those which are categorised as free and democratic is the inability of the citizens of or residents in the former to travel outside their country except at what is usually considered to be the whim of the Executive Power. Therefore I have no doubt that a right to travel outside the State exists. He said that it existed in a limited form in the context of the State being entitled to restrain people who are awaiting trial on criminal charges from leaving the State and the right of the State in certain circumstances to withhold passports. In general, the right to travel was referred to as the right to freedom of movement by Mr. Justice Kenny in 1963, and in the case which came before the then President of the High Court in 1978, and to which I have referred, it was pronounced upon again. Passing references [411] have been made to it in other cases. Indeed, the Supreme Court confirmed that the right exists, so the only difficulty that we have as a result of the X case arises from the Supreme Court judgment. The only way to deal with this issue is to make a specific amendment to Article 40. 3.3º as suggested. To be fair to Deputy Howlin, the purpose of his proposal in the House is to tease out a position where there would be a general explicit right to travel. He meant well by it but of course at this stage the courts have declared that more implicit rights than explicit rights exist in the Constitution and they are said to be based largely on Articles 40 and 41 and on the Christian and democratic nature of this State. While I do not want to misrepresent what Deputy Howlin is proposing — he is not suggesting this — if we simply took on board a general right to travel as proposed in the amendment which has been ruled out of order and did not amend Article 40. 3.3º, we would be back to the possibility of a hierarchy of rights and a differentiation between rights and a problem whereby pregnant women could be injuncted and prevented from leaving the country which is something I believe no one wants to see. If we want to reduce the number of Irish women going to England for abortions, which should be one of the aims of our social policy it is frequently genuflected to in rhetoric while absolutely nothing is done about it by way of social action or practice on the part of the Government — we should do so by way of social action and not by way of injuncting women at our borders, ports and airports and preventing them from leaving the country. It is important that the equal right of men and women to travel should not be impeded. It was probably worth while for Deputy Howlin to raise this issue but in the jurisprudence of our courts there can be no doubt that a right to travel exists and the problem we have to resolve arises directly from the decision in the X case. It has to be resolved in the context of the specific sub-Article [412] of Article 40 which was inserted in the Constitution in 1983.;2627157
1057;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Brendan Howlin;The Labour Party;I will endeavour to stick to fact and not fiction and to refrain from nit-picking. The Labour Party's aim is to tease out the meaning of words and have clarity. That is why, unlike other parties, we did not seek to amend the Bill on Second Stage. We agreed with the principle discussed on Second Stage. However, we would like to tease out the implications of the enactment of this proposed legislation. I am still not convinced by the Minister's case — although I accept his sincerity — in regard to the two points he put to me, that such a provision would not be explicitly stated. In relation to the declaration that such a right exists in EC law, I do not believe that case has yet been proven. What appears to exist in EC law is the right to travel for economic purposes, but the general right to travel will not be explicitly stated until such time as the Maastricht Treaty becomes operable and I assume that will be when all 12 EC states enact that Treaty which, at the earliest, will be next year. As of now, we have no guarantee that such a general EC right exists. In regard to exceptions, to which the Minister referred, there are a number of rights specifically spelled out in Article 40. 3.2º of the Constitution which do not spell out the exceptions to those fundamental principles of right. Those exceptions are inherent and I do not believe one needs at this stage to insert what would obviously be exceptions to the general principle of rights. The Constitution spells out fundamental rights and that is what is required in relation to this specific right, the right of citizens to travel from this State to others. I was minded to raise this matter by the attitude of the Progressive Democrats, the Minister's partners in Government. They stated in their policy document that they sought to have these words included as a new Article 40. 3.2º. They stated: 'The State shall, in particular by its laws, protect as best it may from unjust attack and in the case of [413] injustice done vindicate the life, good name and property rights and the right to travel both within and outside the State of every citizen'. The form of words tabled in my name and that of Deputy Spring was sought to be inserted by the Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in Government. In their commentary which they attached to their policy statement requiring those words to be inserted in the Constitution they stated: At present, the right to travel is not expressly protected by the Constitution. The right is, of course, implicitly protected by Article 40. 3.1º (see The State (M) v. Minister for Foreign Affairs [1979]), but we thought it desirable to take this opportunity to insert a general and express right to travel in Article 40. 3.2º, along with the right to life, person, good name and property. Such a right is already recognised in the 4th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights which Ireland has ratified. It was also included in the Progressive Democrats' Draft Constitution for a New Republic in 1988. Therefore, there is considerable support for the notion that an explicit right to travel should be numbered among those already specifically stated in the Constitution. It is spurious to suggest that once those explicit rights are inserted in the Constitution there would be a requirement to table exceptions and write those into the Constitution as well. It is equally spurious to suggest that EC law, as of now, absolutely and clearly vindicates the right of citizens to move between states. Of course, the other issue will be the right of citizens to move from this State to jurisdictions outside the European Community. For all those reasons I am not convinced by the Minister's assertion that there is no need for an explicit statement of the kind I seek. I agree with other speakers that there is a fairly unanimous view on all sides in this House that the right to travel is most desirable. We want to put a form of words before the people that we can all wholeheartedly [414] endorse and support. For that reason there is a Committee Stage of this Bill. As a legislator, I am required to enact to the best of my ability the best form of words to be put before the people, but I am still not convinced by the Minister's assertion that there is no need to expressly state this fundamental right.;2627158

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Seán Treacy;The Labour Party;I would like to elaborate on the communication which I conveyed to Deputies Spring and Howlin in regard to ruling their amendment out of order. Amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Spring and Howlin, was ruled out of order by the Chair as it contains a proposal which is outside the scope of the Bill. The Bill, as read a Second Time, addresses the issue of the right to travel in the context of the right to life as provided for in Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. The amendment, however, seeks to include in Article 40. 3.2º the issue of the right to travel in the more general sense. Accordingly, since it addresses the broader issue of the general right to travel the amendment is deemed outside the scope of the Bill and I had no option, therefore, but to rule it out of order.;2627159

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;Perhaps the Deputy is correct. Although it is not specified in clear language in this amendment, [415] what is being aimed at is to guarantee the right of women in Ireland to travel to Britain primarily for abortions. That is what the amendment seek to do, but it does not say that. The amendment states that this subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and other State. It appears, therefore, that the amendment is deficient. My understanding — again in a lay person's terms — is that the Supreme Court decision in the X case found, that it was unlawful to go to Britain for an abortion except in a case where the woman concerned was shown to be suicidal. The other amendment here seeks to rule out that provision. The Government's amendment in regard to abortion also seeks to provide for what is euphemistically described as direct abortion in circumstances where there is a real and substantive threat to the life of a woman. On the one hand, the amendment in regard to the substantive issue seeks to rule out suicide as a case for abortion, the grounds on which the Supreme Court found a young woman was entitled to an abortion and, on the other hand, it seeks to introduce new grounds for abortion in Irish law. This amendment seeks to guarantee women the right to travel to Britain for abortion, presumably in any other circumstances. The Supreme Court found that it is unlawful to travel to Britain for an abortion in any circumstances other than those which are lawful here. That is my understanding of the Supreme Court's findings in the X case, but if I am wrong I would like the Minister to clarify that. My understanding is that they found that it was unlawful to go to England for an abortion in circumstances which were unlawful here. The point Deputy McCartan seeks to clarify regarding the concrete or hypothetical cases is how a woman who wishes to travel to Britain for an abortion which would be unlawful here — almost 5,000 women travelled to Britain last year for this purpose — can be guaranteed this right under the amendment when the Supreme Court in the X case found that [416] it was unlawful, and that she could not travel to Britain for that purpose? Unless we explicitly write into this Article of the Constitution that women do have that right to travel for an abortion, I do not see how such a right can be established in the Supreme Court. The right of the foetus established in this Article will always be regarded as superior to that of the mother's right to travel. That is the situation as I understand it. The discussion here clearly indicates that regardless of what is agreed by the Oireachtas and what the people subsequently decide in a referendum, it is as inevitable as day follows night that there will be a challenge in the Supreme Court at some stage to establish the points I am making today. That indicates that the approach of trying to deal with these matters by way of referendum is totally wrong and should be abandoned.;2627164

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pat McCartan;The Workers' Party;I will be brief. It is significant to acknowledge, and repeat for the record, that the Minister has said that he does not envisage the Attorney General playing any role in any injunction-type cases in the future once this referendum is passed. That is a significant acknowledgement, if I understood the Minister correctly, in respect of his interpretation of the effect of this legislation. The points I have raised with him — hypothetically but, I believe very realistically in view of the strong views of the community on this matter — need to be further addressed. I acknowledge that there is a general right to liberty contained in Article 40. 4.1º. In that regard we can accommodate restrictions on persons charged with criminal offences or, indeed, persons of unsound mind or minors. A woman who is pregnant does not fit into any of those categories. It is regrettable that we would bring up issues relating to criminals or, indeed, lunatics in this context. I am concerned about the issue raised, by Mr. Hogan, a law lecturer in Trinity College, in his article in The Irish Times on 8 August 1992, and I would like to hear the Minister's response to it. Mr. Hogan's article stated: Even if the Attorney General still feels debarred by that undertaking from seeking a travel injunction, yesterday's events — this refers to the ruling of Mr. Justice Morris in the SPUC v. Grogan case — show that private citizens (such as, for example, a husband who sought to restrain his wife from having a 'convenience' abortion) can still enforce Article 40. 3.3º. When pressed on this very question at the launch of the Maastricht White Paper, the Taoiseach was quoted (The Irish Times April 24th 1992), as doubting whether any private injunction of this kind would succeed after June 18th adding that a 'yes' vote would have to be taken into account [418] by the courts. That assurance (such as it was) in relation to private enforcement actions has also been shown to have been based on fairly specious legal assumptions. The event on 18 June was the affirmation by the Irish people of the Maastricht Treaty. There is an acknowledgment that a private citizen can bring an injunction or seek legal redress under the Constitution and I want to know the view of the Government, and their advisers, in regard to their interpretation of the workability of the sections. Does the Minister anticipate that a court could grant an injunction against a woman who may wish to travel to England for an abortion, whatever her reasons may be?;2627170

I would also like the Minister to clarify whether there is any risk of an injunction being taken out against a person who stays in Ireland but assists a girl or a woman to travel abroad to have an abortion? That person would not have left the jurisdiction, but would they be in breach of our Constitution by assisting in an act that is unlawful here but lawful elsewhere? Could a person who may have provided an airline ticket, the financial resources required, or the actual information be subject to criminal prosecution. The Minister used the words 'referral information' as opposed to factual information, and there appears to be a distinction made in regard to these words by the Ministers for Justice and Health which we will try to tease out on the next Bill. I would like an assurance from the Minister that this amendment cannot be used as a backdoor method to prosecute a person who assists a woman to travel to England or elsewhere for an abortion.;2627171

That is what is being attempted here and we want the Irish people to support and endorse that on 3 December. I thought it was quite fair of Deputy Shatter to state that he did not wish to raise any doubts in regard to this issue, because we are all agreed on this and we all have the same objective. I do not believe that any doubts have been raised but some points may require further clarification and elaboration. It is important to remember that I answered some of the points made by Deputy Spring in this regard yesterday evening.;2627172

It was our wish that this decision would have been otherwise. This is a genuine attempt to put the matter right so that a further decision of that kind cannot be made by the Supreme Court. Deputy Howlin referred to the whole question of the fundamental right to travel. That is relevant, but it must be remembered that this right is already well established in a European context and was agreed in the original founding Treaties of the EC.

1079;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;The Maastricht Treaty reconfirms this matter as distinct from restating it, and it is important that that be made clear. What we are seeking to achieve here is to put beyond doubt the right to travel and to make it clear that it cannot be restricted by reason of Article 40. 3.3º. Deputy De Rossa made an interesting point, but maybe I mistook him, on the question of travel between Ireland and the UK. The amendment explicitly refers to travel to all states. We deliberately inserted this clause because we did no want a restriction applied in a subsequent Supreme Court case to travel to some other country that might not be incorported within the Community states — we are dealing with all states, not just member states of the EC. I agree with Deputy De Rossa that, unfortunately, a number of people choose to go to the United Kingdom and other places for the purpose of terminating pregnancies, and certainly that is a challenge to us all. It is everybody's wish that very few people, if anyone at all, would go abroad for this purpose. There is much to be done in this regard, but we are not talking about that matter this morning. We are talking about the right of individuals to seek whatever service [421] is lawfully available in any state to which they wish to travel. I take the Deputy's point that what we do here may be challenged at a future date. I do not foresee a challenge in the Supreme Court on what we are seeking to accomplish in this amendment, but it could happen. As the Deputy suggested, somebody may seek to have a matter clarified by way of an interpretative decision in the Supreme Court. Freedom of travel cannot be achieved beyond doubt without having a referendum. What we were concerned about was to find the right words to put everything beyond doubt. We considered many words suggested by people in the past, but nobody said this is not a good wording. They just want to be absolutely sure that it achieves what everybody wishes it to achieve. We believe that we have done that in finding the simplest words possible, stating that freedom would not be restricted between the State and any other state by Article 40. 3.3º. We must not forget that the Supreme Court decision and the interpretation given by the judges was based on Article 40. 3.3º. The amendment states quite explicitly that Article 40. 3.3º cannot be used to deny freedom to travel. That is the key point and it was on that ground that freedom was denied.;2627180

I do not have the details of the Hogan case referred to by Deputy McCartan, but the answer to his question is no. Deputy De Rossa also said that a matter can be referred for judicial consideration and I cannot deny that, but we do not foresee it happening. The wording is so tight that we feel that it could not be challenged again. If we had not felt strongly enough in that regard we would have had to consider an entirely different formula of words. Some time was spent considering that matter and our advice is that this wording will satisfy what we wish to achieve. I do not foresee any case going to the court on the basis of freedom to travel, and before the X case nobody contemplated that it was a possibility.;2627186

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Maybe it was. The whole question of the 1983 amendment was argued yesterday, but nobody suggested that the whole amendment should be repealed in its entirety. The Irish people decided on the matter and in good faith they voted on a certain understanding. They never contemplated that somebody would be denied the right to travel out of the country. Neither did we contemplate that this would happen, and we certainly do not contemplate it now. We believe that this wording makes it abundantly clear that Article 40. 3.3º cannot be used again in any circumstance to allow an injunction to be placed. Cases are sometimes referred to courts but we want to ensure that in regard to the element of travel the issue will be disposed of in a satisfactory way. Deputy Owen raised the question of assisting a person. This is an important matter which I considered at some [423] length. Once it has been agreed that there is a constitutional right to travel in any circumstance for a service that is available in another state, anybody who assists a person, in doing so cannot be judged as having committed a wrong. The whole question of freedom to travel relates to going abroad to seek a service that is lawfully available in another jurisdiction.;2627188

[424] I move amendment No. 2: In Part I, page 6, line 4, to delete 'stát' and substitute 'dlínse', and In Part II, page 6, line 7, to delete 'state' and substitute 'jurisdiction'. 3. In Part I, page 6, line 4, after 'eile' to insert 'nó saoirse chun seirbhís a fháil atá dleathach sa dlínse eile sin', and In Part II, page 6, line 7, after 'state' to insert 'or freedom to receive a service lawful in such other jurisdiction.' I hope I will not be accused of nitpicking, but we are trying to devise a form of words which is suitable. As we have discovered, single words have great importance in this debate. The intention of the amendment to delete the word 'state' and to insert 'jurisdiction' is in the interests of clarity. I will be interested in hearing the Minister's view because I am advised that a great number of places are not states — they are territories, dependancies, colonies or jurisdictions. We are trying to confer a general right on people — women in particular — to move wheresoever they choose from this State. To ensure absolute clarity on this issue I am advised that the word 'jurisdiction' is preferable to the word 'state' so that there will not be any ambiguity about travelling to certain areas of the world. For example, Hong Kong is not a state, it is a crown colony, and numerous other places have a different legal status apart from being an independent state. We are trying to establish the right of free movement of Irish citizens in relation to where they wish to go.;2627191
1091;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;I do not have any difficulty with the intent of the Schedule, that the subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between this and another state. However, I query its necessity, either arising from the decision of the [425] Supreme Court or because of the fundamental rights which attach to any democratic state. The Minister said that there was a need for it on the basis that the Supreme Court had decided by a three-two majority that while an injunction will not be given to restrain a woman from travelling abroad to obtain an abortion where there is a real and substantial risk to her life, obviously such an injunction can be given to restrain travel abroad to obtain an abortion where there is no such risk. I have copies of the judgment with me they are the only copies available in the Houses of the Oireacthas. I want to quote from them because if we purport to amend our Constitution to include what has always been there — and what has not been changed by the Supreme Court decision — we are doing something unnecessary. I will start with the judgment of Chief Justice Finlay. He dealt first with what is called the substantive issue and he said at the end: It is for this reason that, in my view, the defendants were entitled to succeed in this appeal and the orders made in the High Court— Deputy Howlin rose.;2627192

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Jim Tunney;Fianna Fáil;I will anticipate the Deputy. I was about to suggest to Deputy O'Kennedy that, if we disposed of the amendment initially, we could then come to the subject proper.;2627193
1093;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;The point I am making is valid and relevant when talking about a 'jurisdiction' or the 'state'. It does not change my submission. The Supreme Court decided on the substantive issues and the Chief Justice said: It is for this reason that, in my view, the defendants were entitled to succeed in this appeal and the orders made in the High Court have been set aside. He went on to say that the remaining issues are matters of some considerable interest. He said: These issues, however, having been [426] fully argued and being matters of considerable public interest, it seems to me that I should express my views upon them even though those views may fall as a matter of law within the character of Obiter dicta. In that case the Chief Justice did not make a judicial decision. I do not want to lecture the House but anyone who has any legal experience knows that obiter dicta, literally translated, means things said otherwise that are not related to the core of the judgment. Therefore, even taking the views expressed by the Chief Justice, which said that you could put the right to travel as a lower order than the right to life, it was just an opinion he did not make a decision. Mr. Justice Egan followed that position. Each of the other three judges pointed out the opposite. I will quote from some of the judgments. The late Mr. Justice McCarthy said in relation to the right to travel: Such a right has been identified in The State v. the Minister for Foreign Affairs as one of the unenumerated rights, all of which enjoy the same guarantee as contained for those expressed in Article 40º. If the purpose of exercising the right to travel is to avail of a service lawful in its location but unlawful in Ireland, is the right curtailed or abolished because of that local illegality and/or because of the guarantee in the amendment? This is where the question of jurisdiction comes in. He went to say: In my view, it is not a question of balancing the right to travel against the right to life it is a question as to whether or not an individual has a right to travel, which she has. It cannot be curtailed because of a particular intent. He went on to give very graphic illustrations. He said: If one travels from the jurisdiction of the State to another, one, temporarily, becomes subject to the laws of the other State. An agreement, commonly [427] called a conspiracy, to go to another State to do something lawfully done there cannot, in my opinion, permit of a restraining order. Treason is thought to be the gravest of crimes. If I proclaim my intent to go to another country — there to plot against the Government here — I may, by some extension of the law against sedition, be prosecuted and, consequently, subject to detention here but I cannot be lawfully prevented from travelling to the other country, there to plot the overthrow, since that would not be a crime in the other country. I go further. Even if it were a crime in the other country, if I proclaim my intent to explode a bomb or to shoot an individual in another country. I cannot lawfully be prevented from leaving my own country for that purpose. The reality is that each nation governs itself and enforces its own criminal law. A court in one State cannot enjoin an individual leaving it from wrongdoing outside it in another state or states. It follows that I agree with Hederman, J. that, in so far as the order interferes with the right to travel, there is no jurisdiction to make such an order. Therefore, Hederman J. clearly agrees with Mr. Justice McCarthy's interpretation. I now turn to the judgment of Mr. Justice Hederman on this issue because it was said that it was a three-two majority decision in relation to restraining the right to travel. However, it is very clear from the copy I have, initialled by Hederman, J., that he upheld the order of the Court at paragraphs (a) and (c) and that he did not make an order in respect of paragraph (b), the part of the order relating to the right to travel. He said very specifically: Therefore, this Court should not grant the injunction at (b) in the terms now sought by the Attorney General. Whatever views we have on the Supreme Court, it is important that we at least deal with the matter on the basis of the [428] reported judgments. It is clear that Judge O'Flaherty was of the same opinion: Having regard to the principles of interpretation that in my judgment should apply, the further question to be asked is whether officers of the State are obliged to invoke what may be called the police power of the State to interfere with the freedom of the individual, especially the individual's freedom of movement in and out of the jurisdiction. I leave aside the entitlement of the Oireachtas to enact legislation in regard to the provision and take it as self-executing in the absence of such legislation. I believe that its positive thrust is that the State should provide every practical assistance to pregnant women. The judge went on to say: The State's role in such a case should be a positive rather than a negative one. In particular, I do not believe that the Court should grant an injunction to interfere to this extraordinary degree with the individual's freedom of movement. In this instance, a negative role would be restraint on the right to travel. He also pointed out——;2627194

It is important that these matters be put on record. Judge O'Flaherty said: In this case the injunction granted also involves, in my judgment, an unwarranted interference with the authority of the family. The Supreme Court did not decide to interfere with the right to travel. Quite the opposite. There was one opinion from the Chief Justice, and he said it was [429]obiter dictum, and that was supported by Judge Egan. Unless my interpretation of words in their normal meaning is incorrect, the views of the other three judges as expressed in the judgments available in the Oireachtas Library are the opposite. I do not recognise the necessity for this amendment. I said in the House last night, and I shall conclude on this point——;2627196

I am sorry, but the Deputy is not going to baffle me. I am about to conclude my contribution. I do not recognise the need for this measure. If this measure were being introduced in a totalitarian state, in one of the former communist states in which the characteristic — as distinct from the characteristic of a democratic state — was that one was not free to travel, there would be good reason for introducing such an amendment. If this measure had been introduced in Russia, Bulgaria, East Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Albania or China there would be good reason for introducing an amendment to whatever constitution they had, because the characteristic of those states was that people were literally imprisoned within them there was no freedom of travel. We, however, live in a democracy and countless millions of Irish people have consistently exercised that right. It is for that reason that I do not acknowledge the necessity for this amendment. Neither do I consider that such necessity arises from the Supreme Court judgment.;2627200

He has made his comment on this matter in other places as well. One does not have to agree with every Deputy's point of view many people disagreed with different points of view expressed in the House yesterday and the same could apply to today's debate. I should, however, like to put it to Deputy O'Kennedy that the vast majority of those in the House wish to have this matter dealt with and dealt with in the only perfectly satisfactory and safe way, by referendum. The holding of a referendum will put beyond doubt any question in so far as the right of freedom to travel is concerned for pregnant women or for women or men in general who wish to leave this country under any circumstances. That is the reason that the matter is being pursued by way of referendum, and that was agreed earlier this year between the leaders of the parties, who recognised that the issue was one that should be attended to. It was unanimously agreed by them, and I think it is virtually unanimously agreed by everyone in the House, that the issue should be dealt with by way of referendum.;2627206
1106;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Brendan Howlin;The Labour Party;Clearly, it is not quite unanimous.;2627207
1107;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I am not so sure about that. Deputy O'Kennedy may feel that it is not as necessary to deal with the issue in this manner as Deputy Howlin feels or as I feel. Deputy O'Kennedy may feel that there is a grey area which might mean that the measure need not be attended to at all, and perhaps he would get support for that view if it were canvassed outside. However, that would certainly run counter to much of what has been said in the House in trying to reach a decision which would make sure that we did not face any further tests in the matter when somebody referred a case to the Supreme Court or to any other court or when an injunction was sought for any other reason. That leads me back neatly to the point made by Deputy Owen. We are trying to establish that nobody can be injuncted from going to seek a service anywhere outside the State and that anybody who would assist that person in any regard could not be prevented from doing so. That is what the Government are seeking to achieve in the proposed wording. We are trying to put beyond any doubt that Article 40. 3.3º or any other Article could be used to stop anybody from travelling in a free democratic way to avail of a service that is provided outside of the State. Deputy Howlin moved an amendment in relation to the State. I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands will ensure that a woman who wishes to travel to another jurisdiction to avail of a service that is unlawful here but is lawful in the other jurisdiction will have the right to do so in the sure knowledge that an injunction may not be taken against her to stop her travelling. We unanimously agreed that that was the key objective we should seek to achieve. Reference was also made to the fact that the courts have held that the unborn is implicitly protected by provisions of the Constitution apart from Article 40. 3.3º so that those other provisions could be relied on in a travel injunction case since the proposed amendment relates only to the limiting of the scope of Article 40. 3.3º. It is true that before the enactment [432] of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which inserted that Article in the Constitution, it had been pointed out by Judge Walshe in the Magee case that Article 40, Section 3, of the Constitution as it then stood, could be invoked to protect unborn life. However, as was stated by Judge Hederman in the X case, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was quite clearly designed to prevent any dispute or confusion about the application to unborn life of Article 40 as it stood before the passage of the Eighth Amendment, under which unborn life had a guarantee of protection and which went further and expressly guaranteed equal protection to the life of the mother of the unborn life. The right to life of the unborn is now explicitly recognised and guaranteed by Article 40. 3.3º and that explicit guarantee has been held to take precedence over the right of a mother to travel when she intends to leave the State to have an abortion and there is not a real and substantial risk to her life. If the people, by referendum, now decide that that express guarantee is not to limit freedom to travel outside the State, surely it is fanciful to suggest that the courts would circumvent that expression of the will of the people by reverting to a possible implicit guarantee of the right to life of the unborn that has been referred to in a case prior to the creation of the express guarantee of Article 40. 3.3º. I am advised that reference to Article 40. 3.3º in the proposed Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is sufficient to achieve the aims of that Bill. Deputy Howlin referred to the question of the State as against jurisdiction. We do not see any difficulty there, so far as matters referred to in the Constitution would refer to the word 'State' in the circumstances of our arrangements internationally on behalf of the State. Article 29 refers to the executive power of the State. We do not see that it would cause any difficulty.;2627208

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I should like to make a further point about Article 29. Article 29. 3 states: Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States. We are satisfied that that does not cause any difficulty in so far as the jurisdictions are concerned. It seems to me to be explicitly stated in Article 29. 3 and we rely on it.;2627212

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;I should like to refer back to one of the points I made earlier. The Minister is beginning to satisfy me that there is no other Article under which somebody can assist a person to travel to have an abortion which is illegal in this country but which would be legal in the state to which they are travelling. He said that under Article 40. 3.3º we are giving precedence to the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which will supersede the right to life if somebody claims that a person cannot travel for an abortion. The right to travel would be the overriding principle on which somebody would be able to travel and not the fact that they were going to have an abortion. Am I correct in that assessment?;2627213

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;Under Article 40. 3.2º what is the position of the boyfriend, husband or father of a potential child who decides to vindicate the right to life of the unborn in this State by saying that he is convinced that the woman carrying [434] the child is going to abort that child? That is what happened after the X case where a man was known to have sought an injunction to prevent his girlfriend from having an abortion — she wanted it but he did not. We do not know what happened in that case because publicity about it faded away and we do not know whether it was pursued. That is another scenario where we could end up in court. I should like to read a comment from The Cork Examiner of 19 October 1992 by a senior lecturer, Mr. J. Paul McCutcheon of the University of Limerick in which he stated: Ultimately, the authoritative interpretation of constitutional provisions is that of the courts and any attempt to explain the meaning of the proposals is an exercise in legal futurology. Obviously, even in what we are doing today we have to be careful not to use words such as 'certain', 'certitude' and 'absolute', etc.;2627215

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;We did in fact consider that issue. The idea of futurology comes down to the fact that any citizen can take himself or herself off to the courts and seek to get an interpretation on any aspect attached to this legislation whether in ordinary legislation or constitutional law. Without seeking to be short with the Deputy, we did discuss this issue and considered the very points the Deputy has raised, where there was a question of assistance for somebody seeking to prevent somebody from doing something they wanted to do. That is the whole purpose of the amendment as it is now framed. The amendment makes no exception — that is the key phrase. In other words, as the Deputy suggested, if somebody wishes to travel abroad for whatever service is lawfully available [435] they are free to do so irrespective of what anybody else would wish the person to do. We are satisfied about that. As I said previously, if that had not been the case it would have required an enormously different type of amendment and I would not have shirked from it if I felt that was the case. We feel this covers it neatly and we have been so advised.;2627218

He sees it from a different angle but it is already there as something fundamental one way or the other. His point is that this amendment is not necessary at all. What I am saying is that agreed wisdom and virtually the unanimous position of the House is that this amendment is necessary to put the matter beyond doubt. As Deputy Fennell said, people cannot and will not be restricted in any way. Deputy Howlin's point is well taken. This situation did not happen before.

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Brendan Howlin;The Labour Party;Tairgim leasú a 3: I gCuid I, leathanach 7, líne 4, 'nó saoirse chun seirbhís a fháil atá dleathach sa dlínse eile sin' a chur isteach tar éis 'eile', agus I gCuid II, leathanach 7, líne 7, 'or freedom to receive a service lawful in such other jurisdiction' a chur isteach tar éis 'state'. I move amendment No. 3: In Part I, page 6, line 4, after 'eile' to insert 'nó saoirse chun seirbhís a fháil atá dleathach sa dlínse eile sin', [439] and In Part II, page 6, line 7, after 'state' to insert 'or freedom to receive a service lawful in such other jurisdiction'. This amendment relates very much to the point made by Deputy O'Kennedy. As he rightly said in the essence of his contribution, only two judges would have been prepared to give an injunction in relation to travel. If one reads the judgments in detail, that seems to be the import of them. Only two judges out of the five, a minority, would have been prepared to give an injunction against travel while three judges would have made an order to prevent the woman or girl from having an abortion. This amendment seeks to clarify a very important point. Characteristic of the debate which has been taking place outside this House for a long time are the euphemisms used — we speak about 'the right to travel' when we mean the right of women to travel abroad for abortions and 'the substantive issue' when we mean abortion. We should talk in specifics, not generalities. It should be clear at the end of this debate that there is no possibility of an injunction being taken against somebody who travels abroad for the purpose of procuring an abortion which is lawful in another member state. That is the import of this amendment. It seeks to include the words 'or freedom to receive a service lawful in such other jurisdiction' in Part II of the Schedule. There has been much comment about this issue. The essential point in the original judgment in the X case, is that Mr. Justice Costello granted an order giving an injunction against the person concerned leaving the State and also against the person procuring an abortion.;2627251

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Brendan Howlin;The Labour Party;Let me deal with the issue step by step. That is the case which initiated these amendments. There is [440] every possibility that that injunction could still be made under the wording before us. I am afraid that this might be the case. I am not sure that the Supreme Court set aside every aspect of the Costello judgment. I wish to have the position clearly stated so that people who vote on the issue of travel will be clear in their minds that no Irish woman or girl who travels abroad for the purpose of obtaining a legal abortion in another jurisdiction can be injuncted or prosecuted for doing that. In this regard it is salient to quote the comments made by Mr. Anthony Whelan, a senior Trinity College law lecturer, in an article in The Sunday Business Post on 11 October. The article states: Whelan said that part of the Supreme Court's ruling in the X case was that under Irish law a woman was only permitted to terminate her pregnancy outside of the jurisdiction, where it did not conflict with Article 40. 3.3 of the Constitution guaranteeing the equal right to life of the mother and unborn child. This means that abortions in England are lawful only in circumstances which would be deemed lawful in this country, rendering the right-to-travel amendment irrelevant to the legality of foreign abortions. 'By travelling abroad to have an abortion which you weren't entitled to get here, you will still be committing an unlawful act,' said Whelan. Those are the comments made by a senior law lecturer on the wording before us. The Labour Party are seeking in this amendment to remove any ambiguity in relation to this matter so that we can state explicitly that the right exists for any Irish woman to travel abroad to avail of abortion services which are lawful in another member state. I am anxious to hear the Minister's comments on this amendment.;2627253
1153;An Bille um an Tri&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;I wish to address my remarks to amendment No. 4, the intent of which is the same as amendment [441] No. 3. To a significant extent we have already referred to the issues we want to raise under this amendment and the protections we are seeking. We are seeking to guarantee women living in Ireland, whether they are Irish women or foreign women — many women living in Ireland are not citizens of this State — the right to travel to Britain primarily. I take the Minister's point that the amendment provides for travel to any other state, but it has to be acknowledged that the vast bulk, if not all, of women who travel abroad for an abortion go to Britain. We are seeking to guarantee women the right to travel for an abortion. However, the Minister's amendment does not specify this. We are afraid that Article 40. 3.3º could be read as giving a superior right to the foetus over that of the right to travel. As Deputy McCartan said, Article 40. 3.2º has a relevance in this case. Article 40. 3.3º gives the foetus an equal right to the right of the woman. The right of the woman derives from Article 40. 3.2º which states: The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen. Article 40. 3.3º gives the foetus an equal right to the woman in relation to that Article. It seems to me that the right to travel could be regarded as less important to that right. It is for that reason we are seeking to incorporate wording which says that the right should be specifically for an abortion, for the services — the euphemism being used in the debate and the amendments — of abortion in another state. Despite the wishes the Minister and we may have, unless we copperfasten our intention the wording will be open to challenge and different interpretations. The Minister does not believe that after a referendum a woman against whom an injunction would be sought could be legally restrained from travelling from the State. I wonder on what [442] he bases that assurance. If a person goes to court and obtains an injuction, temporary or otherwise, against a person travelling to Britain for an abortion, surely the State has an obligation to restrain that person from travelling and to take whatever steps are necessary, particularly if the person who obtained the injunction has made it clear to the court that the person against whom the injunction is granted intends to travel on the 8 a. m. flight to Heathrow the following morning. In such circumstances the State would have an obligation to enforce the court's injunction by restraining that person. I question the Minister's categorical assurance that persons could not be interfered with in that way. Regardless of the final outcome of the court case, a person could be restrained on an interim basis. We are seeking to guarantee the right of women to go to Britain to seek an abortion even where that abortion may be unlawful in this State. That is the crux of the matter. The reason we are here is that the Supreme Court found that they could in certain circumstances prevent a person from travelling to another jurisdiction.;2627254

We are trying to rule out that risk. On that basis the Minister should consider the wording we are putting forward. One other reason we are here is that the Government, in their wisdom or otherwise, incorporated a Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty which sought to exclude Article 40. 3.3º from the consideration of the European Court. That also has a bearing on the case we are making. Even still it is not clear what effect that Protocol will have on what we [443] are doing and on the outcome of the referendum. Regardless of our decision, will women not have recourse to the European Court because of the Protocol? It is another angle of the uncertainty that surrounds this issue.;2627256

An injunction was taken and that injunction arose out of Article 40. 3.3º and an interpretation thereof. This amendment simply provides that Article 40. 3.3º cannot be used to pursue an injunction again. That is important. The general understanding is that to prevent such a thing happening again in any circumstances it should be specifically laid down. The best way to do that is to put a provision into the Constitution in a simple way providing that the Constitution gives unrestricted freedom to travel in any and every circumstances. That will achieve what Deputy O'Kennedy [445] says is already there. The people are anxious to have it stated in that way.;2627273

We recommended to the Government in that regard that it was not necessary. It seemed inconceivable to us that a court would give an injunction against a woman having an abortion when it cannot prevent her from travelling by invoking Article 40. 3.3º. Why would anybody be injuncted when nothing can take precedence over the right to travel as laid down in this amendment? It is not a question of being beyond reasonable doubt. We are simply satisfied that the right to travel supersedes everything in so far as Article 40. 3.3º or any other Articles of our Constitution are concerned. It is a good reassurance to be able to give.;2627275

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;It is important to point out that even in the Grogan case, which was dealt with in the European Court of Justice, there is no absolute right to information. The provision of information has to be subject to appropriate conditions laid down in national law. That is the [478] point I am getting at here today. Following the endorsement of the Fourteenth Amendment by the Irish people legislation will be needed. Our freedom to set down our position in national law remains with us. We can do this in certain circumstances. This issue will be covered in the legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Health. Certainly, circumstances will change they will change quite dramatically following the expected endorsement of the Fourteenth Amendment. So far as information was concerned things changed quite dramatically after the X case and the Supreme Court judgment. The parameters of this have not yet been outlined, and this legislation will attend to the matter. That is the important point. As I said, there is no difference of opinion between the Minister for Health and myself as to how this should be done. We are simply saying that referrals will not be permitted but all options will be made available in so far as information is concerned. It will then be a matter for individuals to make up their minds. The Minister for Health has indicated that he wishes to contribute later.;2627278

For example, if I want to provide information on the availability of tractors in Britain, there is no obligation on me to have a commercial link with a company in Britain in order to provide that information. Their decision related only to the specific case of abortion information as it related to Article 40. 3.3º — they have no automatic right to provide this information without a commercial link. I wonder whether a similar decision would [479] have been made if the case had been brought to the European Court of Human Rights. Of course, that was not done, and I do not know whether it might have been done. Will the Minister clarify — this point has not been clarified to date — if the Government's proposal on information goes through, will the necessity for a commercial link so far as the European Court is concerned still apply in relation to abortion information or will it be overcome by the current proposal? To put it another way, the proposal we are discussing does not oblige a commercial link to exist it just says information.;2627281

My amendment seeks to insert after 'information' the words 'counselling or assistance' in order to seek clarity in relation to what will be lawful in the State. In relation to the whole issue of abortion there will be unanimous acceptance of the need for counselling for somebody involved in a crisis pregnancy. It should be explicitly stated that counsellers involved in that activity would have the protection of law. We have already had some discussion on the word 'assistance'. Deputy Owen raised it in relation to the previous Bill. I have in mind, for instance, a child who is pregnant being assisted by parents. Would they and those involved in arranging travel be above possible legal action in relation to the assistance they would afford the child in procuring an abortion? We want to ensure that no third party involved in counselling or in giving assistance would be subject to prosecution as a result.;2627285

1186;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;This is the problem in regard to directive and non-directive counselling. There is a view that somewhere outside this House there is a group of people involved in a conspiracy to send as many Irish women as possible to England to have abortions. It is total nonsense that a group of people who want to be directive are pushing people into having abortions. I do not know of any group who have that view. I know there are groups who have provided voluntary services for women faced with crisis pregnancies and who have told them that if they cannot complete their pregnancies the option is to go to Britain and have them terminated. I am unaware of any group who do that without also giving the other options available, telling women that if they can complete their pregnancy adoption is an option and indicating the support services which would allow a person to remain here and keep the child. We have supports such as the unmarried mother's allowance, but we do not have the coherent social action programme we need. I am a member of Dublin County Council. Until the housing crisis reached its present state under this Government, we were able in 1986-87 to offer reasonable housing accommodation to unmarried mothers. They were not left at the bottom of the list, isolated in bedsitters with no social supports and paying exorbitant rents. It is no longer possible to provide for such people. Some local authorities cannot provide housing for married couples with three or four children. We must not get hung up on the question of directive and non-directive counselling. I do not want people to be encouraged to have abortions. Neither do I want a law which is so oddly phrased that a counsellor who tries to provide encouragement not to terminate a pregnancy is out of line because such encouragement constitutes directive counselling. That is a very odd way to proceed. The problem is that we do not know what will be in the legislation. I can parse and analyse the speeches of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health [482] and suggest there is a difference between the two speeches. There did seem to be a degree of difference and confusion between the two Ministers, but that may be unfair. The difficulty is born of the fact that we do not have the legislation. We do not know the specifics of what the Minister intends to produce. If somebody has a crisis pregnancy, information means not only explaining how to keep the child, the supports which are available and the option of adoption or abortion it also includes giving some information to the person who opts for abortion about reputable places in Britain, as opposed to allowing that person to travel to England and go to a place which is not reputable, with the attendant risk to health. I am greatly confused about what the Minister for Justice is saying. He has said that people engaged in counselling can go as far as presenting the options but cannot give the woman the name and address of a reputable place if she has to opt for abortion. Is that the giving of information or is it a 'referral'? The Minister for Health was more comprehensive in that he seemed to say that if a person opts for abortion a counsellor can tell her where she should go. The Minister for Justice seems to say that this cannot be done because it is a sort of referral. I want to see a rapid decline in the number of Irish women having abortions in England. For those people who take those options, I would rather they were referred by responsible agencies or medical practitioners to somewhere that deals properly with women and properly engages in further counselling before a termination takes place, than that they be simply left to their own devices to pick up some glossy magazine and get an address of some clinic which might not be the right place to go at all. We need to clarify this. The Minister for Justice has a problem. We keep talking about 'referral' which is supposed to strike horror into the heart. What does 'referral' mean? It may simply mean giving a name and address but it may mean something more than that. The only other meaning referral can [483] have in the medical context as Deputy O'Connell will know is that a GP, as is usual when referring a patient to a specialist, does one or two things. He either gives the patient a letter or gives him a letter and rings the specialist out of concern for his patient, in order to make the specialist aware of a particular medical condition which may be of relevance. That is what referral normally means and there are sound reasons for it. The reason is that the GP has perhaps been caring for the person for a number of years and is aware of the general medical history and believes it is something the specialist must know in determining what type of treatment might be appropriate. The referral may contain basic information, for example with regard to allergies to particular drugs. If the doctor knows that a person reacts badly to penicillin, he will give that information as well as perhaps information on the patient's blood grouping. If someone is a haemophiliac requiring particular treatment the GP will certainly say that in a referral letter. If a pregnant woman makes that awful choice of going to England to terminate a pregnancy, what function will referral have in addition to giving a name and address? Its only function will be so that a medical practitioner in Ireland can ensure that the doctor from whom she will seek help in England will also know the woman's medical history in so far as it is relevant. Are we saying that it will be against the law here, not under this amendment but ultimately under the legislation, for a general practitioner whose patient opts for a pregnancy temination in England, to give a letter of referral or to make a phone call of referral so as to ensure that the hospital, clinic or doctor with whom the patient consults in England is aware of the relevant medical history? That is the only thing I can see as a referral. We need to clarify that.;2627287
1187;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;Amendment No. 2 seeks to insert after 'services' the words 'drugs or preparations'. In relation to the question of information, when amendment 40. 3.3º was proposed in this House and when it was campaigned for outside of this House we were assured that it was not intended to change anything, that nothing would change in relation to medical practice or with regard to the current position in Ireland at that time in 1983. We were assured that the only purpose was to make sure that at no point in the future could abortion be legalised in this State without the matter being referred to the people. We know that since 1983 quite a lot has changed, that students have been hounded through the courts of this State and they had to go to the European Court [448] in order to try to establish the right to provide information on abortion. We know that books have been removed from our library shelves as a result of complaints that they contained information relating to abortion. We know that there have been complaints about various magazines which contained information about abortion. I know that quite a number of magazines in Britain which circulate in this State censor themselves in relation to various matters that they publish. I am thinking specifically of magazines aimed at women, in some cases young women, which run articles on the health of women. I have examples where these magazines excised sections of the magazines for sale in Ireland. The fact is that Article 40. 3.3º has changed quite a considerable amount of practice in this State. The Open Door counselling service was closed down as a result of actions by SPUC in court. The Guardian was stopped at our national airport and was refused distribution by Easons, the people who normally distribute it, because they feared that they would be prosecuted because it contained an advertisement for the Marie Stopes clinic. The need to establish the right to information is an important one which is probably supported broadly in this House. I have to draw the attention of the House to the underlying hypocrisy of our position as a society. We are quite prepared to ban abortion in virtually every case where the need may arise and to specifically ban suicide as a ground for abortion, but we are prepared almost unanimously to agree that a woman will have the freedom to travel anywhere she likes to have an abortion and that she may have information, albeit in fairly restricted circumstances, on where those abortions may be had. Providing abortion in this State is regarded as impossible. I would draw the attention of the House to a question which I put to the Minister for Health on 21 October. I asked the Minister for Health the number of women in this jurisdiction who had pregnancy terminations in Britain in the [449] latest year for which figures were available, the services, if any, which are provided by the health boards in this country for post-termination health care or counselling where this is required, and if he would make a statement on the matter. The reply, I received is interesting. It is as follows: In 1991, the most recent year in respect of which data are available, 4,152 women resident in the State had pregnancy terminations in Britain. In relation to the health and welfare needs of such women a broad range of services are currently provided by each health board. In the case of medical needs, obstetric and gynaecology services are available in public general hospitals which can be availed of where necessary. As regards psychological and counselling services, the necessary support services are provided in each health board area by multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, community psychiatric nurses and social workers. Additionally, valuable support services and counselling are provided by voluntary agencies which are in receipt of specific funding in that regard from my Department. The only comment I can make on that reply is that apart from the statistical fact that there are 4,152 women resident in the State who had pregnancy terminations in Britain in 1991, the reply is a load of nonsense. I have been in touch with health board officials and there are no such services available for women. What I have been told is that if by chance a social worker comes across a woman who has had an abortion she will be referred to the Rape Crisis Centre. For the Minister for Health to try to cod us into thinking that there is already in place a range of services that will counsel women on the question of abortion, or even on alternative options, is to mislead this House in a grievous way. I have to question the bona fides of the proposal here which is seeking to make it constitutional that information will be [450] provided with certain legal restrictions. I do not want to get into the issue of whether or not there is a difference of opinion between the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health on the issue of the provision of information. That is not a worthwhile avenue to go down. However, it is worthwhile to question what precisely is being proposed. Statistically, in 1991 4,152 women had abortions and everyone of them needed counselling before she stepped on a plane, weeks before she stepped on a plane, and certainly every single one of them needed counselling when she stepped off that plane again. From my information not a single one of them got counselling or help from the health services on which we spend hundreds of millions of pounds. It is left, broadly speaking, to groups who provide it on a voluntary basis. It seems that the health boards themselves use such services and refer people with such needs to those services. That is the first point I wanted to make. There is a large question mark over the seriousness with which the Government are addressing the issue of pregnancy termination in this State. We have a serious abortion problem in this country. The official figures are certainly understated because of the numbers of women who go to Britain and do not give their correct address but use addresses of relatives and friends resident in Britain. The figure is certainly understated. We are talking about at least 5,000 women this year who will have travelled to Britain for a pregnancy termination. We have an abortion problem in Ireland and we will have to deal with it. It is not sufficient simply to say that we will tell a woman where the abortion clinic is, that we will not allow the information to be put on bill-boards, that nobody will be allowed to distribute leaflets and so on. That is an entirely restrictive approach to the question of information and counselling. It is a narrow approach. I am not suggesting for a minute that there should be widespread advertising of abortion and abortion services in this country. I am not arguing for that at all. I am simply [451] saying that the mindset that sees the question of information solely on the basis of how it can be restricted rather than how it can be provided is starting from the wrong end of the spectrum of this problem. The Women's Information Network which, for obvious reasons, is based at a box number — they provide abortion information and if those involved in that work were to become known to the agents of the State they could be prosecuted as things stand — have provided Deputies in this House — I am sure I am not privileged in any way to get this information — with the results of a study which they carried out involving 2,000 women who contacted them about crisis pregnancies. It is clear from the information they got from the women who contacted them that the range of reasons women have for seeking an abortion are as many as there are women who seek an abortion. One of the most striking things to emerge from this information that the network provides is the almost universal terror women face when they are in this situation and the need for counselling of a compassionate kind to be available at the time they need it and not when a person may be reached at the end of a queue perhaps two or three months after the time when an abortion may be no longer possible. We have to address this issue not just from the legalistic point of view but from the point of view of what services the Government are actually going to provide at the end of the day, assuming unanimity in this House in relation to carrying the information provision and to judge by the opinion polls in the Irish Independent today it will be carried overwhelmingly. What services will then be provided by this State for the women who need this counselling before they get on the plane, and what services will be provided when they get off the plane? Having decided that we are going to shift this problem to Britain for the foreseeable future, the least we can do is to try to provide a caring service for women [452] who are faced with this appalling dilemma. Let me come to the amendment which I am seeking to move. It relates to including information on drugs and preparations as well as services. The reason I am proposing it is that it is generally understood that services refer to abortion and that, generally, is thought of as a surgical procedure. I am no expert in this area but certainly it requires hospitalisation for a period both before and after. It seems that this could certainly be regarded or classified as a service. There is now a new drug on the market I understand it is referred to as the R4U8 pill. This has been developed in France and is widely available there. I also understand that it is available on a limited basis in the United Kingdom at the moment but it is about to become widely available there. Quite simply, the R4U8 pill is an abortifacient. If a woman who wishes to terminate a pregnancy takes this pill up to six weeks into the pregnancy, the pregnancy will be terminated without the need for hospitalisation or surgical intervention. This will result in a major change in attitudes towards abortion and a huge drop in the statistics for abortions in France and elsewhere. I understand that this is occurring already in France. I understand also from material that I have read that the number of abortions in Europe is beginning to decline, but that is a separate argument. The reason I am seeking to have the words 'drugs and preparations' included in the amendment is that it is important, if women are to be counselled in relation to the services available, that they should equally be entitled to know that there is a pill available which would obviate the necessity to go to a hospital or clinic — in other words, there are different ways by which a termination can be carried out. It seems that the use of the R4U8 pill in the vast majority of cases would reduce dramatically the trauma for women who for whatever reason must go through the process of a pregnancy termination. I am seeking to guarantee in my amendment that women will be entitled [453] to receive all possible information so that they will be able to make a free choice, based on their health needs, social situation and so on. We should not get involved in the business of accusing each other of being in favour of abortion on demand, or of this, that or the other, because this House agrees that we should send our women to Britain for abortions — we may not have it here but we can send them to Britain. If we are going to allow them have the information and to travel, they should be entitled to receive all possible information about the options open to them. It is only a matter of time before this new preparation will be widely available in Britain and I am quite certain that it will be widely used there. I am seeking to guarantee that the amendment we are passing here will guarantee that women will be entitled to receive all such information and that it will not be restricted to the question of where the nearest clinic is in Manchester or London.;2627288

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;I have made the point and it is something the Minister for Health may wish to respond to. In the context of the Grogan case, in the area of information, I am at one with something the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, said last night, and which the Fine Gael Party said, and as I pointed out in a particular way last March when we were pressing the Government to hold referenda on the travel and information issues. We said that the sort of amendment the Minister is proposing — and we support the constitutional amendment — was the type of thing that was necessary, an amendment that would allow for the giving and obtaining of information and allow the Oireachtas to legislate. I agree with the Minister for Health that we do not want great big advertisement hoardings encouraging people to have abortions. Nobody wants that. The Minister is right — this area must be legislated for. In the context of obtaining information the Minister has explained to the House generally the current position in relation to the law as a result of SPUC v. Grogan, but what he has not been explicit about is that as a direct result of the SPUC v. Grogan case, under European law since the judgment in that case was delivered in October 1991, any commercial agency terminating pregnancies in any state in the EC has been able to advertise their services in this country. The Minister has not fully explained how the result of the SPUC v. Grogan case will interact with the constitutional amendment he is proposing, taken together with the legislation that is being talked about. There is one very express piece in the report of the SPUC v. Grogan case in the 1991 3 [485] Common Law Reports at page 1990 where it says: The reply to the national court's second and third questions must therefore be that it is not contrary to Community law for a member-state in which medical termination of pregnancy is forbidden to prohibit students associations from distributing information about the identity and location of clinics in another member-state where voluntary termination of pregnancy is lawfully carried out and the means of communicating with those clinics, where the clinics in question have no involvement in the distribution of the said information. It is quite clear as a result of that case — and my colleague Deputy Owen when she interrupted the Minister raised this — that an agency that has a commercial interest can advertise here under European law and, it appears, can promote abortion services. That seems to be the direct result of the SPUC v. Grogan case and nothing we put into our Constitution can disrupt that. Our legislation can properly delimit the manner of promotion. I would like the Minister to tell the House how he sees the constitutional provision and the legislation working if the information change is approved by referendum, which I hope it is, in the light of the judgment in SPUC v. Grogan.;2627292

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;The Minister's speech says 'the amendment would not permit'. It is [486] the amendment, subject to the legislation that the Minister might bring in. I think that the wording which then goes on to describe what directive counselling is refers to abortion referral. Minister O'Connell's speech uses the word 'promote'.

1195;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;In relation to this amendment there is a number of issues that we need to tease out. Having studied their speeches I believe that there are some discrepancies and differences of interpretation between the statement made by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and the speech made by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell. We are dealing with semantics here. It seems the terminology used in their speeches — words such as 'directive', 'non-directive', 'information', 'all available options'— does not gel together. I would like the Minister to tell us where the line can be drawn between the giving of information and referral. Let me give a simple example. For instance, I could say to a person that there are many shops on Grafton Street. That amounts to information. I could say that Switzers on Grafton Street have a great line in men's coats. Does this amount to a referral and will I not be able to give this information to a person? Does this not come within the meaning of the concept of giving information? [454] The Minister stated in his speech on Second Stage: Directive counselling, as I understand it, is systematic guidance and advice and involves abortion referral. Non-directive counselling on the other hand, consists of the provision of information and does not involve abortion referral. According to the Minister for Health, non-directive counselling means 'setting out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision for herself'. Is that not what Deputy De Rossa said? For instance, when this new drug becomes available should it not be included among the available options to be made known to a woman in non-directive counselling? Therefore there are discrepancies between what the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, consider to be directive and non-directive counselling. I prefer to think that Deputy O'Connell's description is more in keeping with what the people want. He went on to say in his speech to hammer the point home that the proposed legislation will not only resolve the uncertainty surrounding the 1988 Supreme Court decision about doctors being unsure of the legal position but will go further in a positive way by linking the provision of abortion information in crisis pregnancies with the provision of full non-directive counselling. Let us take as an example a pregnant woman who goes to her doctor or an advice clinic to find out the full range of options that are available to her in relation to her unwanted pregnancy. What would the position be if, having been counselled by the doctor as regards her health and told of all the options, including adoption, carrying the child to full term and abortion, the woman decides that she wishes to avail of the option of abortion? Prior to 1983 some doctors said to women that abortion was available and gave them the name of a reputable clinic. Will a doctor now, in providing full information and non-directive counselling, have to say to a pregnant [455] woman that she will have to go out and buy a certain magazine or publication to get the names of some clinics, be they reputable or disreputable, where she will be able to have an abortion carried out? Are we not splitting hairs too finely? I am not saying that the doctor is referring the patient to a clinic but rather giving her information. I am not saying that he will telephone the clinic on her behalf to make an appointment, because this could be construed as a referral, but rather that he is giving information. The Minister should not say to people outside the House who do not want to see information being made available that the amendment will be so restrictive that nobody will be able to find out through the counselling system where they can go to have an abortion carried out. I would like the two Ministers to clarify what appears to be a difference of interpretation in regard to non-directive counselling. In the Minister for Health's speech he gave a list of multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, community psychiatric nurses and social workers. In the report of the Commission on Health Funding it is virtually impossible to find any mention of the psychological services health boards will need to implement the provisions of this amendment. It is my understanding from the Eastern Health Board, that there are no counselling psychologists, as opposed to clinical psychologists, who may be able to provide this service. Has the Minister for Health considered how this amendment will be implemented when it becomes law? If a woman walks into her local health centre and requests counselling the day after it becomes law, what will happen? Will a team of properly trained people be available to give such counselling? Will resources be made available for this counselling? We all know that there is a lack of resources in this area, particularly for the more select services required by a small percentage of our population. They are the poor relations in the health [456] services and I do not believe the structures are in place to implement the provisions of this amendment. We can say from the roof tops that such services are available but I do not believe that will be the case. The Minister referred to doctors and advice clinics. Will doctors provide free counselling services to medical card holders and private patients or will only private patients who can afford to pay for the service be able to avail of it? Will there be extra pressure on doctors who carry out this service? Has any research been carried out in that regard? Will a suicidal pregnant woman have to visit a doctor's surgery and wait with ten to 15 other people to see the doctor while he deals with patients who have an ingrown toe nail or some other minor complaint? When her turn comes will the doctor have to act as a counsellor? Those matters have not been dealt with in this legislation. With regard to the advice clinics and services the Minister referred to — but did not elaborate on — will these be new services financed by the Government or existing groups, such as marriage guidance counselling services, the rape crisis centres, and so on? We should be mindful of the lengths the Rape Crisis Centre had to go in order to get the Government to recognise the importance of their role. They had to go to great lengths to highlight the fact that their services were needed and that Government support was vital if the Government were not prepared to fund a direct public service in that area. We must have answers to those questions before this legislation is passed. If particular clinics are asked to provide these services will such services be free of charge and will the costs to such clinics be recouped from the Department? It is clear from the reply to a Priority Question put to the Minister yesterday that vast areas of our health services are grossly under-funded and put to the pin of their collar to provide even a minimal service. Many of those questions referred to orthodontic services and the fact that 15,000 people are waiting for treatment. [457] Our public health services will not be available to react to the terms of this amendment if it becomes law. If the clause regarding the risk to the mother's life because of self-destruction is removed, the Government must ensure that suicidal pregnant women can get immediate and urgent counselling to prevent them committing suicide or taking the boat to England. A few weeks ago I listened to a radio programme on which a spokesperson from a group, which I think call themselves 'Life Rescue', in a sort of boastful manner said that members of that group travel to England and stand outside abortion clinics. He stated that they had saved ten girls from the trauma of abortion in that way. Why were they there if counselling would have stopped those women from going to England to have an abortion? That makes a case for counselling here which might prevent women who are psychologically traumatised by an unwanted pregnancy going to England to have an abortion. In order to minimise the number of women who go to England to have abortions this service must be properly structured, properly funded and available at community level. Otherwise we are wasting our time and passing legislation that will be cosmetic and of no benefit. I do not believe that is what the Minister wants. I should like to refer to the article I quoted from The Cork Examiner by the lecturer J. Paul McCutcheon. What will be the position following 29 October when the European Court makes this decision? Obviously, the Minister does not know what the final decision will be, but it appears that the reason the students did not win their case was based on the fact that they did not have a commercial link with an abortion clinic. What will the position be if the Minister says today that a doctor must stop short of naming certain reputable clinics in the centre of London where patients will get good care? If that doctor has a commercial link with a particular clinic, will he be allowed to promote that clinic? If that is the outcome on 29 October a doctor need only create some type of commercial link with [458] a clinic, such as a small investment of, say, £10 or £100, and refuse what the Minister referred to as directive counselling. If the decision on 29 October allows for that commercial link, how does the Minister propose to handle it if he says that a doctor cannot refer people?;2627296
1196;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;The problem with the entire debate on this proposal — this has been well illustrated by the contributions made on it — is that none of us really knows what we are talking about in the sense that we do not know what legislation the Government intend to produce. We are talking around the problem, not dealing with the substance of it. There is general agreement in this House that a woman who becomes pregnant is entitled to have made available to her information on the options that exist. We are talking about directive and non-directive counselling in a somewhat confined way. My view of what constitutes directive or non-directive counselling may differ from somebody else's view. The Minister says that if the abortion issue is raised, counselling must be non-directive. There are many organisations on different sides of this debate and with different views about abortion who [480] engage to some extent in counselling. Even those organisations which take the view that ultimately the woman must make the choice as to the options she follows would generally be of the view that they engage in some degree of directive counselling in the sense that they ensure women are fully aware of the alternatives to abortion. If somebody has an unwanted pregnancy, she cannot be forced to stay in Ireland and have the baby. If she gets on a plane, we have no involvement in what then happens. Some people would be of the view, perhaps rightly, that a woman can be encouraged not to have an abortion by having explained to her the relevant support and social welfare services available and so on. I should like to see a decline in the number of Irish women having abortions in Britain. I do not have a laissez faire attitude to this. I dislike the hypocrisy of pretending we do not have a problem, simply because pregnancies are not terminated here. About 4,000 women who state they live in Ireland go to Britain every year for abortions. They are the official figures there are probably more. The Minister might be of the view that those who are counselling have an objective role to encourage people thinking of abortion not to follow that road. I would be very surprised if the Minister for Health or the Minister for Justice were of the view that one should not at least try to encourage women thinking of abortion not to proceed. Most of us would be of the view that one should try to encourage them not to have an abortion, but the ultimate decision will be made by the woman. If I as a counsellor discuss all the options and encourage a woman not to have an abortion, that is directive counselling. Is that illegal? Do the Government envisage putting legislation in place which will make it contrary to law, having provided people with options, to encourage them not to take the option of the plane to England for an abortion? If that is what the Government are saying, it is extraordinary.;2627297

1200;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pat McCartan;The Workers' Party;By passing all stages of the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the House has put in place the principle that we as a nation will facilitate Irish women who are pregnant and wish to have an abortion, for whatever reason, travelling to a neighbouring country — which in most cases is England — for the purposes of terminating the pregnancy without restriction. That is the essence of the Bill which has been passed by the House. Obviously, such women will be subject to the rules and regulations laid down in England with regard to the termination of a pregnancy. We have agreed an English solution to an Irish problem. If we agreed that in principle, surely the logic must be to follow it by putting in place all available information, counselling and assistance in this State to help women who want to avail of such a provision. That is the purpose in part of the Government's proposal now contained in this Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It seeks to set down, in principle, that because we will allow women to travel to England to have an abortion, that we should at least make available to them basic information relating to it. It is fairly clear at this stage that the motive force behind the Government in introducing this amendment in the first instance is, in fact, rulings that are pend ing from the European Court, and which are at such an advanced stage that I have no doubt that lawyers representing the State and the Attorney General are we [459] advised as to what those rulings will be. Therefore, we have no option but to at least provide information on services available in another State, particularly a member state of the EC. Although we are absolutely clear on the right of women to travel — and the Minister for Justice has been unequivocal about that — when it comes to providing information, the Government are indecisive. It is impossible to get a clear indication from any Minister or, indeed, any spokesperson for the Government, as to what they legislatively intend with regard to this provision once it is in place and that is regrettable. There is provision for the making available of information, but the Minister for Justice has a view on it, the Minister for Health has another and other commentators are indicating what it will mean or, unfortunately, what it will not mean. That is why I believe the amendments put forward by the Labour Party and by ourselves in Democratic Left are worthy of consideration in order to give some teeth to this provision. Regrettably we do not have for the purposes of debate the draft legislation that the Government promises will be available by the time the Irish people vote on 3 December. It seems remarkable that a sub-committee of Government has been agitating over this matter for over six months and could not make available basic draft legislation or outline what is intended to be included in the legislation once this amendment is agreed to. It does seem that as with everything else in this debate the Government are trying to have it both ways. They say that information will be available but then introduce restrictions that the Minister for Health heralded in the Family Planning legislation earlier in the year. These restrictions were designed to placate a very fundamental, reactionary view in the community, but had the effect at the end of the day of rendering ineffective — if not ridiculous — the particular legislation that he is trying to promote in the first place. The Minister for Health appears to be the person who will have the greatest [460] input into this aspect of the legislation as to the type of counselling or information that can be made available to women who want it in the tragic circumstances of crisis pregnancy. Therefore, I would ask him not to repeat the exercise that he foisted upon us in this House regarding the family planning legislation when he adopted an illogically narrow approach and virtually rendered that legislation ineffective. In allowing condoms to be widely available in retail outlets but not in vending machines where people could purchase the items themselves, the Minister has, in the light of the decision by major supermarkets and retail outlets not to stock these items, virtually rendered that legislation pointless. I hope the Minister has learned from that experience and when he draws up the final terms of the legislation in regard to information that he will not have introduced so many unrealistic restrictions as to render the legislation ineffective. There is one matter that is absolutely clear from the European experience and that is where adequate counselling, advice and assistance exist, the number of abortions decreases. In circumstances where women can be given assistance, information, advice and assurance, they can make decisions and will, I believe, opt not to have an abortion in Ireland or, indeed, in England in whatever circumstances may prevail. The request to amplify the term 'information' to include 'counselling', is made in order to help women address a crisis in the first instance, and I believe it will also have the effect that appears to be the Government's aim, to avoid abortion whenever possible. The issue also arises in regard to practical assistance. Anyone following the debate so far, and the various attempts by the Minister for Health to explain in the media, inside and outside the Chamber the provisions of this legislation will have a problem trying to understand exactly where the duties or entitlements of the public lie. The problem that may arise for people who provide airline or boat tickets is not an unreal proposition, given the uncertainty surrounding this [461] legislation. Information does not include the activities of people who make arrangements or provide a contact telephone number. It is difficult, as a previous speaker has said, to understand where information ends and referral begins. If I understand the Minister correctly, he does not want a referral service to be established in this State under this Article. I cannot see why he has difficulty with that, given the fact that the Government have made a decision that pregnant women in Ireland can travel to England to have an abortion in any circumstances, subject only to the restrictions they might encounter under the English regime on arrival there. That being the position and the unanimous view of this House, what is wrong, in principle, in providing a system whereby contact on behalf of the woman who is travelling can be made in advance. It would certainly help women to find the right service, the most clinically safe service and would allow for liaison between the services in regard to pre-counselling, obtaining advice from the English clinic as to what they require and in terms of liaison with the other counselling and support services in Ireland that are needed when she comes home. The Women's Information Network, that Deputy De Rossa has already mentioned, makes this point very clearly in the report compiled by them over the last four years of their work. I quote from the section on information in that report: British abortion clinics have commented that the lack of information has had direct negative medical consequences for Irish women. Often Irish women travel later in their pregnancy than would have been the case if the information was readily available to them. They are ill-prepared for the operation, often fearing they will be 'cut open'. This makes the procedure even more traumatic for them than it already is. Ironically, the lack of information also means that some Irish women arrive in Britain too early in their pregnancy for the operation to be [462] successful and put themselves at risk of an incomplete abortion. There is a great need not simply to provide basic information but also to allow that information to have meaning and support in the medical sense for women who we agree can and should not be hindered in travelling to Britain to have an abortion. That must involve liaison, counselling, referral and assistance in travelling. The point about people travelling too late is borne out in the figures of the National Statistics Office in Britain, published in September of this year. They state that of the women who attended for abortion in 1991, 12 per cent of those whose pregnancy was 20 weeks or longer were non-resident — not all of them were from Ireland — whereas 1. 3 per cent were resident in Britain. This is clearly related to the lack of direct contact and easy referral as well as lack of information. On health grounds the Minister, in a Government that agree in principle to allow women to travel to Britain for abortion, has a duty to provide for proper counselling for these women and to ensure that they travel to a location which is clinically safe. They should be given all the information necessary. The Government cannot have it both ways. Since we are sticking to the English solution of our problem, there is a duty on us to do the second best honourable thing and ensure that women are helped in this crisis. I hope that two other things will emerge as a result of agreeing to this amendment. First, a stop should be put to the pursuit of students through the courts who blaze the trail on information rights. I appeal to SPUC and other reactionary elements in our community who try to censure and deny information to women to stop persecuting people who simply want to disseminate basic information to women in crisis. An end should be put to these legal actions. I hope that the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice will join with me in congratulating our students for blazing the trail on this issue. We are now doing what they argued for, many of them doing so with the prospect of being brought before [463] the courts and subjected to huge legal costs arising from the actions they took. I hope that the chief librarian of Dublin city and county will return to the bookshelves of the city basic books on women's health and education with regard to fertility, particularly Every-woman's Lifeguide by Dr. Miriam Stoppard. That book was ignominiously withdrawn from the shelves of public libraries in Dublin by the chief librarian, who issued a memo to the district libraries stating: 'Please withdraw all editions of the above book [Dr. Stoppard's book] from stock and send to the Circulations Office with a worn-out Memo'. This ignominious act suggests not that women should not read the book but that it should not remain on the bookshelves because it is worn out. The public librarian was forced to go through that charade to meet the reservation of one member of the public who said there was something wrong with this book. Actions such as these must be stopped. The Minister should not heap more ridicule on us by trying to split hairs on such an issue. Information never hurts it can only help.;2627301

Since 1983 various court cases have resulted in the withdrawal of information, as has been described by Deputy McCartan. My first reaction to these was bewilderment that in a civilised, sophisticated democracy the machinery of the State would deny to adult women specific information or books. For example, The Guardian was withdrawn on a certain day because it contained an advertisement relating to this matter. For women like myself who have always striven for equal rights, the right to free speech and so on, it is unacceptable to have to tolerate and be subject to those restrictions. I am very pleased that at last we are taking measures to change this despicable situation which has existed for far too long. In my quiet moments I wonder what the position would be if the X case had not [464] arisen. Would we continue to put up with the position as it existed? We are at a disadvantage in that we do not know what will be in the legislation — I appreciate that it can only be a draft — but from listening to the contribution of the Minister for Health and statements made by him on a television programme I am reasonably happy that the making available of information will be unrestricted. I hope that a stop will be put to the Messianic campaign by many groups — I have no doubt they were well intentioned and they believed that what they did was correct — of pursuing students and other groups and organisations through the courts to stop them from providing necessary information to people in a crisis. I hope that the forthcoming referendum, which I have no doubt will be passed, will result in many people in pro-life groups becoming redundant and that they will be allowed to retire peacefully and happily. I hope that it will put an end to the setting of traps — most people in this House will know what I am talking about — one of which was set for me on the phone. Traps have also been set for a number of doctors in that a person impersonating a desperate pregnant woman visited or phoned the doctor saying that she was at the point of killing herself and asking for an address or information on abortion. I would not break the law but I certainly would help a person in this position. However, I hope that a stop will be put to the setting of these traps, that there will be no subterfuge involved and that proper information will be made available. The point has been well made by Deputy Owen about the need to make available to women a range of services of professionals such as psychologists, social workers and counsellors. In this context I am not very hopeful because we all know that women looking for basic contraceptive advice and information are ill served here we are far down the league in European countries in regard to making advice and information about contraception available. I hope, if the referendum is passed and legislation [465] enshrined, that the Minister will follow it up with realistic information outlets which will ensure that the women about whom we are talking — the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, said that 20 or 30 women had gone to England for an abortion since we started this debate —will be helped. Women can very easily find out whether they are pregnant I am amazed when I see advertisements in this regard. In my day, when I wanted to know if I was pregnant, I had to go to a doctor and bring a specimen for testing. It was not as clinical and cold as it is today when one buys a pack in a chemist shop and can find out very quickly if one is pregnant. I am not sure how the test operates but the result is known in 12 hours.;2627302

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;F;Ms. Nuala Fennell;Fine Gael;Women nowadays know they are pregnant almost before they miss a period. It can be a very cold, lonely exercise discovering that you are pregnant at 17 or 18 years of age, or at 44 years of age when you do not really want another child. There should be a point of contact for women in regard to which they feel comfortable, to which they will readily go and which will give them all the information they need. I stress the need for real information to be available. We should examine the position in Northern Ireland because it is not dissimilar to what we will have here. Of course it will be far more limited but I have a leaflet brought out by the Ulster Pregnancy Advisory Association which provides telephone numbers. It is readily available in doctors' surgeries and hospitals and it lists all the organisations, it deals with abortion and the law, how an organisation can help, what is involved in an abortion — which everybody should know well in advance — the practical situation with regard to the circumstances in which one would have an abortion, and travelling to England. It is very important to give the numbers of clinics because women will need to be directed [466] to reputable ones which will do a proper job and not overcharge. What will happen if a doctor has a conscientious objection in this regard? We would be very foolish to think that everybody will warmly welcome what we are doing. I have no doubt that there are very large pockets of resistance and I should like the Minister to indicate what will happen outside Dublin, Cork or Galway, in areas where a doctor will not become involved in imparting information and addresses. Does the Minister have a plan to deal with that point? Will women be referred to a central point and get information? I can see there could be great difficulty.;2627304
1204;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;I welcome the debate on removing the total ban and censorship on information. I am sure that the Minister also welcomes it because no one was comfortable with the fact that Ireland had reached the stage — because of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Eight Amendment — where magazines could not come into this country without containing blank pages and a little note to the effect that, because this was the Irish edition, it could not be the complete magazine available to other women — and indeed men — who read, say, Cosmopolitan to raise their consciousness in regard to these matters. It caused grave embarrassment and shame that a basic right to information had been removed because of the interpretation. We are doing something very positive in regard to the rights and freedoms of our people by reinstating the right to information. Other Members on this side of the House raised certain questions. I thought that we might have had to tease out 'directive and non-directive counselling' referred to in the speech of the Minister for Justice who said: Directive counselling, as I understand it, is systematic guidance and advice and involves abortion referral. Non-directive counselling, on the other hand, consists of the provision of information and does not involve abortion referral. Non-directive counselling [467] would clearly be covered by the right to obtain or make available information which is provided for in the amendment. Before the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty people gave non-directive counselling which included abortion. The point skilled professional counsellors made is that they would never involve themselves in directive counselling, of just referring people for abortion. They said that when they counselled women in regard to pregnancy they would make it very clear that they were not in any way influencing the person to opt for any particular choice. In an impartial way they left the options to the person, with support, but did not exert undue influence. In fairness to the counsellors, they have assured us that it would be totally unethical and unprofessional if they just advocated abortion. It would be a total negation of everything their skills and professionalism stood for. There is no need to be confused in regard to directive counselling. I should like to feel that there would never be crude, directive counselling which would be just another abortion referral. We all welcome the fact that we will now be able to restore to women in crisis pregnancies the opportunity to consult an impartial, skilled, professional person who will give them information from which they will be able to get enough knowledge and support to stop them choosing the option of abortion. All of us would hope for that. I want to point out the need for this kind of counselling, especially in Ireland. In a paper prepared by Professor Anthony Clare and Dr. J. Tyrell, Psychiatric Indications for Abortion—Are There Any?, it was stated: Certain groups do appear especially at risk from the adverse effects of abortion. Negative religious or cultural attitudes to abortion are associated with higher levels of post-abortion psychopathology. For example, Roman Catholics experience more guilt than Protestants and Protestants more guilt than Jews. [468] I am delighted to say that that statement is based on research. It is certainly not my personal observation.;2627305
1205;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I thought I was hearing things.;2627306
1206;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;I shall continue that quotation: Membership of a cultural group which is antagonistic towards abortion and sexuality is also identified as loading for poor outcome in a number of studies. Such findings are highly relevant to the Irish situation. Another statement made in that paper reads: Given the circumstances that surround the abortions undergone by Irish women — the fact that they have to be surreptitious, have to be performed in a foreign land and are regularly categorised as murder by religious and political critics — it is highly likely that many Irish women do experience profound, persistent and disabling psychiatric symptomatology following the terminations of their pregnancies in the UK. The implications in terms of the provision of appropriate pregnancy counselling and support... would point to a particular need for Irish women. I quote those statements to demonstrate that there is a real need certainly for counselling before a women chooses what option she will take in a crisis pregnancy and also, because of the special circumstances in Ireland, for counselling after an abortion for women who would feel the guilt and the isolation to which they are subject as a result of the situation in Ireland up to now. One of the fervent hopes that all of us would have is that resulting from counselling there would be a lower rate of abortion, much greater support and removal of the very grave and persistent feelings of guilt, isolation and secrecy experienced by Irish women at present. What recognition and funding will be given immediately to clinics already skilled and experienced in carrying out the [469] kind of counselling we are talking about? So far as I know, at the moment those clinics get no State funding. They rely on contributions, which has an impact on the provision of counselling for poorer women and women who cannot afford high consultation fees. I should like the Minister for Health to tell the House the way in which we are going to provide regional counselling as quickly and as effectively as possible. I know that there are several professional and well served clinics in Dublin that have a long experience and a code of ethics in this counselling, but we have to be concerned about women in rural areas. For rural women caught in crisis pregnancies not only time but also accessibility would be terribly important. We must ensure that regional advice and counselling are available so that women do not have to travel long distances or draw attention to themselves by having to take a whole day off work, for example, at a time when they may prefer to take advantge of that advice and counselling without the knowledge of the community and perhaps even the family. The concept of a total, supportive, psychological counselling service has to be taken into consideration. We will need skilled people in that area. The medical profession, who may feel that they have neither the skills nor the time to enter into this kind of counselling, should be able to refer easily and quickly women who would need that counselling immediately. Minister Flynn said that he would like the thrust of the measure we are introducing to be affirmative for women, not negative. I make a plea that the information and counselling also be affirmative rather than negative.;2627307

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. John Browne;Fine Gael;(Carlow-Kilkenny): We should be realistic about this matter. If we are not going to have places where pregnant women can go to get advice and information we are only putting a dalla mhullóg on everybody — we are just bluffing. I feel that the crunch will come when everything is over and the measure has been introduced. My colleague has raised a point that I wanted to bring to the attention of the House: I hope that the Government will not consider that they can fulfil their obligation by providing a centre in Dublin and expecting everybody to fall into line. If a woman sets out with the idea of having an abortion she will not want to go for advice to a church advice centre because she will feel — perhaps wrongly — that she will not be treated properly. If the same woman could go to another advice centre she might very easily, having heard the options, change her mind — as we have been told. It is important that centres be provided [471] throughout the country and it is important that the Government do not fall back on the churches, who are doing marvellous work in their own way, because that would be a cop-out for the Government. I would hate to think that once the legislation has been passed we will, because of other financial commitments, finish up with the same lack of services as experienced in other areas of health.;2627316

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;The Deputy initially raised a question about the chance of people being prosecuted if they were assisting in any way. Certainly that is not contemplated. That aspect was dealt with effectively in relation to the proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The same applies in this instance, and I am of the opinion that Deputy Howlin would wish it to be that way. Deputy De Rossa spoke at some length about the needs of pregnant women and particularly their need for counselling services. I was pleased to hear him say he is opposed to widespread advertising of abortion services, a point that has been re-echoed by many speakers. Many of the contributions, which centred around what will happen after the Amendment has been passed, were supportive. It is still only a Bill and the people have to decide on this matter. We are taking it for granted that they will give us an affirmative in this matter and that is something we hope for in all three referenda. In so far as this particular one is concerned there appears to be a great desire in the House that it would be recommended to the people in general [472] that they give us an endorsement of this Amendment. No objection has been raised in regard to the thrust of this Amendment. I am pleased to acknowledge that from the Deputies who have contributed. We cannot — and this has been recognised by the Deputies who contributed — have the legislation published for the obvious reason that one has to await the decision of the people. They have to decide that this is the way they wish to proceed and that this is what they want the Constitution to allow. It was in that manner we discussed it at the sub-committee and it was decided to recommend that a summary of the draft proposals would be made known, and that may be helpful. My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, has been helpful in that regard. I was particularly pleased to hear Deputy Fennell say she supports that in a broad way. In fact, everybody has agreed that it is the right thing to do but what we are really talking about is the kind of contribution they may well make on Second Stage or some other Stage when the proposals are actually published.;2627319

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;That is the point. I am talking about the summary of what we [473] would consider appropriate to put into those heads even though it is somewhat in advance of the agreement of the people to accept the amendment. That point must be borne in mind. It is a rather critical point and we would be very hopeful that Deputies would apply their minds to supporting the Amendment in a positive way outside so that an alternative view does not gain a grip that would not wish it to be endorsed by the people. We have heard much about what Deputies would wish to see happen following the publication and agreement by the House of legislation, following endorsement of the amendment and I know we will hear much more as time goes on. We were speaking about amendments Nos. 1 and 2 which are being taken together. I am opposed to amendment No. 1. It is slightly different from what we discussed for the past hour in so far as we dealt with services that may be provided — and hopefully will be provided — following the successful endorsement of the amendment and followed by the publication and agreement of the necessary legislation in so far as the House deems it necessary. This amendment to the Schedule of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill is being opposed. Both the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, and myself made it very clear in our contributions on Second Stage that the Bill permits non-directive counselling——;2627325

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;——but does not permit directive counselling. Directive counselling involves abortion referral. The intention of the Bill is to preclude that kind of counselling from being allowed in the jurisdiction. The Minister for Health has outlined the details of the legislation he proposes to bring forward for controls on the supply of information in the event of the Amendment to the Constitution, that is provided for in the Bill, being accepted by the people in the forthcoming referendum. I think we have all been taking that slightly for granted. I do [474] not take anything for granted in political life but I am hopeful, from what I have heard in the House today, there will be a positive result and it will require the legislation about which we have spoken. The Minister for Health made it clear that information will include that provided by a doctor or an advice agency to a pregnant woman who seeks the advice concerning her own specific circumstances. He also said it will be a requirement that in such circumstances information must be given in the context of non-directive counselling and the full range of alternative options available to the person concerned. That is the important issue to which Deputy Barnes referred. Let us be clear that there is no difference of opinion. The Minister for Health said non-directive counselling means setting out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision. It is important that a complete range of options be made available to them so that they know precisely what they were getting into. They would then be in a position to make an educated and informed decision. Freedom to obtain information regarding services lawfully in another state, which the Government's wording protects, clearly allows non-directive counselling.;2627327

1228;An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste. Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage.;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;My colleague pointed out that following the 1988 Supreme Court decision concerning information, doctors had been unsure of their legal position regarding counselling in a crisis pregnancy. In order to get around that difficulty and to put it in a way that everybody understands precisely what is proper in accordance with the law this legislation will be published in due course. The view of the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, is that the proposed legislation will not only resolve the uncertainty but will link the provision of abortion information in crisis pregnancies with the provision of full, non-directive counselling. The amendment proposed [475] by Deputies Spring and Howlin, which seeks to insert the words 'counselling and assistance' into the Bill would clearly allow directive counselling and abortion referral. The Government are of the view that a provision of that kind is unacceptable. That would not be in the public interest or in accord with the provisions of the Constitution. I would ask Deputy Owen to take it for what it is worth that there is no difference of opinion between what the Minister for Health stated in his contribution last evening and what I stated in the course of my brief reference to the matter in my earlier speech. My view, as expressed, is entirely consistent with what the Minister for Health said yesterday but I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify it further if that is necessary. From what I have heard Deputies on the opposite side say, there is no difference of opinion between us on basic fundamental matters in this regard. The EC court's decision was raised. The effect of the EC court's decision is that while lawful abortion in a state constitutes a service within the meaning of Article 59 of the EC Treaty, it is not contrary to Community law for a member state, in which abortion is forbidden, to prohibit the distribution of information about abortion services available in another member state where there is no economic link between the abortion service and the distribution of the information provided. The court did not make a specific decision but there was an implication that if there was such a link the distribution of the information would be permissible under community law. It is not so much a question of interpretation but of the way people understand EC law to operate in so far as commercial links are concerned. To put it in colloquial terminology, the students did not have the commercial link. Had it been formulated in a different way, they might have had by acting as agents for the commercial concern. Under EC law the provision of this service is a commercial concern. The provision of a particular service, which is [476] available and allowable under EC legislation, is regarded as a profitable business. It is proper and necessary that information would be provided in this way. One has to have a commercial link and, as I understand it, that is the reason the matter was adjudged in the way it was. The matter is not straightforward and it is recognised that member states have a margin of discretion within which to decide what should be permissible under national law. That is written into EC law. The EC Court has consistently held that Article 59 of the EC Treaty requires the abolition of any restriction which has the aim or effect of treating a provider of services established in a member state other than the member state where the service is provided less favourably on account of his nationality or place of establishment than a provider of services who is established in the particular member state. Article 59 is the key Article. It also requires the abolition of any restrictions which the recipient of services might encounter on account of his nationality or the fact that he is established in a member state other than that to which he goes in order to receive the services. It follows from the case law in the EC Court of Justice that not only the providers of services, who do so by way of trade or profession, derive rights from the Treaty provisions on freedom to provide services, but also Community citizens who wish to receive services. Of course, the question arises as to whether the right of Community citizens to receive services in another member state encompasses the right to receive unimpeded information in one's own member state about the provider of services in another member state. It appears that a prohibition on the distribution to persons resident in a member state of specific information designed to promote activities which are contrary to the legitimate public policy of that state, if performed there, may be applied even where the information invites persons to make use of those activities in another member state where the likely or intended result [477] of the provision of such information is to undermine that public policy. That is the general understanding in so far as Article 59 of the Treaty is concerned.;2627329

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;I had started to tease out further the whole question of what exactly [607] the Minister for Justice means by the term 'referral' as opposed to 'information'. He seems very coy — a term I would not normally attach to the Minister — about tackling the question which is being put to ensure that this amendment, if passed, will mean what it says and nothing else. The amendment would not permit directive counselling but would permit non-directive counselling. However, the wording of the amendment would not make that distinction. That will be done in the legislation. The words 'directive' and 'non-directive' do not appear in the amendment. Therefore the amendment per se will not distinguish between directive and non-directive counselling. With the greatest respect, we may end up allowing people to have information, counselling and support in a crisis pregnancy under a system which will finish up in a puff of smoke. That is why it is necessary for us to tease out the use of words in one speech or another. The Minister for Health got nearer to what we are trying to avoid, that is clinics in which the only information and advice a woman with a crisis pregnancy gets is to go abroad for an abortion. We do not want to see that sort of advice clinic. The Minister for Health when talking about books, magazines, radio and television said that such information will only be permitted in so far as it is factual in nature, and instead of leaving it there he went on 'and does not seek to promote abortion in preference to alternative courses of action.' The word 'promote' should be looked at carefully with regard to the legislation. It is a more meaningful word than 'referral'. The Minister should get his advisers to look at this. The use of the word 'promote' as opposed to 'referral' which is open to a number of interpretations would be much safer. For example, I can tell the Minister that there are lots of shops in Grafton Street and that is factual, but I can also say that one of them is called such-and-such and that it is great for men's overcoats, and that seems to be referral, but in fact it is just [608] further elaboration of the same information that there are lots of shops in Grafton Street. If, on the one hand, the law will permit factual information to be published in books or magazines, the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, said on 'Prime Time', the programme we shared on television, that would mean the names and addresses without any indication as to which is good or bad. Where does one draw the line in the doctor's surgery or in the advice clinic? A doctor may give a woman all the options he can and a woman may go away and think about it and then come back and thank the doctor for the names and addresses of CURA, the Rape Crisis Centre and so on, which were given because the person was pregnant due to rape in order to assist her to make a decision not to have an abortion. The woman may say that having considered all the advice she wants to have an abortion and wants the names and addresses of clinics which the doctor thinks would look after her properly in the circumstances in which she finds herself the doctor would refuse because he cannot go any further, although he can tell her to sit in his waiting room for ten minutes and read through Woman's Way magazine, or whatever, or some leaflets that are there. Is it necessary to put that onus on advice clinics so that they cannot actually say 'Here is a leaflet' such as the one Deputy Fennell showed us from Northern Ireland? When the Ministers are answering I want them to understand what we are trying to tease out. We are trying to make sure that a non-directive counselling service that becomes available with all the necessary resources will not be just some kind of a talking shop. I am not saying that it must refer people or promote anything but it must be useful. It must be of some benefit to the traumatised person seeking it. In most cases people will be happy to complete their pregnancies and deliver their babies safely. Let us look at the word 'promote' because the Minister, Deputy O'Connell, got closer to what we are trying to avoid [609] than the Minister for Justice did in the way he described non-directive counselling. Perhaps the Ministers would take a look at those issues.;2627565

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Jim Tunney;Fianna Fáil;Before calling Deputy De Rossa, I would again remind the House of the time constraint. We must adhere to the requirements of Committee Stage debate. We refer to what is in the Schedule and the amendments proposed which would alter that. If we are to indulge in projecting ourselves into legislation that has not yet appeared, or if we indulge too much in historical fact we are avoiding the opportunity we have of exchanging our views in relation to the present. That is what we should be doing. The Minister for Health to whom the Deputy addressed the questions has not yet addressed them here.;2627566

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;The reason we are trying to tease out the implications of what information will be available is because the Minister for Health very kindly outlined in the Second Stage speech the parameters within which he expects information will be available and the restrictions that will be placed on it. I have one brief question on that to which the Minister might reply. When the Minister makes a distinction between directive and non-directive counselling he is obviously saying to us on the one hand that no provider of information or counselling may direct someone solely in the direction of abortion, but is he also saying that no organisation such as CURA may ignore the option of abortion? If a person with a crisis pregnancy goes to CURA, a Roman Catholic organisation, will that organisation be obliged to outline all the options including abortion? That is a fairly straightforward question and I would appreciate it if the Minister would deal with it. I have not yet heard an answer to the query as to the definition of 'referral'. What is 'abortion referral'? What precisely do we mean by that and how do we distinguish between information and referral? When I spoke earlier I referred to an [610] abortion pill which is available in France and Britain and I gave it the incorrect title. It is actually RU486, and I understand there is a similar pill called the MIFEGYNE pill. My amendment seeks to ensure that services include that kind of service and would not exclude information on the range of abortion procedures that are available. As I understand it, the RU486 and the MIFEGYNE procedure is much less traumatic, primarily because it is administered in the early stages, within the first seven weeks in France and within the first nine weeks in England.;2627567

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;There are a couple of items to which I would like to refer. The Deputies really want the Minister for Health to say some other things. What we are really talking about and getting at the moment is advice as to how we would consider framing the legislation which has not yet been drafted. We have only indicated a summary of what the draft proposals might be and all of that is contingent on the endorsement of the Amendment to the Constitution which comes first. The legislation will be subsequent to that. It is useful all the same because 'information' is the key word here. For that reason I think the latitude is understood and, thankfully, understood by you too, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Let me make a couple of comments and then the Minister for Health might like to expand. The amendment we are talking about now will open up the right to provide and receive information concerning services available in other countries not merely in those cases where termination of a pregnancy is lawful in [611] the State but concerning all services lawfully available outside the State. I have made it clear that the Government are prepared to permit non-directive counselling but are not prepared to permit directive counselling. I am advised that the word 'information' in this Bill is sufficient, without any reference to counselling, to achieve that purpose. That explains the reference on Second Stage which Deputy Owen mentioned. In line with the Government's objective, the legislation which the Minister for Health proposes to initiate, should the people accept the proposal in the amendment, will provide for non-directive counselling and prohibit directive counselling. Under the legislation non-directive counselling will set out all the available options in order to let the person make the informed decision for herself. The Minister for Health and I are at one in our views on this approach. There is no divergence of view whatever between us on the matter, as appears to be suggested in a previous intervention by Deputy Owen. Let me refer to a matter that was raised by Deputy Shatter. He suggested that the amendment Bill could inhibit the counselling of a pregnant woman not to have an abortion. I want to reject that argument without hesitation. The implication that Article 40. 3.º3 could be used to inhibit advice to a woman that she should not have an abortion is clearly wrong because it would fly in the face of the whole tenor of Article 40. 3.º3 which is framed to protect the life of the unborn. The precise form of the non-directive counselling would be set out in the legislation. There was a point made about the commercial link. Deputy De Rossa made this point as well. The question of the commercial link was only relevant when people were claiming that they had rights under EC law to provide information. The question of commercial link becomes irrelevant once the amendment is made. Such a link was only relevant when the question of freedom of information under EC law was in question. Since the [612] proposed amendment will make information available under Irish law the question of whether or not there is a commercial link no longer applies. I think that is the point that Deputy De Rossa was making.;2627570

That is another key point. That is where the legislation comes in. States may impose restrictions to suit their own particular culture and quite a number of EC states have restrictions — and some of the restrictions are quite severe — on the supply of information about abortion. All of the other talk we have had then is following the amendment, the legislation, the areas of restriction and anything else one wishes to apply. For example, we do not want advertising on bill boards. That is certainly out. There are other areas which can be gone into when the legislation is being considered.;2627572

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Dr. John F. O'Connell (Deceased);The Labour Party;We will be talking about advice and guidance to a woman on continuing with her pregnancy, but we would not allow advocating abortion. There are a few points that were mentioned by a number of Deputies here on the question of referral or advocating. Factual information will be provided on the various options available to the person. Deputy Owen mentioned the possible role of health boards and other State agencies in providing information on abortion services. It is very important to make it clear that the proposed amendment relates to permitting people or agencies who wish to do so to provide such information within the legislative conditions that the Oireachtas may [614] decide. It does not imply that the State agencies will be providing the abortion information. I think Deputies would agree with me that it would not be appropriate that the State itself should provide information on services which are prohibited in this country, so it would not be State agencies that would be providing the abortion information. On the wider issue, the need to make sure that adequate support services are available for people undergoing psychiatric or psychological crises whether related to pregnancy or not, this is of course the ongoing responsibility of the statutory services. Counselling is something very private between a doctor and a patient. They do not need all these very learned and trained counsellors. There are neighbours, friends, families and so on who give this advice to the girl about having her baby, keeping her baby, giving it for adoption. I am reading about the psychological service that is available and how we must have specially trained personnel to do this. I am perhaps a little simplistic in my way, but I found some very good people who could advise a girl very well about continuing with her pregnancy, having her baby, helping and providing the support services for her — I seem to have alarmed one Deputy there with what I am saying. I do say that services have been given for a number of years to girls having babies and giving them for adoption etc. Girls have made an informed decision themselves having been given information about all the services that are available. This has been going on for many years. It is not something that will suddenly happen after the legislation comes into effect. One would get the impression from some of the current debate that as soon as this law is passed there will be a sudden rush of women looking for information on abortion. During my years in medical practice I dealt with hundreds of girls who were contemplating abortion. While some may have talked with a clergyman I did not meet one who consulted a psychiatrist. While some, in their emotional turmoil, seriously contemplated disposing [615] of the foetus, but none ever contemplated taking their own lives. Very few such cases are recorded, and indeed the documentation in relation to those is not reliable. I make those points because I get the impression that some people seem to think that once the amendment is agreed to we will be setting up clinics and providing a counselling service on a regional basis for pregnant girls and that suddenly we will have all these girls contemplating abortion.;2627584

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;I would be delighted to do that if the Minister would make an announcement today that the public should also ignore his announced intention in relation to legislation dealing with the question of information because what we are trying to do is to tease out what he is proposing to do with legislation after [617] the amendment to the Constitution is carried. We were provided with information by the Minister in his Second Stage speech as to the kind of restrictions he would place on information once the amendment was carried. What we are trying to do now is to tease out exactly what this means. It is important that people would know, given that they will have to make up their minds on the amendment, what precisely the Government are proposing in this regard. During his speech the other night the Minister said that non-directive counselling means 'setting out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision for herself.' It seems from what the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health have said that it will be in order and legal for some clinics — I instance the CURA Clinic which is anti-abortion and which therefore will not advise on all the options — not to provide information on all the options but only on the options they think are valid for the woman concerned, to the exclusion of abortion. It seems that we have drawn out a number of crucial contradictions as regard what the Government and the Minister are proposing on this question of information. I am concerned about the Minister's statement that the health services will not have a role in the matter of information, because to a significant extent, the people who will be seeking to avail of such information are the people who avail of the public health services. I would like to know precisely what distinction the Minister is making. He is saying that it probably would be better if people received information from their neighbours and friends but it is an unfortunate fact of life that in many cases women have been pressured by friends and relations into having abortions because of what was perceived as the shame attaching to the pregnancy.;2627608

Sometimes it is the man responsible for the pregnancy who puts pressure on the woman to have an abortion. If we are going to leave women in that situation we are doing them a disservice. As the Minister said, we will have to provide non-directive counselling but it will have to be professional counselling, otherwise, as legislators, we would be derelict in our duty towards these women to ensure they make the best choice for themselves, not for their husband, their financee, their mother or their father.;2627612

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Mervyn Taylor;The Labour Party;Like Deputy De Rossa, I have to express grave concern about the indication which has just been given by the Minister for Health that State agencies, the health boards and so on, will be washing their hands of this whole affair and will not be involved in giving information. That is a most remarkable statement because what we are talking about here is an activity that will be legal — the giving of information that people will need. Is the Minister telling the House that he, as a representative of the health agencies of the State, is going to walk away and say that we will leave it to the voluntary agencies to supply the information? If so, this is an indication of the attitude and approach that has been adopted by the Minister and the Government on this issue — they do not want to be involved they want to do the minimum and to let somebody else do the [619] rest. They want this information to be given by everyone, except themselves. Much valuable and important work has been done across a wide field of activity by voluntary agencies. One wonders to what extent such work would be done if these agencies did not exist but there comes a time when the State has to face up to its responsibilities. Given that we have reached the point where we accept that it will be lawful and in order to provide information on abortion services why should the State not accept that, like any other agency it is involved and must make that information available through State institutions? People should be entitled to go to these institutions to get information about their health because that is what the health boards and health agencies are for. It is horrific to think that they would run away from that aspect of their responsibility. I was amazed to hear the Minister indicate that that was what he had in mind in relation to the legislation that is to come. I urge him strongly to rethink that matter. In his comments the Minister for Justice mentioned that advice will be given within the parameters laid down in this amendment. As a person who has always advocated that the detail must be provided for in legislation rather than by way of referendum I support the concept but the purpose of the Labour Party amendment to the Bill is to give the Minister, when he comes to frame the legislation, the widest possible choice because we do not want him to be restrained or constrained by the amendment. However, that is precisely what will happen if he limits the power he is taking to the single word 'information', that is a limitation which he may well find later to be a constraining and limiting factor. When drafting this legislation the Minister may find that his powers are limited. When he gets down to dealing with the nitty gritty of the legislation he may want to extend his powers but will be unable to do so as that would be ultra vires with regard to the wording of this amendment. It is for that reason the Labour Party want to expand the Minister's powers to [620] provide not only information but counselling and assistance for women seeking an abortion. Of course, it would be up to the Minister to decide to what extent he avails of that right. He may limit it in whatever way he wishes, that is the purpose of this legislation. If he accepts the Labour Party amendment, at least, he will have the broadest possible powers in this regard. The Minister may decline to accept our amendment, which proposes to give him those broad powers, only to discover later that he would like to have the power to legislate for more than mere information. The funnelling of people to England, through directive counselling, to have an abortion is not the answer to this problem. However, other types of counselling could be appropriate such as that suggested by Deputy De Rossa. There are various methods of abortion, such as surgical abortion, abortion by means of an abortifacient drug, and so on. A woman seeking an abortion will not know what type of abortion is most suited to her needs or is appropriate for her medical or psychiatric condition. Therefore, it is not sufficient for the adviser — a State or voluntary agency, a doctor or whoever — to simply tell the woman the alternatives and let her decide. She may ask the doctor to advise her on whether she should have her abortion by surgical means, by taking an abortifacient drug or by some other means. As he would have examined her she would expect him to take account of her medical condition and state of mind. If doctors or advisers counsel women as to what they feel would be an appropriate method of abortion for them they would be in breach of this legislation.;2627614

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Mervyn Taylor;The Labour Party;That would be going beyond the giving of information. The Minister should consider that point carefully when drafting the legislation. He should not close that door on himself but rather address the problem in the legislation by leaving all options open. The essential difference between dealing [621] with this matter by way of legislation rather than by consitutional referenda is that more time would be available to address the issues involved. If the Minister closes the door now he may regret it. At some future date, he may regret not including a provision for counselling and assistance when drafting the legislation. The Minister should not put himself in that position. The same applies in regard to assistance. The legislation provides that information on abortion services in other countries may be provided here it leaves it open for a girl or woman to avail of those services. Are we leaving it at that? Is that not a cold-blooded provision? That may be all some people might want, not every one will need counselling or assistance. However, some will need counselling of the types I referred to and others will need assistance, perhaps financial assistance. What will be the position of a person who cannot afford to go to England to avail of the services there? Some voluntary agencies may be willing to provide funding for a girl or woman in that position if it was lawful for them to do so, but under the legislation the giving of financial assistance, in this regard would be illegal. It does not come under the description of 'information' and that is why we propose to insert the word 'assistance' in addition to counselling. That may need further consideration and control under the legislation, but, again, the Minister should consider including some provision in that regard. He should ensure that he has the power to do that if, following consideration, he thinks it appropriate.;2627616

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;In regard to what the Minister for Health said, none of us underestimates the support, advice and solidarity that family and friends could [622] give to a woman faced with an unplanned pregnancy. However, in reality, the last people a woman wishes to find out about her unwanted pregnancy are her family and friends. At times, there is a tendency for a boyfriend or, indeed, families who do not like the stigma attached to an unmarried mother to offer to pay the woman involved to go to England to have an abortion. In rural districts, where there is not the same anonymity as in urban areas, there is sometimes greater pressure on women to have an abortion. Therefore, women in rural areas need to have access to skilled counselling. Dr. Anthony Clare and Dr. J. Tyrell when referring to the circumstances that pertain to Irish women Stated: 'The implications in terms of the provision of appropriate pregnancy counselling and support including the provision of information relating to adoption, abortion and the successful negotiation of a full-term pregnancy would appear obvious'. They were referring to non-directive counselling. The Psychologists for Freedom of Information here wrote to me stating, 'We are of the opinion that proper legislation be enacted to provide for the provision of non-directive pregnancy counselling.' I do not believe we are at cross purposes here but, as Deputy Taylor so eloquently stated, the Minister should not close any doors in this regard. The last thing any of us would wish would be for the Minister to be prevented from doing what he believes is correct because of wording in the legislation that could instigate court cases on its interpretation. We depend very much on voluntary groups and agencies to provide health services, and from a health point of view, this work requires skilled professionals, trained people who must be funded from the health services. That is the plea that we make here. The high risk area of drug users is another area which should be given attention. The Minister for Health has provided clean needles for drug users. Similar measures have been provided in other States, and this constructive health measure has been applauded. We know drug abuse is illegal [623] but the provision of clean needles is necessary for the health of the individual drug user and the community. We would ask the Minister to address the needs of this area in an open and constructive manner in the legislation that is to follow.;2627619

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;The contribution's from Deputies Barnes and Owen are very helpful. We had reached a point in the debate where we were in agreement and introducing other issues at this stage will cause confusion. We are all presupposing that the Amendment to the Constitution will be endorsed and that legislation will be enacted. That legislation will be framed in the manner outlined by the Minister for Health in his summary last night. His summary outlining the proposed legislation was broad, it covered many areas and was well received by Deputies. Some of the interpretations of the language have to be clarified, though they will not appear in the Bill, and this will result in the legislation being acceptable to all Deputies. I am pleased that we have now gone some way towards achieving this end. I will not be responsible for framing the legislation, this will be undertaken by the Minister for Health, but I will, le cúnamh Dé, be at the table and I will make my contribution as well. It is interesting to hear the Deputies' views on how we should proceed in this matter in so far as providing all the options and information that is necessary so that people can make an informed and correct decision. We are all nearing agreement in this regard. I would like to respond to a point made by Deputy Taylor in regard to his view that the word 'information' may be too restrictive. I referred to this matter before Deputy Taylor came into the Chamber as it had already been raised by Deputy Owen. I have already told the House that the Government's purpose was to provide for non-directive counselling, but my legal advice in regard to non-directive counselling is that the word 'information' in the Bill is sufficient, without any reference to counselling to [624] achieve that purpose. In other words, it is catered for in the legislation and it is clearly understood that the Amendment as it is now framed can stand and it adequately incorporates the matters raised by Deputy Barnes. We are not restricted in that way. The word 'information' is broad enough to cater for non-directive counselling and that view is also endorsed by Deputy O'Connell. Where and when such non-directive counselling may be provided can be considered when the legislation is before the House. I am sure the legislation will be very broad and voluminous to incorporate all the matters that have been referred to by the individual Deputies, and that is the way we will be proceeding.;2627620

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Deputy Barnes is quite right there. Any legislation that we might [625] contemplate cannot be guaranteed either. The amendment to the Bill proposed by Deputy De Rossa and his colleagues protects the freedom to obtain or make available in this State information about services lawfully available in anothere state. It does not attempt to specify the types of services beyond requiring that they should be lawfully available in another state. It would be pointless, in fact it would be impossible, to attempt to itemise all the various services which are lawfully available in other states and which, accordingly, would become within the scope of the amendment proposed to the Bill. There is no need to carry out such an exercise and I do not believe it would be practical. The Bill does not mention the word 'abortion' although information about that service service was clearly in mind when the amendment proposed to the Bill was first mooted, in line with the commitment that was entered into with all the party Leaders. That was clearly understood at the time and is being honoured in this amendment. Deputy De Rossa's amendment is opposed. The Bill provides for information about services lawfully available in other states in line with ten commitment entered into by party Leaders and I am not prepared and do not see any real need to depart from that wording. In those circumstances, of course, the amendment is opposed. There is a genuine and general acceptance of what we are seeking to achieve here and this is a good way to achieve it. Hopefully the legislation will receive unanimous support.;2627627

I put it down to try to tease out precisely what services were being provided. As the Minister stated, the clear intention is to provide for information and presumably counselling for abortion services. That is not specifically stated in the constitutional amendment that has been proposed. Just as we had this debate in relation to travel, that amendment does [626] not refer to the travel rights being proposed specifically for abortion. I do not propose to go into the extraordinary double-think in regard to people who, on the one hand, are opposed to abortion and on the other, say 'Yes' to the right of people to travel to Britain for an abortion, and that we will provide information services and so on. I am sure we will have that debate again next week. If the Minister is giving me a categoric assurance that what could, in shorthand, be described as pharmacological abortion, would not be excluded in the advice, counselling or information that will be provided under this amendment or under the legislation that is being proposed, then I would be satisfied to withdraw the amendment.;2627628

The Minister for Health said that non-directive counselling means — and this is his definition — setting out all the available options in order to let the woman make an informed decision herself. Will it then be necessary for any organisations, voluntary or public, to make information available on all the options? If organisations are obliged to do so will Cura, for example, a Roman Catholic organisation who are, in principle, against abortion, be obliged to provide information on abortion?;2627630

Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee Stage (Resume;22.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;The position will be similar to that under all legislation that provides for a service. Some organisations may decide to proceed differently from others, and obviously organisations will not be mandated to proceed in a certain way. The legislation will be wide enough to cover all organisations regardless of which option they take. We are not involved in the dictating business. The freedom available to organisations will be covered in the legislation and can be teased out when the legislation is before the House. I do not think the Deputy would suggest that in advance of the legislation we set down proposals as to who will be dictated to, what they will do and how they will do it. That is not what this amendment is about and it would be wrong for us to get into that area of conversation, even today. We are purely considering the amendment of the Constitution as it relates to information. However, the Deputy should feel free to raise that matter again, as I am sure he will, when the legislation is before the House. It is not my intention to give a direction as to what Cura or any other organisation will or will not do. The legislation will be framed in such a way that the information we are talking about will be there, and any organisation who wishes to avail of the legislative frame work may do so.

It is my contention that the current problems facing the Government in relation to abortion derive directly from the appalling sectarian amendment which was incorporated in our constitution in 1983. There is no point in rehashing the debate that took place in [764] 1983, but it was categorically stated at the time by those promoting the Eight Amendment that it was not intended to change anything, that it was simply intended to maintain the status quo. It was stated that it would not interfere with the protection of the life or the health of women, their right to travel or the right to information. Those of us who opposed the amendment forewarned on all of these issues. It was equally claimed that all it was intended to do was to ensure that the 1861 Act could not be struck down by legislation in this Parliament. We now know of course that that has not been the case, that quite a lot has been changed since the passing of the Eight Amendment of the Constitution. We know that students have been hounded by the courts and charged as a result of complaints that they were distributing abortion information and the courts have banned such information. We know also that books on health have been removed from our library shelves——;2628000

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Seán Treacy;The Labour Party;The Deputy seems to be embarking on a Second Reading speech which is inappropriate on Committee Stage of the Bill. His amendment has been ruled out of order for obvious reasons, that it is in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time. Perhaps the Deputy's speech should be reserved for the Schedule where most of the amendments appear. There is nothing much in section 1 and, therefore, I expect Members to be brief in regard to it and to reserve their main comments for the amendments to the Schedule. Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 all relate to the Schedule it is not for the Chair to advise Members how to utilise their time but I respectfully submit to them that the least delay should occur on sections 1 and 2 of the Bill and that we should proceed, as quickly as possible, to deal with the amendments to the Schedule. Proinsias de Rossa: A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for your contribution. I am speaking to section 1 which provides [765] for the amendment of Article 40. 3.3º. of the Constitution. I was making the point that we would not be in the current situation if we had not amended the Constitution the way we did in 1983 and left the Dáil free to legislate in whatever way it saw fit, given the public support — or otherwise — of abortion in limited circumstances. I disagree fundamently with what is proposed in section 1.;2628001

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;I am explaining why I oppose section 1. I intend to call a vote on it because I disagree fundamentally with the concept that we can solve our abortion problem by simply amending Article 40. 3.3º. That is the purpose of my comments I was making the point that it was alleged the amendment would change nothing and that, in fact, it has changed quite a considerable amount in relation to information regarding the stocking of books on women's health on our library shelves and on the circulation of internationally renowned newspapers like The Manchester Guardian, which we know was prevented from being distributed in this State because it carried an advertisement on information regarding abortion clinics in Britain. All these things are a direct result of the 1983 amendment and we should not simply pass over section 1 because it seeks to further amend Article 40. 3.3º in a way — as we will see when we come to the amendments to the Schedule — which will simply provide for abortion in extremely limited circumstances and will not address the problems which this State faces. That is the very stark problem, at least 5,000 Irish women have gone to Britain for abortions in the past year. It would be a mistake for the House to simply agree section 1 when it approaches the problem in a totally inadequate way. I argued on Second Stage, and otherwise both inside and outside this House — that it is time this House took its courage in its hands and faced the reality that Ireland has a problem in relation to abortion which we cannot ignore by pretending [766] it does not exist. We must put services in place for women who find themselves in that position and provide for circumstances in which someone can legitimately obtain an abortion in this State.;2628003

1324;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;My remarks are addressed to the Minister for Justice. In his contribution on Second Stage he stated that the Government were not persuaded of the need for supplementary legislation — supplementary to the proposed constitutional amendment — but that they would listen carefully to any views expressed on this matter during the course of the debate. The Minister, in his reply to the debate, did not address that question. In my contribution, I identified a number of reasons for bringing legislation forward among these was the difficulty in attempting the encompass a matter as complicated as this in 55 words [767] in a Constitution because, no matter how well drafted and chosen the words, they are inherently open to doubt and debate as to their precise meaning. In seeking to deal with the matter solely through the Constitution we are, essentially, handing over what would otherwise be a legislative role to the courts in so far as the main decision making process in the area will be through judicial interpretation rather than through legislation. That is not a good way to make law in any country, particularly in one which prides itself on being a parliamentary democracy. I said I accepted that a matter of this nature — being one of life and death — was something which should be properly dealt with in the Constitution. I accepted that it should be dealt with in the Constitution and that an amendment to the existing Article is justified because of the decision of the Supreme Court which would appear to allow suicide as a general ground for abortion. I said that needed to be changed — and can only be changed — by constitutional amendment. Having said I accepted that, I went on to argue that if we intend to deal with the matter in the Constitution we should also deal with it by legislation, to avoid doubt. I outlined in my contribution, to which the Minister did not advert in his concluding remarks, many difficulties which might arise in defining, for example, the meaning of the term 'life' as distinct from 'health' in practical medical situations, for example, where the threat to life is not immediate but is real just the same. There is bound to be a situation in which one medical person could argue that it is just a threat to health and another could argue that it is a threat to life. As we know, medicine is not an exact science, if it was we would not see medical people being called quite frequently on opposite sides of court cases, some to argue that the matter is very serious and others to argue that it is less serious. Indeed, some people make almost a profession of appearing as expert witnesses on opposite sides of cases concerning medical issues. Quite clearly there are areas in which the guidance [768] of the Legislature would be extremely helpful in setting out in detail the parameters we intend or the way the terms used in the Constitution are to be interpreted. The Minister was not present in the House when I spoke, for reasons I am not going to question, and so far as I am aware he did not reply to this aspect. It seems to me that the House has a clear obligation to set out in detail the way in which we expect this provision to be applied in practice. Otherwise, people will vote on a subject about which there is a great deal of confusion. The public will hear people making categoric assertions as to the meaning of the terms of the Constitution which directly contradict one another and confusion will be the result. One group of doctors will say that the wording has one meaning and another set of doctors will say that it has another meaning one set of lawyers will say that the wording has one meaning and another set of apparently equally eminent lawyers will say the opposite one set of politicians will say that the wording has one meaning and another set of politicians will say that it has another meaning — but that would not cause any great surprise. People will be surprised, though, to hear so many eminent lawyers and medical people in direct contradiction with one another. It is my belief that as a result of the contradictions and confusion the cause that the Minister is seeking to serve will not be served. It is very unfair to the public that there should be a debate in which people are hotly contradicting one another without anyone being in a position to arbitrate as to who is right and who is wrong, that there is debate on an issue on which the public are left to make the decision in the midst of a storm of contradiction across the airwaves. That is another reason for my feeling that the Minister would have been well advised to introduce first legislation that would accompany any constitutional amendment he was proposing. Such legislation would have been able to go in sufficient detail into the kind of circumstances that might arise. For example, for certain heart conditions [769] doctors will now have to decide whether a termination of pregnancy is necessary to save a woman'a life. It is clearly important that guidelines be set down but that cannot be done by way of constitutional amendment because the Constitution is too short and terse a document for that. A guideline should be set out for doctors on the way in which that decision should be made and such guidelines can be set out only in legislation. I am surprised that for that reason the Minister has not decided to introduce legislation. Perhaps in replying to this contribution he will indicate some change of mind. The Minister needs also to address in legislation the issue of legal liability for certain decisions. For example, a doctor might decide that a woman needs chemotherapy during the first three months of a pregnancy but some medical evidence might suggest that such treatment could lead to very severe damage to the child in the womb though the child would be born alive. Being born alive, the child would obviously have to be cared for and the cost of care and the burdens that would have to be borne financially as well as in every other way would be great. Under such circumstances one could forsee civil court cases being taken under which one party, suing on behalf of the child, would sue either the mother's doctor or the mother herself on the grounds that if the doctor or the mother were insured, damages could be obtained, the proceeds of which would be used to support the child. It would appear to me that such a civil case would not be decided on traditional grounds of long-established legal interpretations in relation to torts in general, damages and so forth, but would be decided on the basis of this provision of the Constitution, on the basis of whether the doctor made a decision which was justified on the grounds that he or she was dealing with a life-threatening condition.;2628010

I feel that much of what is being said would be more appropriate when dealing with amendments later. Seemingly, Members feel that they may now embark on Second Reading speeches on section 1, which is a very limited section, as is section 2. Little or no regard is being had to the amendments proper, tabled by various Members and various parties of the House, on the Schedule. I am concerned that the Committee proceed to deal with this constitutional measure in proper order. For that reason, I ask Members to have regard to what is contained in section 1.

Would the Minister not agree that legislation would be helpful in dealing with the aspect I have outlined? There is a final point I should like the Minister to deal with in relation to the question of whether he will have legislation to accompany the amendment. I speak of a possible challenge in the European Court of Human Rights to this or any other amendment. It is my understanding that the European Court of Human Rights would be much less likely to upset a provision on an issue of this kind if it were set out in fairly robust and detailed legislation and would be much more likely to upset any decision we might make if we confined ourselves solely to 55 words in the Constitution. It seems that the more detailed are the procedures, the more liabilities are set out and the more exceptions are provided for, the less likely it is that the European Court of Human Rights would upset the decision. The more abbreviated and terse the provision, the more likely it is that the decision would be upset. The last thing anyone in the House would want would be to labour long and hard to put in place a legal position only to discover that it was upset subsequently elsewhere. It would seem to me that all sides of the House would recognise that factor as justifying legislation. Therefore, I have to ask the Minister for Justice whether he has not considered that argument as a justification for providing legislation first or to accompany this amendment. I hope the Minister will reply to the points I have raised.;2628018

In fact, the views expressed in 1983 by Deputies Flynn and Woods, in particular, arguing for the insertion of Article 40. 3.3º highlight the uncertainty of this issue. The Minister should take the opportunity to address his reasons for not bringing forward legislation to give effect to our responsibilities as legislators. In 1983 Members gave their strong views which have turned out to be totally wrong and the courts have established their incorrectness. It is time for people to acknowledge that and admit we are embarking on a course of action that will more than likely end in a bigger mess than the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. In that respect I say to the Minister that legislation would go someway towards reducing the uncertainties that now confront us. The obligations on the House have been well detailed. This is an extremely complex issue, one described as being so complex by a moral theologian recently as to almost defy summary. I accept that view. It defies summary in a constitutional amendment if we are serious about trying to provide a solution to the difficult and complex problems confronting us. The judgement of the late Mr. Justice McCarthy, which has been mentioned in this House, should be the guiding judgment to us as we undertake our responsibilities. There are many areas of conflict and uncertainty between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health in their public comments on this issue. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, gave a different version in the Dáil than had been given a matter of days previously by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health. Perhaps on this Stage we will get clarification of some of those uncertainties. I would say to the Minister for Health that section 1 is leading us down a path which, unfortunately, we were led down in 1983, and those Ministers played a major part in that campaign. All the opinions and certainties expressed with conviction by the present Minister for [773] Justice in 1983 have been proven to be totally incorrect. We should acknowledge that before it is too late. I worry that by accepting section 1, and pursuing this course of action by constitutional amendment, we are creating a problem rather than solving one.;2628022

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;This section, in effect, allows us to insert additional words in the Constitution which are contained in the Schedule. I do not want to delay the House by repeating what Deputies Bruton and Spring said but it is clear from the Schedule and this section, and from what the Minister has said to the House so far, that in addressing this issue the Government's sole intent is to provide for the insertion of an amendment into the Constitution. Section 1 deals with the authority to go ahead and amend the Constitution. From this side of the House has come the message that there is a need for legislation and not simply a need for a constitutional amendment. It would be remiss of us today if we did not remind the Minister that the need for legislation has also been acknowledged by Government colleagues. It is noteworthy in this context that when the Minister gave his response to the Second Stage debate on the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bills on 21 October 1992 for some reason that I find difficult to understand, he omitted to either refer to or respond to the comments made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I do not want to go into those comments in any great detail but I want to refer to comments made by the Minister who is part of this Government as to the need for legislation, comments which confirm the views expressed by Deputies Bruton and Spring. In dealing with the mere insertion of additional words into the Constitution the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said something that all of us know to be the case but which the Minister seems to have great difficulty in acknowledging. He said: There are plenty of lessons to be [774] learned from the X case. One is that the only interpretation of words in the Constitution that counts is the view formed by the Supreme Court. Ministers, Deputies, doctors, clerics and lawyers can in all good faith give their view of what certain words mean, but their interpretation has no standing whatever. The need for legislation is based on the fact that you cannot fully and properly address this issue by simply amending the Constitution. A simple amendment to the Constitution, in a sense, is an abdication of legislative responsibility because we are then leaving it to members of the Supreme Court, in a particular case or cases, to tell us what those words mean. Indeed, if any lesson should have been learned from 1983 it is that any Member of this House who stands up here and asserts, in absolute terms, what words we are proposing to insert in the Constitution mean does so at his or her peril. If we are engaging in a true dialogue in this House — and not a dialogue of the deaf — the debate last week should have brought that home. We are not engaged in trying to score political points but rather in trying to address a serious and difficult issue and, indeed, one that is greatly confusing many people outside this House. There have been so many disparate interpretations of the Minister's proposal that section 1 would provide for being included in the Constitution from all sides, including his own, that that of itself should ring the alarm bells. I do not wish to make a political point out of this but it is a reality that Members on the Government side of the House, even within the Fianna Fáil Party, have expressed a degree of confusion as to what the words mean. Apparently, the Minister's speech last Tuesday was such a wonderful presentation that all of a sudden all the fog cleared at the end of it. Clearly, the fog did not clear in the minds of his other colleagues in Government. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, again making the case for legislation, said: [775] Surely the most fundamental lesson to be learned from the X case is that hard-case exceptions do occur. Surely this should cause us to pause and ponder the wisdom of our actions in trying to reduce the whole complex question of the balance of rights between a pregnant woman and her unborn to a single constitutional statement. Why on earth can we not consider this as a serious problem? Why is it that apparently anything said from this side of the House in this area is to be disregarded? It is all part of a political game of macho politics between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats who can look the longest into the other's eyeballs and who will blink first. Is that what the game is about? Are we truly trying to address something of great seriousness? It is very curious that the Minister refused and failed entirely to respond to what Deputy O'Malley said. Even if the amendment was passed in its current form the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley said: No matter what the people of Ireland decide in December regarding the Twelfth Amendment on the so-called substantive issue, the Progressive Democrats believe that legislation will be essential to guide doctors in dealing with the real life cases that simply will not readily comply with the formal constitutional text now proposed. I said something similar here the day before Deputy O'Malley's speech. Presumably, Deputy O'Malley was making this case within Cabinet and within Government. Why is it that the Minister will not address that issue? It would be reasonable in the context of section 1, which authorises a new provision to be inserted into the Constitution, for the Minister to acknowledge that legislation is needed and to acknowledge what the Fine Gael Party are saying, that legislation should be brought before [776] the House and at least published prior to a referendum being held. The fact that there are, in a state of confusion, so many groups on different sides of the debate, many well-meaning people outside this House with similar concerns to ours, who have no particular axe to grind should be sufficient for the Minister to realise the need for legislation in regard to the Amendment. Deputy O'Malley went on to make other points which are more appropriate to the formal amendments to the Schedule and I intend to deal with them at that stage.;2628026

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;Let no one say this is not a real problem because as recently as 28 September 1992 the story of the late wife of one Brendan Hodges appeared in The Irish Times detailing how during her period of pregnancy she suffered a reactive tumour in her back, having previously suffered cancer, and how medical treatment was delayed until it was too late. This woman lost her life and the life of her baby was lost also. That is a real example of a situation that can arise where medical doctors are confused as to whether they should intervene because of provisions in our Constitution. I understand that case is heading towards the courts but no one has objected to the article in The Irish Times. Our case is that we cannot be absolutist about this. When the Minister gives assurances in the absolutist manner in [870] which he has done this evening, he is replicating what happened in 1983. What we can properly and validly say is that this wording is open to disparate interpretations which can give rise to confusion. The distinction in relation to health as contained in this could result in treatments which women require more quickly being delayed it could result in debates within the medical profession that are not concerned with saving the life of a woman but rather with whether doctors will be subject to court injunctions or constitutional actions.;2628029

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pat McCartan;The Workers' Party;I will deal briefly with [873] some of the reasons I believe this House should support the amendments tabled by Democratic Left in respect of a proposal to substitute a better formula of words to those put forward by the Minister, not just in respect of the difference between the life and health of women, but in regard to a number of other important aspects. Throughout this debate the Minister has constantly sought to dismiss Deputy De Rossa and me, and indeed my other colleagues in Democratic Left, with a shake of the hand by suggesting that we propose a case for abortion on demand in Ireland. I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to deal with that briefly. The manner in which the Minister sought to dismiss the proposals made by Deputy De Rossa in advancing his amendment was insulting in the extreme. The note I took of what the Minister said was that because, as a party, we propose that abortion should be available in the State to assist women faced with a real and substantial risk to their health as well as their life, we are, therefore, arguing for abortion on demand. He then used the cliché — and I do not understand why he continues to use it — that the Government and himself are not in the business of introducing abortion, that their amendment is a pro-life amendment. I am pro-life I am the father of children but I am also pro-abortion to the extent that I recognise there are circumstances in which abortion is necessary to assist women to guard against threats, real and substantial, to their life as well as their health. It is regrettable that the Government, with the wave of the hand and the use of abusive language, continue to dismiss those who in some way wish to address this debate, because they believe we support abortion on demand. My understanding of the words 'abortion on demand' is that regimes somewhere in the world provide for the absolute right of a woman to present herself at a clinic up to a certain stage of pregnancy, to be given, without let or hindrance, an abortion as a means to terminate a pregnancy or as a method of birth control. [874] That is what I understand abortion on demand to mean. No one in this House, and indeed no one in the wider debate outside this House as I understand it, has yet sought to make that case and neither Democratic Left nor I are making that case as a medical or other proposition. In a document which we published during this debate — to which, regrettably, the Minister paid no regard or took no time to consider — we proposed that in certain specific circumstances set out in that document a woman should have the right to opt for termination of her pregnancy. Those circumstances include a case where the life or the health of a woman are threatened with a real and substantial risk, where the woman is subjected to rape or incest or where the medical advice and opinion is that the foetus has no hope of survival beyond delivery. In those circumstances, within a certain period of time, we proposed that a woman should have the right to opt, on medical advice, for a termination of her pregnancy. We set out a broad range of circumstances into which that regime should fit which included proper counselling and support before and after the termination. We suggested a proposition, which has the support at least of one Minister, because he made a similar proposition on our national airwaves, that there is a contradiction in insisting in those circumstances that abortions which take place in another jurisdiction should end and that we should provide for them at home. Although the Minister has a much narrower definition of the meaning of abortion on demand, he must accept that it exists as a fact of life for many thousands of Irish women today. It has been estimated conservatively that more than 5,000 Irish women each year travel to England with a view to ending their pregnancies. Because he maintains it never happens here but can be facilitated by the right to travel and right to information on such services in a jurisdiction, in some instances no more than 60 or 80 miles away, is the Minister suggesting he is dealing with this issue in a morally correct manner? [875] In a document the Taoiseach circulated to party leaders as representing the basic briefing material from the Attorney General to the Cabinet and upon which the Minister and the Government were making the decision with regard to the legislation, it is stated on page 3: Some doctors are of the view that it is possible to treat these conditions without resorting to direct abortion. However, it seems difficult to advance, a categorical statement that circumstances could never arise which would require a direct abortion to save the mother's life. Acting on that advice, that there can never be an absolute proposition advanced that rules out direct abortion in all circumstances, the Government should proceed and they have proceeded. It is also regrettable that the Minister had absolutely no regard for the acknowledgment I recognised in the Government's proposals, limited though they were, that they squarely address the preposterous argument advanced by the pro-life group that there is an absolute formula of words that can be written into the Constitution ruling our forever the proposition of abortion being provided for in Irish law and medical practice. I acknowledge the Minister had at least taken that ridiculous proposition squarely on board and said categorically that it cannot be adhered to and that the Government were providing, although in restricted circumstances, for abortion in certain circumstances in this State. Yet, the Minister has said that his amendment does not provide for abortion, it is pro-life. Why are we engaging in such dishonesty even at this stage? We have had a reasonable debate on Second Stage and sometimes on Committee Stage. Therefore, why are we reducing this debate to the level of hurling insults across the floor? The Minister's amendment makes proposals for abortion although he may want to call it something else. I am not worried if he wants to call it termination of pregnancy that is his right and I do not wish [876] to deny him that right. However, when someone stands up here and uses the word 'abortion' it is not a basis upon which the Minister should dismiss us as if we were making some unreal proposition which has not been made in this debate. The Minister must listen to the arguments put forward. Fine Gael have serious reservations on the distinction between life and health. The Government only want to talk about the right to life, which I accept, but it must be the right to a healthy life. It is no good the Government saying that they will allow women to survive without regard to their condition? Is there to be no regard by our medical profession, our Government and our legislators to the condition in which women will be left after they deliver their child? For instance a woman said on radio only last week that the advice she received was that the inevitable consequence of the delivery of her child to full term would have been incontinence for the rest of her life. Is such a woman to be denied the opportunity and choice to say, 'if I want to be a healthy, living woman to care for the other children in my family, I cannot cope with that condition and, therefore, should have the right to consider, in consultation with my medical advisers, a termination of the pregnancy'? What of the position of the Mrs. Hodgers of this world? Is it a proposition that they are to be helped to the point of delivery, and to survive for only two days after the birth? Can anyone explain to me, either by reference to the previous law which the Government say they are abiding by in this amendment or, indeed, in consequence of what is now before us, what the position of that woman or any woman will be should they have to go through that unbelievable experience, where the husband could stand at the front door of the hospital and hear his wife scream in pain four floors above? What medical practice, what proposition in law or what succour under the Minister's proposal is to be given to a woman in similar unfortunate circumstances? We in Democratic Left have reservations [877] that have been spelled out in the amendment. A paper prepared by Dr. Anthony Clare, one of the most eminent psychiatrists in this country, concluded — and I quote from the document he prepared: 'The relevant literature is reviewed which shows that suicide is an occasional outcome of refused abortion and has fallen in those jurisdictions which permit abortion on psychiatric grounds'. To my mind it is utterly inconsistent for people, particularly the Minister for Health, to argue that suicide, which is a clearly identifiable medical condition, cannot be considered as a proper ground for abortions on medical supervision or advice. I utterly reject the Minister's view that it is not scientifically possible to evaluate or establish suicide as a phenomenon. That flies in the face of all medical advice and beliefs as I understand it. It is an incredible statement by the Minister and represents a total shift of ground on his part of this debate because up to now the Minister had argued that if suicide was allowed as an option — following on the partial reliance on the David Owenses of this world — it would represent 'abortion on demand'. That was the only argument and proposition put forward by the Minister as to why the issue of suicide could not be considered. The Minister, in this preposterous statement, suggests that suicide is scientifically unquantifiable. That proposition must be totally rejected. I am grateful for the opportunity to make this brief contribution in support of the amendment proposed by Deputy De Rossa and other Deputies in Democratic Left. I believe the Government could have done much better. We have put forward a number of alternative proposals and if the Government ever seriously considered achieving consensus on this issue, they should have adopted the amendment to remove the ridiculous proposition which makes a distinction between the life and the health of the woman. That in itself would have gone some way to meet the reservations on all sides of this House. I do not believe that the Minister, the Taoiseach or anyone on the opposite side of the House had ever [878] any interest in achieving consensus on this issue. Acting Chairman: I now call on Deputy Fennell and I will then call on the Minister to reply.;2628032

The Progressive Democrats are within that majority. It is curious that their views are not deemed worthy of any serious consideration. We are used to Fianna Fáil members in Government ignoring what the Opposition parties say, but one would expect that they would at least take half seriously what their colleagues in Government say. I realise that the position of the Progressive Democrats is anomalous, the aim of the Fianna Fáil Party is to shove the Progressive Democrats out of Government on this issue. That is not what this debate should be about and it is regrettable that it has reached that stage. I hope that during the afternoon some member of the Progressive Democrats will be in the House to express their views on the Committee Stage of this Bill. When that party were about to be formed, Deputy O'Malley made a very impressive speech describing how he was standing by the Republic. However, it appears that on this issue and on a number of other issues the Progressive Democrats, rather than standing by the Republic, are bystanders in the [777] Republic. There is a serious issue in relation to this Bill which the Minister is not addressing. That issue is relevant to section 1 and the Schedules and we deserve a more detailed response than the Government have yet given.;2628035
1350;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pat McCartan;The Workers' Party;I support the proposition made by Deputy De Rossa that section I, as proposed, should not stand part of the Bill. It is the motor of the vehicle which the Government propose to put before the people on 3 December, the proposition they are maintaining, that the complex issue of the availability or, indeed, non-availability of abortion in Ireland or for Irish women abroad can be dealt with by way of an amendment to the Constitution and by no other device. For that reason the proposition that section 1 should stand part of the Bill should not be supported. In essence, the section and the wording proposed by the Minister is built on a proposition that was inserted into the Constitution in 1983, a proposition which, in itself, was wrong in principle and was as unnecessary and as divisive then as it is today. It is wrong to ask us to legislate in relation to such a proposition. The Government's approach to this issue has singularly destroyed whatever basis or potential for consensus there may have been both inside and outside this House and which could have been built on and acted on. It is time we appreciated and admitted that, while there are differing degrees of opposition to abortion as a general right and facility here, it is necessary in certain circumstances. That principle has been accepted on all sides of the House. In proposing this legislation, the Minister admitted that there are restricted circumstances in which abortion must be made available in our jurisdiction. That arises out of the X case which illustrated that there cannot be written into any Constitution words that would absolutely guarantee against anything happening in the future — that we cannot legislate out of existence the Supreme Court, their function and role as interpreters not only of our laws but of the Constitution itself and say that, as [778] times change, views there will also change. The 1983 amendment was put before us on the basis that it was an absolute set of words that would guard against, first, the Supreme Court even providing an alternative opinion or, secondly, the Legislature having to act in regard to providing for abortion in Ireland in some circumstances. Those events have now occurred and we are making a grave mistake by not recognising that there are no absolutes in this world, that there is no formula of words available to anyone, including the so-called pro-life lobby, that will provide a solution from their point of view. Mr. Justice McCarthy correctly chastised the Oireachtas for not providing legislation based on the 1983 referendum. While the Minister has produced a formula of words under section 1 of the Bill, there will be a need for legislation one way or the other after this legislation is passed. I urge the Minister to again reflect on the Government's approach to this matter and to take note genuinely of our reservations and concerns. Even if we proceed with the wording as it is the Government should at least undertake to examine the position in the light of the legislation as passed and bring forward legislation that will put some meat on it. The amendment is not sufficient in itself. For those reasons and because the Government have not indicated a willingness to address the need for legislation, intending instead, to stick squarely and stubbornly to the amendment, we believe that the section should not be supported by the House.;2628036

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;Listening to this debate one is astounded at the apparent assumption of a lack of logic and of dignity on the part of the electorate. In regard to the amendment which many people had grave doubts about in 1983, suffice it to quote a politician who said recently in another Parliament and about another matter, 'the sky was darkened with the chickens coming home to roost'. The sky has been darkened by the interpretation of the Supreme Court in regard to the Eight Amendment of the Constitution and that interpretation is of concern to anybody who worked either for or against that amendment in 1983. The most logical extension of our experience, particularly through the X case, a lesson learned through painful embarrassment, was that words cannot be inserted into a Constitution to cover such a complex and life-threatening issue. It is not possible. Other countries through changes in their Constitutions have learned this lesson painfully as well. The late Mr. Justice McCarthy spelled it out, not in a mild way for us as legislators, but by way of criticism that we had not legislated to back up that amendment. The 1983 amendment failed on every level, now we are trying to put a patch on a faulty amendment, but the patch will only add to the confusion and to the life-threatening aspects of this amendment if it is put before a confused electorate and voted upon. I would remind the Minister even at this stage, that this is a Republic and a State we can be proud of and it represents democracy. Democracy must start with the leadership by legislators the voters have entrusted to give leadership and legislative guidelines. That is the principal reason we were voted into this House, and I would like all Members to remember that. What has happened? We have been debating a wording to which every party in this House, including the Progressive Democrats but excluding Fianna Fáil, objected. We have requested that legislation be introduced so that we [780] would not put to the electorate a wording that would not only lead to confusion but might lead women and men to believe the issue had not been clarified and that they did not have the right to vote on this issue because the legislators had let them down. We have not spelled out the implications of this wording and it will take only a few years, rather than the nine years the other amendment took, for this amendment to be appealed to our courts and to the European courts. Once again we will receive world media attention, we will be shamed and embarrassed and people will wonder how this could have happened. We never intended this amendment to have these incredible implications. Surely we should have learned our lesson. It is important for us to say in fairness that in 1983 many people, out of a real concern, voted in the belief that they were voting on a serious moral issue over which they could have some control.;2628040

The majority of voters will not be clear on this issue. In order to assert ourselves as legislators and to do what is expected of us in this Chamber and in the Seanad, it is wrong for us to consider putting the wording and the Schedule as they now stand to the people. Daily the Minister must meet people who tell him they are concerned and confused. Half of the electorate are wondering not only if their health but if their lives, too, is in the balance. This amendment is anti-democratic, it is anti-life and it is certainly anti-women. I wish the Minister would respond seriously to that.;2628042

The Chair is advising Members of the need to dispose of sections 1 and 2 and then the amendments proper. I had indicated to Deputy Nuala Fennell earlier, I now call Deputy Fennell.;2628043
1358;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;F;Ms. Nuala Fennell;Fine Gael;I wish to speak briefly on this section. The reason we did not have division on section 1 in the other Bills was that people agreed with the need to have a referendum on travel and on information. They were quite specific on that. I believe there is general support among the electorate for what we are doing in that regard. However, this is an entirely different issue. I wholeheartedly oppose what we are doing in this Bill. What we are doing is, I believe, dangerous and wrong. In all the Second Stage speeches last week, we had a catalogue of women's problems. The Minister for Health referred to cardiac failure, renal failure, hyper-tension, brain tumour, breast cancer, cancer of the uterus, and I could go on if I had a medical directory or encyclopaedia with me. We are talking about all these issues in the context of the need for an abortion, a need for us to develop new thinking, having challenged our own thinking on the issue of abortion. However, we are trying to put cement into our Constitution, yet one more concept which will make it more difficult for people to understand what they are doing, it will make it more difficult for doctors to understand their rights and the rules govening their particular procedures. We are dealing with an issue which involves a risk to the life and health of women. We are not talking about introducing social abortion, abortion on demand. We are dealing with a crucial issue. We have had the play and the replay of all the problems that can confront a woman which can make it necessary, even essential, that termination of a pregnancy is considered. The Constitution is the wrong place to insert such provisions. If we have a referendum on a simple issue — say, do you want PR? [782]— people can vote yes or no. However, nobody knows what will happen in regard to this issue. I appeal that we turn back, suspend this Bill and bring forward legislation. I have a cutting of the Irish Independent of 22 October which has the heading: 'Taoiseach offers tough choice to pro-life lobby'. Obviously, the Taoiseach has spelt out somewhere the type of legislation he would introduce. I see this as nothing but blackmail and a threat, but if the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice have this in mind — and obviously he has a framework he wants to introduce — it should be before this House now. We should know what we are talking about. I strongly object to the fact that elected representatives are being treated like school children. If legislation is likely to be introduced — I suggest that it is likely because I can see this amendment being defeated — the Minister owes it to us to say what type of legislation he has in mind and when it will be available.;2628044

On many occasions constitutional interpretation is a bit like literary criticism and it is possible for legal practitioners to assess the same quantum of information and come to different conclusions. I remember on occasion reading essays on literary criticisms where one group of students could prove that Hamlet was mad and another group could prove he was sane, while relying on the same text. I have no doubt that barristers who are uniquely suited by their profession and training to argue diametrically opposed positions down to finality——;2628046

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East):——based on exactly the same information would have no difficulty in interpreting any constitutional amendment in [783] different ways. We must remember that judges are barristers by profession in the first instance. The Minister is being negligent in not looking at the decisions arrived at by judges in the past and what they said when they arrived at those judgments. I would refer him again to what Judge Walsh said in the McGee case during the middle seventies. He said that judges had an obligation to interpret the Constitution in accordance with the Preamble and, in particular, in line with the virtues of justice, prudence and charity, which are referred to in the Preamble. I should like to quote what Judge Walsh said: The judges, must, therefore, as best they can from their training and their experience interpret these rights in accordance with their ideas of prudence, justice and charity. It is but natural that from time to time the prevailing ideas of these virtues may be conditioned by the passage of time no interpretation of the Constitution is intended to be final for all time. It is given in the light of prevailing ideas and concepts. That judgment was given in 1975. In 1976 in the State v. O'Donoghue, Chief Justice Tom O'Higgins echoed the same point. He said: In my view, this Preamble makes it clear that rights given by the Constitution must be considered in accordance with concepts of prudence, justice and charity, which may gradually change or develop as society changes and develops, and which fall to be interpreted from time to time in accordance with prevailing ideas. The Preamble envisages a Constitution which can absorb or be adapted to such changes. In other words, the Constitution did not seek to impose for all time the ideas prevalent or accepted with regard to these virtues at the time of its enactment. It absolutely follows that the Constitution is not going to be interpreted at the time of amendment purely by reference to the [784] ideals which prevailed at the time of the amendment, if we could even come to a consensus on what those ideals are. I suggest to the Minister that the judgments I have quoted are very significant. Mr. Justice Finlay quoted these sections with approval in the X case and said he was, in effect, continuing with that school of interpretation of the Constitution when he was arriving at his conclusions. He decided it was prudent, just and charitable to lift the injunction on the girl in the X case so that she could travel. Quite clearly, the more words that are included by way of amendment the greater the scope there is for a variance in constitutional interpretation. I suggest to the Minister that far more words are being included here than are necessary to exclude the suicide exception, if that is his intention. One of the merits of the constitutional cases on Article 40. 3.3º is that at least we now know what it means in so far as the Supreme Court is concerned. It seems to me that if the Minister was going down the constitutional road solely he should have preserved intact what had been adjudicated and simply dealt with the suicide exception by way of amendment, if that is what he intended to take out. However, the Minister has not done that rather he has restored the ambiguity to Article 40. 3.3º which the Supreme Court had taken out in the X case. That was extremely foolish. It is also self-evident that in the absence of legislation it is not clear now and will not be clear in the future what the words mean. Of course, that is not the sum total of the problem. Even if we could now establish what the words mean that is not necessarily what they will mean in five years or ten years time, as a subsequent Supreme Court interpret them in accordance with the mores of the time in line with the Preamble of the Constitution. It is worth noting that the X case was not the only constitutional adjudication on Article 40. 3.3º. There were previous cases also. The same judges in previous cases of quite recent date — it is interesting to read the judgments — took a view [785] far closer to that of the proposers of Article 40. 3.3º than they took in the X case. It seems that the same judges changed their view fairly dramatically over a very short period of time about the essence of the case relating to Article 40. 3.3º. That being so, I see no reason the same or different judges could not change their view fairly dramatically again in the future. The third point I should like to make is that previous judges of the Supreme Court, particularly chief justices going back as far as the time of the late Cearbhail Ó Dalaigh, have always argued that the Constitution is an organic document, that it is not possible to rely totally on just one section of one Article for one's interpretation and, in so far as the human rights and personal rights sections are concerned, it must be taken in its totality. In drafting this amendment the Minister went to great pains to draw a distinction — for many of us this is an unreal enough distinction — between threats to life and threats to health. In interpreting the Constitution organically, there are other personal rights in it also. For example, the Minister has quoted and waved the stick of the Bourne case in the United Kingdom at us. He argued that he must include the phrase 'as distinct from the health' as otherwise it would lead to a widespread abortion on demand and he quoted the British experience as a precedent. That is not the precedent in the United States. In the Roe v. Wade case in the United States the constitutional interpretation was pinned on concepts of privacy, privacy of the woman, and bodily integrity. These concepts are unenumerated rights in the Irish Constitution also and I suggest a Supreme Court in the future will not be able to rely totally on simply an interpretation of Article 40. 3.3º together with this amendment but will have to go right back into the panoply of personal rights contained in the Constitution and measure one against the other. It is not possible——;2628048

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I want to put on the record that I appreciate what Deputy Bruton said earlier in so far as he had taken advice on certain aspects of this matter. He fully recognised that the use of the words 'as distinct from the Health' is in no way to mean giving less care and consideration to the health of the mother. That was generous of him. He put it on the record and he accepts that if that impression is given by the words as framed, it is the wrong impression. It is [883] an important thing for him to say and I gladly acknowledge it. There is nothing that can be interpreted as not allowing all medical attention to be given to a pregnant mother in so far as her health and the protection of her life is concerned. I had hoped I would not have to waste any time in dealing with a matter which Deputy Shatter persisted in raising on Second Stage, and on occasion today, regarding the words used in the decisions of the judges of the Surpreme Court. I would ask the Deputy to look again at those judgments. I could give quotations to show that all the judges, as well as the Chief Justice, were talking about life, not health. I take it Deputy Shatter agrees that Mr. Justice Finlay made that reference. The late Mr. Justice McCarthy used the phrase 'when there is a real and substantial risk attached to her [the mother's] survival'. Survival, I would suggest to Deputy Shatter means life, not health.;2628050

1372;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;(Limerick East): I have two very simple points to make. I am advocating that the Minister is foolish to proceed without having a Bill before the House to spell out his intention or, alternatively, committing himself fairly strongly to legislation as soon as the amendment is passed and giving us an idea of what the legislation would contain. I have two further points to make to support this view. Our Supreme Court has modelled itself to a considerable extent on the type of Supreme Court in the United States of America. This is particularly so in terms of the kind of judicial extension of boundaries we have had in Ireland since the middle sixties when various Supreme Courts found a variety of unenumerated rights in the Constitution. In accordance with this, it is relevant, as it is in America, to know who is appointed to the Supreme Court personalities come into this. It would be possible to predict certain types of adjudications if one were to suppose that certain people who are now loud in the Law Library were appointed to the Supreme Court in, say, ten years time. Again, it needs legislation to give any certainty otherwise we are transferring a primary function of this House to persons unknown who will be members of the Supreme Court in the future. The Minister seems to be extraordinarily macho about introducing legislation if the amendment fails on 3 December. He has given commitments that there will be legislation to enshrine in law the decision of the Supreme Court. It seems the only reason the Minister is not bringing forward legislation arising [787] from today's amendment is political cowardice. He is afraid it will not get through the Oireachtas. If that kind of modest proposal would not get through the Oireachtas to spell out in what circumstances intervention is permissible to save a mother's life, how can the Minister suggest that legislation will get through the Oireachtas which would enshrine in law the totality of the Supreme Court judgment? We have to take it that the Minister is not being fully honest with us and that he is simply waving a stick about legislation being introduced to enshrine the Supreme Court judgment in our law. A far more modest proposal would be to spell out in legislation exactly what is meant by these words.;2628058

1375;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Garret FitzGerald;Fine Gael;I support a point made by Deputy Noonan. I raised the point on Second Stage, which the Minister did not answer, as to why 49 of these 55 words are required. The Minister made it clear in his opening speech that the sole reason for the amendment was to deal with the issue of self-destruction or suicide. Leaving aside the question of whether or not we want to eliminate that, if it is the sole reason, on what grounds are the other 49 words included? The logical thing would have been to draft a sentence such as 'Notwithstanding the above, a risk of self-destruction shall not be regarded as a threat to life' or words to that effect. When such a fundamental point is raised on the inherent self-contradiction in the amendment, the Minister ought to reply. I am sorry he did not do so on Second Stage and I feel he should do so now. Unless he can offer a very compelling explanation of that contradiction, there is no case whatever for the amendment to the Constitution as now drafted, even in terms of what the Minister wants to do. On the question of whether one should or should not exclude the case of self-destruction, it is an extremely difficult issue, on which I have great difficulty in making up my own mind. The case either way is compelling and it is very hard to know the right thing to do. [788] Certainly if that is the sole purpose, the Minister would need to tell us what the other 49 words are for.;2628061

Many of the matters are referred to in amendments Nos. 14 and 15. I have no difficulty in responding to some of the items raised, but the Chair is asking me to make a Second Stage contribution or a continuation of my reply to matters raised on Second Stage.

When he replied he just said that the Government are not persuaded of the case. He did not [789] elaborate.

The Minister intends to use this vehicle for further amendments to an already deficient constitutional amendment. It has been proven to be deficient in the view of the public. We expressed views on it but we were outvoted. We are adding insult to injury. Does this require legislation? The Minister said 'no' before but he might say 'yes' now.;2628070

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;We have now had nearly one hour and 20 minutes of this debate, during which Deputies have raised serious issues. We are raising queries and questions which have not been satisfactorily answered by the Minister. I am anxious to avoid our having to raise these issues again if the Minister does not respond. We should hear what he has to say. Perhaps we will then make progress.;2628072

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Jim Tunney;Fianna Fáil;The Chair was not going to be so bold as to prevent the Minister from replying. I was suggesting to the Minister that he would make his reply as brief as possible without extending the debate further. Because the debate has been extended, we cannot entirely exclude the Minister from replying and he will reply now. However, in respect of future comments I hope we will bear in mind that generally speaking, in the opinion of the Chair, the contributions for the past hour were not exactly in accordance with Standing Orders governing Committee Stage debate. That is the point the Chair wanted to make. The Minister will now reply.;2628073

Unless the Minister can give some reason for 49 of the words, I have to oppose it. I cannot know whether to oppose it if the Minister does not answer the question. There must be some reason for having these words. The Minister must have some idea in mind. I want to know the reason so that I will know how to vote. It is essential that we get this information on section 1. Where else can we get it?;2628074

In the interests of order in the House, may I take it that when the Minister has made whatever observations he sees fit to make, it will be open to me and other Deputies in the House to go back and seek to elaborate on observations he might have made or, if necessary, to remind him of gaps in the observations he might be about to make, so that we can clarify things further.;2628077

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;The words 'inevitable or immediate' were used in the Attorney General's submission. Both Fine Gael and the Labour Party have tabled amendments seeking to remove the words 'save the life' and to replace them with the words 'protect the life of the mother'. I query very seriously why the words 'save the life' are in this amendment. Presumably this amendment was sent by the Attorney General's office to the office of the Minister for Justice, was discussed within the Cabinet group that sought to reach a decision on this issue and then presented to us. I have very serious reservations as to whether this wording will allow medical intervention to take place in circumstances where there is a long term as opposed to a short term risk to the life of the mother.;2628079

Be that as it may, we can move along and, I hope, get some kind of understanding on the matter. Amendment No. 1 was ruled out of order, and of course it is out of order for me to refer to it now.;2628080

1399;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;It was raised on a couple of occasions and Deputies De Rossa and McCartan seemed to think it was an important matter on which to contribute. It is hardly being seriously suggested in the House that the people who voted by such a large majority to include Article 40. 3.3º in the Constitution would be likely now, nine years later, to reverse their views and vote to remove Article 40. 3.3º from the Constitution. That prospect is not likely and, because of that, I regard the amendment as academic. I fail to understand why it is being pursued but, be that as it may, people are entitled to comment. Deputy Bruton referred to a remark I made in my Second Stage contribution when I raised the question of legislation and the possibility of legislation being introduced to supplement the amendment. In responding to Deputy Bruton when winding up the debate——;2628085
1400;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;That was not a reply. That was a straightforward dismissal of the other point of view.;2628086
1401;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I said that the test proposed in the amendment was straighforward and it was based on whether termination of pregnancy is necessary to save the life of the mother. I indicated I did not think it would give rise to any difficulty in practice and that I would certainly listen to contributions made in that regard but that it did not seem to us then, nor does it seem to us now, having listened to some of the contributions that have been made with regard to the possibility of introducing legislation in advance of the amendment, that that suggestion holds water. I gave a brief outline of my reasons for refusing that suggestion when summing up Second Stage debate. I specifically mentioned that the amendment which the Deputies talked about would, in effect, negative the suicide aspect of the Supreme Court test for the termination of pregnancy. Any legislation to supplement the amendment would have to take that change in the law into account. It is reasonable to suggest that it would [793] be objectionable even from the legal point of view, not to talk of the general point involved, to bring legislation before the House and almost through the House in anticipation of the outcome of the decision of the people in a referendum. That would not be an appropriate thing to do or to contemplate. It would be unusual to have legislation introduced on the assumption that something will happen, but not quite finalise it, while awaiting something to happen. Apart from being unusual, Deputy Bruton will agree that it would seem somewhat bizarre to proceed in that fashion. I left that aside and said I would listen to further argument to see if there was a good basis for contemplating what the Deputy had in mind. I got alternative views even from among his own party. Deputy Nuala Fennell expressed the view that it should be left aside entirely, that we should deal with this matter of legislation in isolation and leave the amendment until some other time. That is not possible.;2628087

Whether the legislation was to be finalised before the referendum or afterwards was not quite clear, but that was his opinion. I see no reason why the European Court of Human Rights should challenge a provision which is designed to protect women. Whether or not there is detailed legislation in addition to the amendment does not seem to me to have any bearing on that issue. Deputy Shatter made comments about different things. He said that because the interpretation of the constitutional amendment is a matter for the Supreme Court legislation is necessary to say what the interpetation of the words should be. I put it to Deputy Shatter that, whether or not legislation is enacted, the interpretation of the amdendment would still be a matter for the courts, just as the interpretation of any legislation would be a matter for the courts, and any legislation [796] enacted could put an interpretation on the amendment which would be binding on the Supreme Court if the court took a different view.;2628111

If he wishes to test it he obviously will be calling a vote before too long anyway and he will be testing it then in the most effective way possible. I accept what he says — basically, that the courts, if asked in a specific case will make any interpretation they see fit. The fact that there are disparate interpretations knocking about outside this House might be reflected upon as being different attitudes to things we have agreed upon rather than as a difference of opinion in so far as the interpretations of the words are concerned. That is a different matter and we have seen some element of that this afternoon. The arguments of some people who are opposing certain elements of this legislation bear no relationship with the understanding I know is coming from the Opposition side of the House. We heard a good instance of it this afternoon. There are certain individuals in the House who do not want this amendment——;2628121

I am saying that a different point if view has been expressed by Deputy McCartan and others in this House and it is that we should not be here discussing this matter at all, that there should be no amendment put to the Irish people on 3 December and that the only thing we should be doing is removing what is already there——;2628123

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;——which I understand was accepted by all sides of the House. As I understood it we all accepted that Article 40. 3.3º should stay in the Constitution in that it sets out to guarantee the right to life of the unborn and the equal right to life of the mother. I understand that is something we all subscribe to. However, it has been indicated that that is not being subscribed to with as good a will and so collective an understanding by certain Deputies. I regret that that is the way it is but at least today, unlike on Second Stage, we are getting the true position of a certain Deputy or Deputies on the whole question of abortion and the introduction of abortion services into this country.;2628125

Deputy Shatter had not as many supporting him on the previous occasion when this matter was raised by me and I heard shouts from the side asking me to name people. It was necessary to name them then because I knew that, as sure as day follows night, when the time came they would put their marker down. They have done so today so that at least those outside have a good idea how Deputies McCartan and De Rossa view this matter. I presume that what Deputy Shatter says — and I must [799] be careful how I phrase this — represents what some of the other Deputies in Democrat Left feel on this matter. I am pleased to hear that finally.;2628127

It was their wish that the legislators would act in a certain way. They also made it quite clear in the way they addressed the 1983 amendment that they did not wish to see any changes made without the matter being first referred back to them. I would have thought that everybody would have concluded that what we were doing in referring the amendment back to the public was precisely in accordance with their wish expressed in the 1983 referendum.

I am sorry that I did not respond to the points raised by Deputy FitzGerald and I will attempt to do so now. I answered as many of the basic questions as possible in the short time available to me and thought I did so rather well. Indeed, some of the Deputies on the other side of the House suggested to me afterwards that I had made a decent effort to respond to the points made in the limited time avilable.

They want to see some protection for pregnant women, which is one of the [804] fundamental aims of the amendment and they want them to be entitled to receive whatever treatment is necessary where there is a substantial risk to their life. They want to see this right enshrined in the Constitution. They want to see Article 40. 3.3º retained in so far as the right to life of the unborn is concerned, with the mother having an equal right to life. The public know exactly what they want and it is our contention that the wording will ensure this neatly. I am pleased to learn today that some of the senior people who commented on this matter on a previous occasion now feel that we have got it right in that regard. I sincerely hope that the House will also accept this before the end of the day. I have already referred to what Deputy Fennell said in relation to the proposal that the referendum should be cancelled. I do not think I should say anything further except that I believe Deputy Fennell is wrong in that regard although she expressed it in a fervent way. I suggest that the amendment should be disposed of along with the other two referenda on 3 December and that that is the best way to proceed. This is no more than what the general public expect of us. The Government proposal that the referenda on the right to travel and information as well as on the substantive issue should be held on 3 December has received a warm welcome. It is my understanding that the vast majority of Deputies who represent the vast majority of the people of this country also share this opinion. Deputy Noonan spent some time in dealing with a previous judgment handed down by Mr. Justice Walsh in which he stated that no interpretation of the Constitution can be final for all time. I suppose that is true and I see nothing wrong with that. Deputy Noonan also made the point that times change and that the questions of prudence, charity and justice would apply in the judgements given by judges at various times. Indeed, I thought he was making the case for me at one stage. We are trying to clear up whatever ambiguities might have arisen, in so far as the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution is concerned, from the Supreme [805] Court interpretation that suicide could be regarded as a ground for the termination of pregnancy where there is a substantial risk to the life of the mother. However, they set out the test clearly. It would be fair to say that no one foresaw the Supreme Court judgment of 5 March this year but, as I said, they set out in some detail the test to be applied. As I have quoted this test on a couple of previous occasions it is not necessary for me to do so again. They made it possible for us, in regard to the language used in the judgement handed down in the X case, to frame an amendment to deal with the matter referred to by Deputy Noonan. It was for that reason that the language used in the amendment was chosen. In using the language used in the Supreme Court judgment I put it to the House that it is not now necessary to do what Deputy Bruton suggested. I have not heard any good argument which would convince me otherwise, but that does not mean that the matter is finished even today. Deputy Noonan went further about the possibility of the amendment failing. I do not contemplate that. I think the vast majority of people will see precisely what was intended here. I predict that any element of confusion — to which people have referred — about understanding can be cleared up between now and the date of the referendum. It is my hope there will be a resounding understanding by way of a 'yes' vote on the part of the electorate. Taking a hypothetical case of the electorate deciding to vote 'no', I say to Deputies Barnes and Noonan one would have very little alternative except to take that as a clear indication they wanted the matter attended to other than by seeking to change the Supreme Court judgement of 5 March last. We are saying we want to take out suicide as a ground for termination of pregnancy. If the electorate said 'no' in those circumstances they would be saying to us 'no, we do not want that'. Obviously the implication of the alternative is that, in some circumstance, termination of pregnancy must be permitted. That would require legislation I accept that. I would regret it but it would [806] be the will of the people and would have to be attended to in that fashion. Therefore, I contend that was a very fair thing to say rather than leave some people in some kind of limbo, asking what will happen if there is a rejection of the referendum proposal or if it is not endorsed by the people on 3 December next. That was the reason that was said in that way. I think many people thought it was a very fair comment to make because, in those circumstances, the people would have been turning their backs on what we were asking them to do, asking us to accept the full thrust of the Supreme Court judgment which allowed for abortion in certain circumstances in this country. We do not want that and we are asking the people to support us in that matter. Deputy FitzGerald maintains the amendment should simply confine itself to saying that self-destruction should not be a ground for termination of pregnancy. I might point out that the present amendment does three things. It enshrines the Supreme Court decision except, of course, in the case of proposed self-destruction Deputy FitzGerald is quite right there. It excluded self-destruction and, by using the phrase 'as distinct from the health' ensures that in the future health could not become a ground for termination of pregnancy. That was specifically using Supreme Court language in order to prevent abortion being introduced into this country by some other means, as has happened in other jurisdictions, thereby creating circumstances in which there would be widespread abortion available. We did not want that. Somebody said to me that sounded harsh. I replied that we looked at a whole range of words that could have accommodated the same thing in another way. However, it reverted to the simple fact that if one is to do it effectively one must use the Supreme Court language itself, so that whatever interpretation there has been already more than likely will withstand the test of time in so far as the language used would be the same. That was the reason for that. It is being used [807] only to ensure that abortion cannot be introduced into our jurisdiction on some other ground, some other day. We wanted to prevent what Deputy Shatter referred to, the possibility of another referendum in a couple of short years. We were seeking also to endeavour to put in place circumstances in which matters would not be referred to the Supreme Court if at all possible but, of course, as we have all said, anybody can take a case we are all agreed on that. However, the use of the language, as in this amendment, we think overcomes the matters raised by the individuals concerned. Certainly it will never overcome the matters raised by Deputies McCartan and De Rossa. We are quite happy in saying that. By and large, that is my answer which I recognise refers to other amendments tabled. Deputies have contended that the amendment might be open to different interpretations by the courts. I should like to revert to that matter in so far as Deputy Shatter's contribution was concerned. What Deputies seem to forget in that regard is that the amendment is based in every single respect, except self-destruction, on the test set out by the Supreme Court. I should like people to remember that because it is the basis of the whole argument that has been going on here, the decision in the X case. Therefore, I believe there is little basis for suggesting that the amendment would be interpreted in any other way. I have nothing more to say except that I would oppose amendment No. 1 tabled by the Democratic Left. The other matters raised substantially by Deputy Bruton and added to in different ways by others have been answered reasonably. We should hold the referendum, have it positively endorsed and I predict it will work without hindrance.;2628176

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;The Minister sought, with characteristic mischievousness, to seek to represent the position of the Fine Gael Party on this matter inaccurately and misleadingly. As he knows, our position is that the House should not consider [808] this amendment of the Constitution until 15 January next by which time the Government should have produced the legislation we believe to be necessary to underpin and explain it, and have that discussed here before we are asked to consider the amendment of the Constitution. It is our view that in that event we would have a much less acrimonious and a more informed debate. I hope the Minister has read me clearly in what I have just said and does not seek to make any attempt to reinterpret that position. Having said that, the Minister missed a few points when replying. The first point he missed was the fact that the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy in the Supreme Court — and the Minister has been quoting the Supreme Court here frequently in support of his position — specifically criticised the Legislature for having failed to bring forward legislation to underpin the existing amendment of the Constitution. Now we are proposing to bring in another amendment of the Constitution supplementing that and are still not going to produce the legislation. Yet, the Minister is quoting the Supreme Court language to justify his wording. Of course, he failed to cite the quotation of the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy which is very relevant, when he excoriated this Legislature in terms I have rarely heard, in perhaps the most extreme criticism of this House from the Bench since the two institutions came into being. I refer to the criticism of the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy of this House and successive Governments since 1983 for failing to introduce that legislation. For us to carry on this debate, ignoring that statement of the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy, is unreal in that he made it quite clear that they, the Supreme Court, wanted to intepret the Constitution on the basis of legislation also to supplement, explain and deal with the particular aspects of it. The late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy went on to say that as far as abortion was concerned the Legislature had two responsibilities — a negative responsibility to prohibit abortion in circumstances in which it should be prohibited but also a positive responsibility [809] to create conditions in which people would not find themselves having to consider that option. He made it very clear he believed that legislation should be introduced to deal with both the positive and negative responsibilities of the Legislature. He criticised us in particular for having failed to introduce legislation to deal with the positive aspect of creating social conditions and so on whereby people would not find themselves in that position. The Minister appears to me to have failed to address two other points both now and on Second Stage as to why legislation should be introduced. The first point to which he failed to reply was the question of legal liabilities in the event of disputed decisions after the event. For example, would the civil cases that might arise not be likely to be determined on the basis not of existing, well established legal practice, but on the basis of an interpretation of this new wording in the Constitution? If such were the case, to avoid unnecessary litigation and uncertainty, rather than wait for case law to determine what is 'health', what is 'life' and so on, surely we should sort out those things in legislation before enshrining them in the Constitution. Will the Minister deal with that point?;2628179
1494;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Jim Tunney;Fianna Fáil;I hope the Minister will not do so. Earlier I made the point I did not want circumstances to arise where there would be repetition of what had been ruled out of order. I would advise the House that we have before us an order which requires us to finish at 6. 45 p. m. As there are 15 Committee Stage amendments, 13 of which are in order, in deference to Deputies we should resolve to get away from what is out of order and not be perpetuating disorders in this fashion. I ask Deputy Bruton to accept that so that we can proceed in the fashion that obtained in respect of discussion on every Amendment of the Constitution. The question will be put presently 'That the Schedule stand part of the Bill', and a further question will be put 'That the Bill do now pass'. It is most disorderly to accept [810] what occurred earlier as the base on which to operate. We all know that is not in order.;2628180
1495;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;I would hate to find myself in the position of being in conflict with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in a matter of this nature. There is no need for a Schedule if we are not going to have an amendment to the Constitution at this juncture. What we are deciding in section 1 is the issue of whether at this time we need an amendment. It is my contention that we need legislation first, to be followed by an amendment which would be influenced by the debate on the legislation. There are two other points in favour of legislation. First is the issue of conscientious objectors. In the family planning legislation of 1979 there is specific provision for conscientious objectors. It may be that under the proposed Amendment of the Constitution medical people will object even to performing the operations in the limited circumstances set out here. It seems that provision must be made for those conscientious objectors and for people who might have to rely on them for life saving operations. If it was necessary to make such provisions in legislation in 1979 in regard to family planning, which is a much less fraught and contentious matter, surely similar legislation is needed to deal with conscientious objectors in this instance. The Minister should look at Article 27 of the Constitution which provides for legislation to be referred to the people. He made much of his argument which was an interpretation of what the people decided in 1983. He stated that the people said they wanted every such alteration to be subsequently referred to them. Just as people have great difficulty interpreting what the Danish people meant when they voted no to the Maasstricht Treaty, anybody who attempts to say what the people meant when they voted a particular way in a referendum is engaging in a fools' argument. Even taking that assumption as valid, it seems the Minister should look at Article 27 of [811] the Constitution which allows for Bills to be referred to the people. The Minister seemed to misunderstand Deputy Noonan's contribution. He seemed to think Deputy Noonan was arguing in favour of having a constitutional amendment first. As I understand it, what Deputy Noonan said was that if you rely solely on constitutional provisions, because of the way judicial interpretation changes over time and is, influenced by the atmosphere of the times, you will never achieve certainty, and that you are much more likely to achieve certainty through legislation, accompanied perhaps by a constitutional amendment. Legislation, because it deals with matters in greater detail and with all possible eventualities and circumstances that might arise, is much more likely to create certainty and predictability in certain cases than would 55 words in the Constitution. Deputy Noonan elaborated on why legislation is necessary in view of the fact that in the interpretation of the 1983 Amendment the approach of the Judiciary changed in the period between 1983 and 1992. The emphasis of the decision changed significantly even in that short period. If the Minister wants certainty and the entrenchment of particular concepts he would be much more likely to achieve that by legislation, perhaps underpinned by a constitutional amendment than by a constitutional amendment alone. I fail, therefore, to understand the Minister's insistence on this 55 word solution. Far from achieving the objectives he is seeking, he will, as he and others did in 1983, achieve the direct opposite. It behoves the Minister to take seriously the points made on this side of the House. They are not being made simply as debating points they have validity. The Minister stated that even today he is open to argument about legislation being introduced to accompany this Amendment, and I have given him a few examples of where legislation will be patently necessary — in the case of conscientious objectors, legal liabilities, [812] procedures for determining disputes about medical treatments in hospitals and so on. The Minister has simply asserted that the European Court of Human Rights would be as willing to accept 55 words in the Constitution alone as it would to accept 55 words in the Constitution underpinned by legislation. My information — and I have good information — is that the European Court of Human Rights, from past performance in cases in other countries, would be much more likely to uphold a provision in the law of a member state if that was underpinned in detailed legislation which provides for determining disputes and deals with the position of minorities and people who may feel oppressed by a particular decision. The European Court of Human Rights would be much more likely to accept that position than it would a simple blanket provision of 55 words in the Constitution. If the Minister is seeking, as I believe he is, certainty and predictability he should not rely on these 55 words alone because of the risk of them being overturned by the European Convention on Human Rights. That risk could be avoided by underpinning the constitutional amendment by legislation which would be discussed here first. The arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of introducing legislation first, and I hope the Minister will reflect further on this subject in the light of what has been said here.;2628181

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;I would like to refer to two points made by the Minister. Although the Minister, towards the end of his speech, left a door open, he was dismissive of the need for legislation. He said that the constitutional words are clear and straighforward. He used a form of wording that is apparently a mantra to be recited by members of the Fianna Fáil Party whenever this issue comes before the House. I have researched all the debates that took place in 1983 and the Minister was one of the main proponents of the wording which is now in the Constitution. He and Deputy O'Hanlon, who was Health [813] spokesperson for Fianna Fáil, recited the same mantra. At column 469, volume 340 of the Official Report of 17 February 1983, after Members of the Fine Gael Party put on the record of the House reservations about the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, Deputy O'Hanlon said: 'Fianna Fáil believe the wording we put forward is correct and nothing that has been said has convinced us that we should alter that view'. That is a sentence I heard churned out in the Dáil last week on Second Stage and the Minister told us again today that nothing he has heard indicates that he should alter his view. If I were Minister I would be a little more timorous in my approach to this matter. I would drop the theatrical self-righteous indignation he engaged in at the beginning of his response to Members on this side of the House in the light of his record and that of his colleague in getting this issue utterly and totally wrong in the area of constitutional amendments. In dealing with the specific issue of legislation, the Minister said that 'publication of legislation would be objectionable because of the constitutional position.' In other words, we could not possibly publish legislation based on an amendment to the Constitution because the existing legislation could be unconstitutional. The Minister said it would be a most unusual stance to take to publish such legislation. Indeed he went on to say that it would be 'bizarre' to publish legislation based on a change in the Constitution. I scratched my head when I heard that because the remark came from the same Minister who, approximately ten days before publication of the three Bills, including the Bill we are debating, published a paper on marital breakdown. What did it contain? It contained a suggestion that we might amend the Constitution in the area of divorce with five possible constitutional Articles, none of which has yet been put to the people, none of which forms any legislation in front of the House and none of which will be dealt with in a referendum during the lifetime of this Government. But what [814] did we find in this document? The Government's proposed legislation to provide for divorce if the Constitution was changed. Apparently what is 'bizarre' in addressing this area is the norm in addressing another area if it is acceptable and usual to publish a proposed divorce Bill in the context of the legislation the Government might introduce if the prohibition on divorce was removed from the Constitution, what makes it bizarre to introduce and publish legislation that the Government might — and indeed should — introduce if this amendment, or a modified form of it, was made to the Constitution?;2628183
1498;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh.

It now seems to the Chair that Members are speaking with little or no regard to section 1. They are making general statements, Second Stage speeches and generalising. I should like Members to return to the Committee Stage procedures. We should dispose of section 1 as it is irrelevant to what is being said. The same applies to section 2 and we could then get down to the main business of the amendments to the Schedule.;2628184
1499;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh.

1501;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;Section 1 is relevant because, as the previous speaker, Deputy John Bruton, indicated, it is the section which triggers the holding of a referendum in the context of these words going into the Constitution. Members on this side of the House have made it clear that legislation is needed in advance of this trigger being pulled. This trigger has already exploded as a result of the Minister getting things extremely, extraordinarily and bizarrely wrong in 1983. Apparently he is willing to put his finger to the trigger again and make it explode without providing the details of necessary legislation. The Minister, in his reply to the case being made that section 1 should not [815] proceed without legislation, asked what way such legislation would influence the Supreme Court in interpreting the Article. The Minister should be aware that there is a plethora of Supreme Court decisions in relation to legislation which has been tested against the contents of the Constitution. In that context, in any legislation published after 1937 the Supreme Court start on the premise that the legislation has a presumption of constitutionality. In so far as this Article' provides the skeleton of principle to be applied in dealing with situations which affect the lives of mothers, women and indeed unborn children, detailed legislation would provide a comprehensive substance to the application and implementation of the Article. If such legislation was put in place it would be a starting point for the Supreme Court in applying these provisions and they would only set it aside if it was unconstitutional. You cannot divorce the need for legislation from the enactment of an Article. If this provision, like that of 1983, causes so much confusion and is open to so many disparate interpretations, the lesson of 1983 should be that we need legislation in this area if we are to have another referendum on this issue. It is not satisfactory for the Minister to tell us that there is less confusion outside today than there was a week ago he has merely to pick up his newspaper to see the totally contradictory pronouncements by a variety of people who approach this issue from different angles, all from an interpretation they have taken from the 55 words. A Cheann Comhairle, you — or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle — asked why we raise this issue in the context of section 1. We are doing so because, if we do not get a satisfactory response from the Minister, we will vote against it.;2628187
1502;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Seán Treacy;The Labour Party;I call Deputy Dukes. Again I appeal for contributions relevant to section 1, we should proceed seriatim, which is the normal procedure on Committee Stage of Bills.;2628188
1503;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;I intend my remarks to be relevant to section 1 and I hope, Sir, not to be in conflict with you. I will endeavour not to be. However, as Deputy Shatter said, this is the trigger section which provides basically for two things. It says: 'Article 40. 3 of the Constitution is hereby amended'. It sets out to amend the Constitution and it goes on to provide that it will be amended as provided for in the Schedule. Deputy John Bruton pointed out why we believe that is the wrong procedure and why we should not have the words in the Schedule — or indeed any other words — without first enacting legislation. I should like to dwell for a moment or two on why I believe it is wrong to provide that the Constitution should be amended, as the first part of this section sets out. Deputy Shatter referred to the lessons of the Eighth Amendment but the Minister and the Government do not seem to have referred to anything that happened in 1983. Those of us involved in the debate in 1983 will have a very clear memory of the fact that the proposal for amending the Constitution at that stage rested on a very simple proposition, that neither politicians nor the courts are to be trusted. I am afraid that some people may read the X case as being a vindication of that suspicion but, of course, they would be totally wrong because, what most of those critics seem to forget — and what most of those who claimed in 1983 that the courts could not be trusted seem to forget — is that our Constitution expressly provides that the Supreme Court are the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. They are not the final framer of the Constitution, that is for the people, but they are the ultimate interpreter and if we put words into our Constitution no Member of this House can say to the people with 100 per cent assurance what those words mean. We cannot do that because, in the event that somebody with a proper local standi in the issues takes a different view, the matter must be referred to the Supreme Court the Constitution will mean what the Supreme Court say it means. I have heard colleagues of the Minister [817] for Justice — and others on the Government side of the House — say, wisely, as we were passing legislation through this House, that it did not matter what we said because the courts would not read the record of our proceedings and would not be bound by any meaning we might state here. That may well have been true and wise but it is a much more apposite comment in the case of an amendment to the Constitution. It is futile for the Minister for Justice to come into the House to say that he is satisfied beyond a shadow of a doubt that the meaning of these words is what he says it is — rather than maybe what the Minister for Health said the previous night — and that there can never be any dispute about it. The nine years which have passed since 1983 have surely given us all ample reason to understand that such assurances cannot be given. I am not casting doubt on the sincerity of the Minister's intentions, all I am saying is that the record and the constitutional reality show that we cannot accept an assurance of that kind from the Minister, even without including any intent on his part to mislead us. He cannot give such an assurance. At the end of the day we have no option but to trust the Supreme Court because that is what our Constitution provides. Of course, there is always the option if we disagree with a decision the Supreme Court has made, as many people do in this instance, to consider changing the Constitution. But, again, the lesson of 1983 and the Eighth Amendment should be that we proceed with great care because we are not the Supreme Court, we are not the final interpreters any more than the people are the final interpreters. The route of a constitutional modification should be taken only if we are very clear in our minds what we want to do and why we want to do it. I do not think the Government are very clear in their collective mind — if such still exists today — on what they want to do and why they want to do it. The other basis for the proposal to have a constitutional amendment in 1983, and the reason we are having this debate today, was that politicians are [818] not to be trusted. There was a feeling that there was some movement of opinion in the House that the proponents of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution did not like. Those people should remember why we elect Members of this House. We elect Members because in a democracy — even one as small as ours with 3. 5 million people — it is hardly practical to have everyone involved all the time in making the decisions. We delegate people to make decisions on our behalf, hence, the word 'Teachta.' It also has the advantage that because Members are relatively near the electorate and they have to come back to the people at least once very five years — it happens a little more often than that — they can be held accountable for what they do. If this House were to do something that was utterly repugnant to the majority of people, the people have a remedy. They could put other people in place of any or all of the 166 Deputies. The basic motivation of the people who proposed the original amendment that got us into all this trouble was highly suspect, both constitutionally and in the logic of their position. They should remember — and it would do a number of them no harm to remember now — that another advantage of having issues of this kind dealt with by the normal process of the Houses of the Oireachtas, through legislation, is that it is easier to change legislation if it appears there is a flaw in it than it is to change the Constitution. There is another reason for legislation. I have had many discussions in the past nine years, and particularly in the past couple of months, with people who, like the Minister, say that the Supreme Court decision in the X case went against what people thought they were voting for when they voted for the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution in 1983. Such people keep coming naively back to the proposition that there must be some simple form of words that we could put into the Constitution to do what we think and the Minister thinks he is setting out to do. [819] The more we try, the more it becomes evident that it is not possible to do that. I am sure the Minister for Justice would have been one of the people to say, perhaps six or nine months ago, if the question had been put to him, that there must be a simple way of resolving this matter by putting a few words into the Constitution. The Schedule proposes the addition of 55 words. The Minister for Justice has a different view from that of the Minister for Health on what those words mean both Ministers have a different view from that of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not believe any of them. I am not trying to be facetious and I am not accusing any one Member of insincerity — stupidity maybe but not insincerity. It is very clear that the Government, even having gone to the trouble of trying to put a clear amendment into the Constitution, have failed. The reason they have failed is that the issues they are dealing with are very complex. Those issues cannot be described or provided for in a text that is not itself complex. I do not know whether the parallel is exact, but I defy any Member, no matter how well qualified technically and no matter how gifted linguistically, to describe without the use of a diagram the working of a differential gear in the driving axle of a car. That is a very straightforward mechanical process, but it cannot be described in simple words because the issue involved cannot be dealt with in that way. When we add to this particular issue, which is much more complex, the fact that our understanding of the human person and of the human body continues to expand and that medical practice and medical treatments keep advancing — things are possible now that were not even dreamt of 20 years ago, and that will continue — it must be clear to any reasonable person that one cannot safely do what the Government seem to want to do, by the wording, complex as it is, in the Schedule. The Government are [820] engaged in an enterprise that is bound to fail. I have heard assurances from different Ministers and from other people in the past couple of weeks——;2628189
1504;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;I have not yet had an opportunity to talk on the Committee Stage in relation to the amendments that are being dealt with. I should like to deal with certain aspects of the amendments. The Minister constantly makes an inaccurate statement — one with which Minister O'Dea, who briefly visited the Chamber this evening, seemed to agree — that the formula now presented to us derives directly from what the Supreme Court decided. The Minister correctly states that the Chief Justice made the distinction in his judgment when he referred to the life as distinct from the health of a woman. The Minister then takes unto himself insights of de Valeran proportion when he attempts to look into his heart to discover what was in the minds of the other four members of the Supreme Court, none of whom sought to make that distinction. It is an outrageous inaccuracy for the Minister to justify what is an appalling distinction in this wording — a distinction that is justifiably causing a great deal of concern to women, a distinction that should not be in a Constitution — by stating constantly that he is reflecting what is stated by the Supreme Court, because in the context of the majority judgments none of the judges with the exception of the Chief Justice made such distinction or felt that there was need to make such distinction. To state that to remove the words 'as distinct from the health' from the amendment would in some way provide an open door to abortion [867] on demand is such a gross misrepresentation as to be unworthy of the Minister, though it is worthy of the kind of approach we had from him in 1983. In deference to colleagues who want to make a contribution, I do not want to delay the House by repeating the quotations from the judgments of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, Mr. Justice Egan and Mr. Justice McCarthy which I put on the record of the House during the Second Stage debate. Suffice it to say that not one of those judges felt the need to make that distinction. What the Government are attempting to do is to insert a distinction into our Constitution which is, in legal terms, an obiter dicta of the Chief Justice, which was irrelevant to the decision that was reached because there was no question in that case other than that the mother's life was at risk and that issue was not teased out. In this context it should be said that we have a great deal of worry that what the Government are trying to achieve in this amendment is something the Attorney General unsuccessfully attempted to achieve in the Supreme Court. Deputy Bruton, and other Deputies, correctly pointed out that a number of the words contained in this Article — if the Minister is trying to rely on the Chief Justice — do not arise in the judgment of the Chief Justice. Nowhere in his judgment did the Chief Justice talk about a necessity to save the life of the mother. The words 'save the life' do not appear in the judgment of the Chief Justice. Indeed, one has a great deal of worry as to why that phrase is used. Deputy Spring correctly asked whether, for the mother who does not require immediate medical treatment to save her life and it is only something that may be required in the long term, it will be available. The Minister is giving us assurances and telling us of his intentions on this, that and the other but, of course, the intentions of the Minister are irrelevant, it is what is in the wording that is important. It is worth referring to one passage in the judgment of the Chief [868] Justice which has not been referred to in this debate. On page 32 he referred to the need for a harmonious interpretation of the Constitution and the necessity that it be carried out with concepts of prudence, justice and charity, to which my colleague Deputy Noonan referred earlier. He went on to say: It leads me to the conclusion that in vindicating and defending as far as practicable the right of the unborn to life but at the same time giving due regard to the right of the mother to life, that the Court must, amongst the matters to be so regarded, concern itself with the position of the mother within a family group, with persons on whom she is dependent, with, in other instances, persons who are dependent upon her and her interaction with other citizens and members of society in the areas in which her activities occur. In other words, in determining issues relating to the life of the mother the Chief Justice said a broad number of matters must be dealt with and addressed. These have not been explained. Neither the Minister nor the Attorney General in his statement explained how this portion of the judgment of the Chief Justice fits into the proposal we now have. What is interesting is the following reference by the Chief Justice to the Attorney General's submission: Having regard to that conclusion, I am satisfied that the test proposed on behalf of the Attorney General that the life of the unborn could only be terminated if it were established that an inevitable or immediate risk to the life of the mother existed, for the avoidance of which a termination of the pregnancy was necessary, insufficiently vindicates the mother's right to life. In other words, the Attorney General, on behalf of the Government, in the Supreme Court and in the High Court stated that for there to be a medical intervention to terminate a pregnancy there was a need for an immediate risk to the life of the mother. I wonder whether what [869] the Attorney General could not achieve in the Supreme Court he is now attempting to achieve in the wording before us now in this House.;2628190

1507;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Seán Treacy;The Labour Party;Please, Deputy Dukes. We are making no progress on this Bill. We are getting bogged down on section 1. We are hearing Second Stage speeches, generalising, and we are getting nowhere. As far as the Chair is concerned, the procedure is wrong. I have consistently appealed to Members to work with me in getting to the nitty-gritty of the issues and the amendments before us, but Members are not prepared to play the game. Are we or are we not going to get away from sections 1 and 2 and discuss the amendments? The Chair hesitates to intervene in this way, especially on the Committee Stage of a Bill to which is applied a rigid time limit. It is for Members to decide how they should utilise that short, precious time and it should not be a function of the Chair to put pressure on Members. However, I am concerned about the clear violation of the Committee Stage procedure which is going on here today. It is a clear violation of all I have learnt in respect of dealing with the Committee Stage of a Bill. I ask Members to finalise this section and the section thereafter, to which no amendments are tabled, and let us move to the Schedule, to which all of the amendments apply. I ask for co-operation in dealing with these matters as the House knows they should be dealt with. Deputy Dukes and so many others have long experience in this House and know how to deal with a Committee Stage.;2628193

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;I understand your concerns, Sir, and if I speak quietly it is because I do not want to be argumentative. However, my remarks are addressed to the two issues: One, that the Constitution is hereby amended by the addition of the words in section 1 (a) and (b), and, two, by the Schedule to the Bill. I am trying to point out why I disagree with the proposition that the Constitution be hereby amended without first — as Deputy Bruton has proposed — having legislation to clarify the issues. The issues are too complex and too important to too many people to be dealt with by way of a constitutional amendment as proposed here. I suggest that the example we have of the last constitutional amendment to deal with the issues covered in this Bill amply demonstrates why that particular approach is so unwise.;2628194

1515;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;I should like to come to another reflection, if I may. The Minister has relied several times, during the course of this afternoon's debate, on the assertion that people will see what is intended. We have had discussion about why the Minister believes that what he is proposing in this Bill is needed in order to give effect to what people intended in 1983. What I am saying is that, given the delicacy and the complexity of these issues, it is not enough to say to people that they know what he intends and that we know what the people intend — which ever way they vote — in order to be satisfied that the issue is dealt with. The experience of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution shows that in the final analysis it matters not a great deal what people thought they intended when they were voting for the text what matters at the end of the day is what the Supreme Court says that amendment of the Constitution means, and it is not enough for the Minister to continue to assure us. In conclusion, the Minister illustrated just how fraught with danger this kind of assertion is when he stood up a few minutes ago and started to speculate as to how we might interpret what he calls the hypothetical case of a negative vote on this referendum. If people were to vote No to this text on 3 December how would we interpret that? Would that mean that they objected to the insulting words 'as distinct from the health of the mother' that are being used? Would it mean they were in disagreement with what the Minister is proposing about an inclination to self-destruction? Or would it mean that people did not want to see abortion under any circumstances? Or would it mean there were certain medical treatments with which people disagreed? Or would it simply mean that people had got so fed up with the confusion and the nonsense that has taken place on the Government side for the past couple of weeks that they just said, a plague on all your houses, we will not [823] have anything to do with any of this? I do not know whether anybody could interpret or read it. I certainly would not be able to do so. If this matter is put to the people on 3 December — and the Minister has given no explanation why we must have it on 3 December — and they vote No, as I would hope they would vote if this is the text and all we have before us, I would not be able to come into this House on the following day or even the following year after studying it all and give an indication with any certainty as to why people had voted No any more than anybody is able to tell me today why people voted Yes in 1983 or what they had in mind then when they voted Yes. I would ask the Minister, and I have deliberately refrained from being provocative, to reflect on those things again, if having been one of those — and he was in very wide company in 1983, some of it very august and sanctified — who advised people solemnly in 1983 that if they voted Yes to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, abortion could never happen in this country and now having found that given our constitutional procedures — of which I suppose he is a defender and good republican — and having lived through that experience, he has not come to the conclusion that with the best will in the world it is not open to him to give people the kind of assurances he has given them for the past few weeks and that it would, therefore, be prudent to deal with the details of this matter legislatively before we go any further with a referendum on this issue, the subject of this Bill.;2628201
1516;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Garret FitzGerald;Fine Gael;A net point arising from section 1 is whether the section is desirable. The Minister's justification for 49 of the 55 words in the section was that they were replicating what the Supreme Court had said. First of all, if he were replicating what the Supreme Court said, it would be a work of supererogation because, they having said it, it is in fact the constitutional position, and putting it in the Constitution would do no good at [824] all. Secondly, he is not doing that, he is taking the exact words of one judge and not using them. I do not know how he can say he is using them. The words the judge used were: ... if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy, that such termination is permissible .... The wording here is quite different, 'unless such termination is necessary to save the life'— words which the judge did not use —'where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, it shall be unlawful to terminate the life'. If he wanted to replicate the judgment, which would be unnecessary anyway, what he should have said in this wording was: 'it shall be lawful to terminate the life of an unborn if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health of the mother, which can be avoided only by the termination of her pregnancy'. He has not done that. Incidentally, I have to say that Mr. Justice Finlay put the word 'only' in the wrong place. Had I indeed been replicating his judgment I would have had a grammatical difficulty because he should have said 'which can be avoided only by the termination of her pregnancy', the words 'only be avoided' are not logical. I would not have argued if the Minister had tampered with the judge's decision to the extent of shifting the word 'only', but when he changes it around completely and makes it unlawful instead of lawful and introduces words such as 'save' and 'necessary' which the judge did not use and when he takes a statement by one judge and says it is a Supreme Court judgment and justifies the amendment by saying he wants to incorporate that wording in the Constitution and then does not do so, but introduces fresh ambiguities with new words, he knows he is talking nonsense. He has in no way justified these words. [825] The only thing he could possibly justify is what he said on Second Stage that he disagrees on the suicide issue. It is a point of view you can accept it or not accept it. Having disagreed on that he would be entitled to bring before the House the last few words and have a wording 'notwithstanding the above, a risk of self-destruction shall not be regarded as a threat to life'. We could have debated that here, some might be for it and some might be against and the House could have decided it. What the House must not do is to incorporate, as a result of section 1, wording which is not wording used by any judge, under the guise of [826] being the Supreme Court judgment, and introduce fresh ambiguities which will have to be interpreted by the Supreme Court eventually, and we have no idea what that interpretation will be. To do that would be unwise and absurd and the Minister has given no possible grounds for it. I cannot see how anybody in this House, on the basis of his arguments, could possibly support this amendment. Cuireadh an cheist. Question put. Rinne an Dáil vótáil. The Dáil divided: Tá, 68 Níl, 56.

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Proinsias De Rossa;Sinn Féin the Workers' Party;Tairgim leasú a 2: I leathanach 7, roimh an Sceideal, an méid seo a leanas a chur isteach: 'SCEIDEAL CUID I Ní theorannóidh fo-alt 3º den alt seo saoirse chun foirceannadh toirchis a chur ar fáil nó a fháil sa Stát chun cosaint a thabhairt ar bhaol réadach substaintiúil do bheatha nó do Shláinte mná torraí ach sin faoi chuimsiú cibé coinníollacha a fhéadfar a leagan síos le dlí. CUID II Subsection 3º of this section shall not limit freedom to provide or obtain, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, termination of a pregnancy in order to protect against a real and substantial risk to the life or health of a pregnant woman.'. [829] I move amendment No. 2: In page 6, before the Schedule to insert the following: 'SCHEDULE PART I Ní theorannóidh fo-alt 3º den alt seo saoirse chun foirceannadh toirchis a chur ar fáil nó a fháil sa Stát chun cosaint a thabhairt ar bhaol réadach substaintiúil do bheatha nó do shláinte mná torraí ach sin faoi chuimsiú cibé coinníollacha a fhéadfar a leagan síos le dlí. PART II Subsection 3º of this section shall not limit freedom to provide or obtain, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, termination of a pregnancy in order to protect against a real and substantial risk to the life or health of a pregnant woman.'. Amendment No. 2 seeks to replace the Government's wording with a new formulation. We have just seen by way of vote that the Government insist they want to proceed with a referendum. I argued on section 1 that if we were to have a referendum it should be to delete Article 40. 3.3º., the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, and thereby revert to the pre-1983 situation and leave this House free to deal with the question of abortion in Ireland in a way the legislators, elected by the people, would find acceptable and would have to defend to their constituents at a future date. That approach has been rejected by the Minister on the basis that he regarded it as an academic approach. I fail to see how the Minister could define it as such, but it has been rejected. In the absence of the Minister accepting that approach I and my colleagues in Democratic Left submit that the wording which the Minister is proposing should be deleted and substituted by the wording of our amendment. It is a positive expression of what might be done in the event of this House legislating for abortion. [830] The amendment states: Subsection 3º of this section shall not limit freedom to provide or obtain, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, termination of a pregnancy in order to protect against a real and substantial risk to the life or health of a pregnant woman. Our amendment would be in addition to Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution and should be read in tandem with the statement therein that the foetus and the woman carrying the foetus have an equal right to life. The Supreme Court has already defined that section of the Constitution as in certain circumstances giving the woman's right to life precedence over that of the foetus. The wording I am suggesting eliminates the proposal by the Minister and his Government that anything outside the conditions proposed in his amendment would be unlawful and, therefore, a criminal act. In a later amendment we propose that the reference to unlawful should be deleted. To include this reference in the Constitution is quite an extraordinary approach not only to this issue but to our Constitution. Nowhere else in the Constitution do we declare anything to be unlawful. We leave it to the Houses of the Oireachtas to make laws and decide what is lawful and unlawful. The Constitution generally states principles on which our laws should be based. I remind the House that approximately 5,000 women per year, or at least a large proportion of them, in effect would be criminalised as a result of the passing of the amendment as proposed by the Government. The majority of those who go to Britain, as I understand the analysis of the statistics, go there not because of a direct physical threat to their lives but for in my view other legitimate reasons. Nevertheless, they would be involved in a criminal act by having an abortion for reasons other than a direct physical threat to their lives if we adopt the Government's amendment. Our amendment also seeks to provide that the termination of pregnancy would be permissible in [831] order to protect the life or the health of the woman. I have no doubt that much of the remaining time in this debate will be devoted to discussing how the Government expect it might be possible that the life of a woman can be distinguished from her health how a doctor may be expected to distinguish a life shortening threat to her life as distinct from an immediate physical threat to her life. Indeed, we have heard conflicting statements from Government spokespersons on whether the Government's amendment is intended to eliminate life shortening illnesses as distinct from an immediate threat to life. On the one hand a Minister told us that it excludes any possibility of a termination in a life shortening situation and provides for situations where there is an immediate threat to life while on the other hand others claim that it is intended to cover both situations and no woman will be refused treatment if her life or, as the Minister claimed, her health are at risk. Our amendment seeks to broaden the capacity of this house to deal with this issue. We very clearly insist in our amendment that health should be included as the basis for a possible termination and that it is to protect against a real and substantial risk to the life or health of a pregnant woman. We also seek to delete the phrase 'mother' from the proposed amendment. By accepting the term 'mother' we willy-nilly accept the thesis that what a woman is carrying from the point of conception is a child. There are serious and widespread differences of opinion, even among Roman Catholic theologians, on this issue. On Sunday a Roman Catholic theologian pointed out on RTE that there is a grave question mark over this issue. I do not wish to delay the House on this issue but it is tendentious to continue to refer to a woman who has become pregnant and is carrying a foetus as a 'mother' without question, it literally accepts the theological argument that life begins at conception. This is only a theological argument it is not a medical argument. [832] There is no consistent medical opinion which says that life begins at conception. Who knows, but perhaps in five or ten years' time it may be proved or disproved. The inclusion of the phrase 'a real and substantial risk' to the health of the woman would also provide for situations where the psychological health of a woman would be at issue. I find it both insulting and difficult to understand how it is possible for the Government to argue on the one had that there is a separation between the life and health of the woman and on the other to go further and argue that her mental health is of no consequence that a threat of self-destruction will be banned and giving any recognition to the threat of self-destruction arising from a crisis pregnancy must, under the Constitution, be ruled out. This seems to be stepping back 100 years to the time when mental illness was regarded as something evil and had nothing to do with the physical well being of a person. It is obvious to anyone, even a lay person like me, that one cannot distinguish between the physical and mental health of any person in society, that one impinges and works on the other. Amendment No. 2 seeks to achieve a situation where people can give their verdict that they want the Dáil to legislate for abortion in certain circumstances where the life and health of a woman is at serious and substantial risk. It states that this should be done by way of legislation in the Dáil it would be regulated by the Dáil. Given the particularly conservative make-up of this Dáil, which is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, it is highly unlikely we will have what the Minister seems to fear, abortion on demand. The fact is that the 1983 Amendment has been interpreted by our Supreme Court in a way which virtually no one anticipated by way of its effect on information and travel and the way it was defined in relation to suicide and the right to a termination. As Deputy Dukes said earlier, it would be far more beneficial for the health of politics and democracy here if the Dáil were allowed to do the job it was elected [833] to do, that is to legislate for the Constitution to lay down the principles and for the Dáil to legislate rather than try to incorporate legislation into our Constitution which is extremely difficult to change for obvious reasons. In a curious way it would probably work more in the interests of the so-called pro-life groups if the Dáil were permitted to legislate in the way it clearly feels it should. I do not want to unnecessarily take up the time of other Deputies in this short debate. The Minister has consistently attempted to portray the Government amendment as a so-called pro-life amendment. I know from statements he is reported to have made at press briefings and so on, that the Taoiseach has said this is not an abortion amendment. The fact is that the Government's briefing paper makes it very explicit that this is an abortion amendment. Although it has not yet been admitted by the Government I assume this briefing document which was given to the Leaders of the Opposition parties was drafted by the Attorney General. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point. Under the heading 'Supreme Court Decision in X Case' the briefing document states: The effect of the Supreme Court decision is that an abortion is permissible in this jurisdiction where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of the pregnancy and that a risk of suicide may constitute a real and substantial risk to life. That is a clear statement that the Supreme Court judgment provided for abortion, termination of a pregnancy. The briefing document goes on to refer to the effect of the proposed Government amendment. It states: The amendment is proposed as an addition to Article 40. 3.3º. The effect is to leave undisturbed the existing affirmative acknowledgment of the right to life of the unborn, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, contained in that Article. [834] The amendment accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in every respect except suicide. It therefore, sets out to negative the decision in respect of suicide but in no other respect. The effect is that where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is endangered, the pregnancy may lawfully be terminated if that is necessary to save her life. That is a very clear, explicit statement that what the Government are proposing is the legalisation of abortion in this State. The Minister should stop the nonsense of trying to claim that in some way this does not permit abortion. The Minister's briefing document states that it does. I welcome the fact that the Minister is at last breaching the theological ramparts that have surrounded this issue for so long. We have been caught up in theological argument about when life begins, when abortion is direct or indirect and whether if indirect it can be called abortion and so on. We have an acceptance by the Government that abortion may take place in a specific circumstance. That is an advance. I should like the Government to go much further and to respect the health of the woman. I should like them to respect her mental health as much as her physical health, but their amendment refuses to respect her mental health. That is where I disagree with them. It is a silly argument that what the Government are proposing is not abortion and what everybody else is proposing is abortion. The Government are proposing abortion. Let us get away from the nonsense that they are not and let us have a mature debate on how far we should go on that road. That is fundamentally what the debate is about. The Government say we should allow a legal abortion only where there is a substantial physical risk to the life of the mother. I say it should also include a serious and substantial risk to the health of the mother. I would argue also that where a woman or a young girl is pregnant as a [835] result of rape or incest, that would be a serious case for allowing a legal termination of pregnancy. I am not suggesting, as others have claimed that I am, that all a person should have to do is go to a doctor claiming to be suicidal and request an abortion. That is nonsense. What is at issue is whether we accept that there is a medical argument from psychologists. Every Deputy has received a briefing document from the Psychologists' Society of Ireland which goes into some detail in examining existing research. It raises the question in the same terms as the Attorney General's briefing. It is impossible to rule out the possibility that a woman's life may be at risk as a result of suicidal tendencies or in the longer term that her life may be at risk because her health is threatened or damaged by a pregnancy. I am not arguing that the case is made and accepted by everybody that suicide or health grounds are an absolute in terms of requiring a termination of pregnancy, but I object to the attempt to incorporate in our Constitution an absolute statement that under no circumstances will the health of a woman or suicidal tendencies be taken into account. The Attorney General's briefing document states that even though the risk to life may occur in only a limited number of cases, we cannot rule out the possibility of its happening. We cannot rule out that suicide may result from a crisis pregnancy. We cannot rule out that a woman's quality of life may be destroyed as a result of a crisis pregnancy. We should not try to rule out these possibilities in our Constitution. That is why I am proposing the alternative wording in amendment No. 2 which would leave intact Article 40. 3.3º but would qualify it by introducing some compassion. It would extract most of the piety and inject some pity into the whole problem of a woman who may be at risk as a result of pregnancy. I appeal to the Minister to approach this question in those terms rather than try to score political points against me or others by accusing us of wanting abortion on demand.;2628205

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Regarding the saving of her life, all medical and surgical treatment that is necessary must be given, as has been the common medical practice for many years. It is not altered in one iota by the wording of this amendment. Everybody seems to accept that, except for a few chosen ones. I would ask the Deputies to reconsider. It is the fact of the matter that medical attention will be given to pregnant mothers in so far as the protection of their life and health is concerned, just as it is now, except that suicide is being ruled out as a ground for a termination of pregnancy. Some do not want that. I have heard on various sides of the House that they would like to see it included, but we have stated specifically that this is the real thrust of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution. Suicide as a ground for termination of pregnancy will not be included. Article 40. 3.3º is being retained and the right of the unborn is not diminished in any way by this constitutional amendment. The constitutional protection remains undiminished. It is worth remembering that. This is about protection of pregnant mothers and their entitlement to get all medical attention needed for the protection of their health and their lives. It is not just pro-life in so far as the unborn are concerned. It is pro-life in so far as the mother is concerned [885] as well. That is what we are trying to convey in this amendment. I recommend it to the House.;2628207

1523;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;I wish to discuss the amendments in my name which seek to remove the distinction in the Minister's proposed amendment to the Constitution between life and health. I have taken medical and legal advice on this point from people who would be very anxious to restrict abortion and who believe that a termination should only be available in life threatening situations. They nevertheless feel that inserting the words 'as distinct from the health' creates a totally artificial tension between the two concepts, health and life. If the wording were left without the addition of these words, it would obviously remain the case that termination would have to be necessary to save the life of the mother. They do not understand why the provision as to health has to be inserted. Doctors will have to start interpreting this new distinction in the Constitution and will have to look over their shoulders. If they are in an operating theatre, one of the people present might feel that the condition of the mother was health-threatening as distinct from life-threatening and the doctor might feel that he or she could be reported to some authority for giving treatment in those circumstances which would have the effect of terminating the life of the unborn. It is feared that this will introduce a legalistic atmosphere into clinical decisions by doctors in operating theatres and elsewhere. Who will be the losers? The women whose lives will be placed at risk. In view of the increasing incidence of litigation and the costs of medical liability, doctors will tend when there is any doubt to take the most cautious course, which may not be the most efficacious course in regard to saving the life of the mother. While they would be able to argue afterwards that they did things to [837] save the life of the mother they will not have done them as quickly or as effectively as they would have done, if they did not have to look over their shoulders in this way, because of this artificial distinction that is being introduced. By taking out the words 'as distinct from the health' from this amendment one is not saying, although some would argue it, that health alone is a ground, because the words remain 'such termination is necessary to save the life.' I cannot understand why the Minister has taken this course. The argument he advanced in his Second Stage speech is unconvincing. The Minister basically concludes that if we take out the words 'as distinct from the health' we will get an amendment which allows abortion on health grounds alone and that that would lead to abortion on demand. That is not true. There is no basis on which that can be read into the wording. If we take those words out the amendment will still read: It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction. Those words clearly very narrowly circumscribe the circumstances in which a termination can take place. There is no need for the insertion of those words 'as distinct from the health' and all the Minister is doing is putting in the Constitution words that will create the impression that this House and the electorate if they approve of this, are unconcerned about women's health and that we regard this as a lower order concern. I know that will not be the legal meaning of the words, but the fact that those words are put in will create that sort of atmosphere. Let us remember that the Constitution is more than a legal document. It is also a statement of our values as a people. To put in this hairsplitting distinction between life and health in these circumstances shows that we went to enormous trouble to exclude certain possible health threatening conditions [838] from being considered, because we want to make absolutely sure that there will be absolutely no doubt. Given what I understand the Minister wants to achieve, he is not going about it in the right way. The Minister is making a very serious poitical error in including these words, as well as everything else, because he is creating a situation in which many women and doctors will feel they cannot support this amendment because of the words 'as distinct from the health' being included gratuitously and unnecessarily. The Minister in his speech said it is suggested that in any medical condition there is a spectrum of gravity and that it is impossible to identify a precise point at which the risk changes from a risk to health to a risk to life. The Minister went on to say that he did not think this would arise in this case but he did not make any case to demonstrate that point. The Minister attempted to reply to this concern by saying: I think that I can provide reassurance on this point. The intention of the amendment is that a risk to health unrelated to a risk to life is not sufficient to warrant termination of the life of the unborn. It is not the intention of the amendment to affect in any way the degree of probability of risk to life that is necessary to warrant treatment resulting in termination. I do not say it is the intention but the Minister's intention is entirely irrelevant. It is the words that go into the Constitution and how they are interpreted by the Supreme Court perhaps in five or six years time that will count. The Minister and many others had lots of intentions during 1983 and many people outside this house and inside it gave assurances in 1983 as to the meaning of certain words and they made it abundantly clear that it was not the intention to interfere with the right to travel or to prevent the dissemination of information. All these intentions amounted to nothing because the Supreme Court interpreted the words differently. The Minister's language in his speech was extremely tentative where he said 'I [839] think that I can provide reassurance on this point. That is unbecoming modesty on the part of the Minister. The people are entitled to more than that. The Minister attempted to suggest that if the words 'as distinct from the health' were taken out we could have terminations where there was no risk at all to the life of the mother. I cannot understand how the Minister could come to that conclusion when the words of the amendment say that it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of the unborn unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother. The Minister based his case on the Bourne case in England. I do not know if the Minister has read the judgment in that case.;2628209

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;That judgment was given in a criminal case where one cannot necessarily say that the judgment of the judge was the reason the jury came to their conclusion in the case. Mr. Justice McNaughton said on that occasion that if there is a doubt, any doubt as to the motivation of the person concerned, he was entitled to be acquitted. The case the Minister is trying to make is that the Bourne judgment would allow health alone to be a ground for a termination here. The Bourne judgment was uttered in a country where there is no written Constitution and where there is no custom of interpreting the Constitution. To suggest that the Irish Supreme Court might come to a similar conclusion to that in the Bourne judgment if these words were left out is fanciful in the extreme. In charging the jury Mr. Justice McNaughton said: As I told you yesterday and as I tell you today the question that you have got to determine is not whether you are satisfied that he did it in good faith for the purposes of preserving the life of the girl. The question is whether the Crown have proved the negative of that. In other words, that he did not do it in [840] good faith for the purposes of preserving the life of the girl. The important point to draw from that summing up of his judgment by Mr. Justice McNaughton was that the case was about whether the motive was to preserve the life of the girl, not the health. It was the life that was at stake in that case. I do not see how the Minister can draw a conclusion from this that it creates a ground for health alone being the judgment or for drawing any conclusions as to why the Bourne jury came to the decision they came to in that case or as to how that would apply in Ireland. I feel that the Bourne judgment is so ambiguous that it is not helpful and should not have been introduced into this discussion. We should be looking at the words that are in our Constitution as it stands. I mentioned earlier that I would be particularly worried that the clinical decisions by doctors would become the subject of litigation. For example, a midwife involved in an operation might have very strong convictions and might feel that a doctor had acted on grounds of health preservation rather than life preservation, and might seek an injunction to prevent the carrying out of a particular operation. We might have a situation at a later date where a treatment given to save a mother's life which resulted in injury to but not termination of the life of an infant might lead to the infant or persons on his or her behalf suing the doctor who might be claimed to have acted to save the health and not the life of the mother. By introducing this distinction here, these sorts of issues will be contested on the strength of the wording in the Constitution. I do not think that is the Minister's intention but I think it could be the result of this amendment. The Minister should very carefully reconsider the inclusion of those words 'as distinct from the health' in the amendment. I do not believe he has proved to anybody's satisfaction that they are necessary. If he has doubts about the matter he could introduce accompanying legislation to make it very [841] clear what he means by treatment necessary to protect life. There is no need to include the words 'as distinct from the health' in the amendment. If the Minister wanted to achieve some measure of support for his approach he would have done that but it seems he has taken the view that because this is his starting position he is not willing to change or listen to any argument from any quarter. I feel very strongly that the Minister should take out these words 'as distinct from the health'. I do not feel any cause is being served other than causing gratuitous and unnecessary worry and hurt to women by the continued use of those words.;2628213
1528;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;F;Ms. Nuala Fennell;Fine Gael;I appreciate the views of all speakers in this debate, and I did not wish in any way to demean or diminish any other Deputy's contribution. The Minister is deluding himself totally about his support in this House, which he has mentioned frequently. The Progressive Democrats did not support what the Minister was doing. It was a shotgun vote. As far as I am concerned there was not majority support in this House. The majority feeling was against this amendment which is now before us. I regret that the Progressive Democrats decided that this was not an issue on which they could make a stand. We heard the contributions of their two Deputies and we know how they feel about this issue. Therefore, I suggest that the Minister reflect and realise that he does not have a majority in this House for his actions. I make the appeal that we should be laying down principles in our Constitution, that we should not be inserting definitions such as we have discussed here today. This amendment is laden with uncertainty. It will create difficulties for doctors, in hospitals, and it will introduce uncertainties that were not there previously. It will make women fearful and uncertain when they are beginning a pregnancy. I can assure the Minister — and my views on this do not stem from the last letter in The Irish Times or the last television documentary that I have seen — that I am speaking from my experience as a woman and as a mother, and as somebody who has very close contact with the pregnancy culture, I know what women talk about. I know the kind [879] of secret fears they have. I can assure the Minister that the legislation he is railroading through this House will compound that fear and that doubt. I have three children and my daughter will soon give birth to a baby. It is a wonderful experience, but I can assure the Minister I have listened to the doubts and uncertainties that women have expressed. This debate, and the following debate, will make women even more uncertain about their treatment and about the kind of dictates that will be made by their doctors. The Minister should have listened to the views of women. He should have listened to people such as Justice Mella Carroll, who gave the Minister a very detailed brief. He should have listened to Frances Fitzgerald and the people in the Council for the Status of Women. He should have listened to the women TDs in this House. I suggest that I, no more than Deputy McCartan, did not like the snide manner in which the Minister referred to my feelings in this debate. Of course there may have been slight differences among the members of this party, but I am proud to belong to a party that allows us to have these differences. Since I entered the party in 1979 we have been allowed to express views that may be different from the mainstream. Unlike the Minister's party, we are not beaten around the head and told that there is only one viewpoint with which everybody must agree. I support these amendments because I cannot accept the distinction between the health and the life of a woman. The Minister's contribution reads a little like something from a legalistic or moralistic Disneyland, where we are talking about matters which are not quite what they seem, the Minister's own definitions. So far as I am concerned, the life and health of a woman are the same. During my years working and being in close contact with women I have seen many women — some poor and a few with heart complaints — who were worried about their tenth or eleventh pregnancy. Such women would want the freedom to consult their doctors and make the right [880] decisions. I have very little hope that this debate or the debate in the Seanad will change the minds of the Government or the Minister. It seems that these words are written in tablets of stone and it is not possible to change them at this stage. The approach being taken on the health and life of a mother, and excepting suicide, is seriously wrong and I regret it. Acting Chairman: I call the Minister.;2628214

1530;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Tomás Mac Giolla;The Workers' Party;I refrained from intervening earlier because I understood the major debate would take place on the amendments. I am glad you have given me the opportunity of speaking now. Like everybody else, with the exception of Fianna Fáil, we in The Workers' Party also feel that this matter should have been dealt with by legislation. This was the feeling in 1983. A grave error was made in 1983 by putting in a totally unnecessary amendment to ban abortion which was already banned under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. This legislation was in need of amendment and updating, and that is the way this matter should have been dealt with. In those years medical decisions were made by doctors on the basis of protecting patients as they have always done. Even before the 1983 amendment, where a pregnant woman had an illness the doctor recognised that under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, his first responsibility was to his patient, that is, to the woman rather than to the unborn child. The unborn child was of the utmost importance to the doctor and the woman as far as treatment was concerned, but must be secondary to the treatment of the patient for whom the doctor is responsible, that is the woman. Under the Hippocratic Oath doctors [842] must protect the life of their patients. Despite the 1861 Act and the 1983 Amendment of the Constitution, doctors have continued to do that. Article 40. 3.3º only gives equal right to the mother but doctors continued to give prior right to the mother, as they must. The so called pro-life people who forced through the 1983 Amendment with the help of the bishops know this is the case and they agree with it. They said specifically that they do agree with it. They know that the woman is given prior right and yet they forced through an amendment giving her only equal right with the foetus. The medical profession are now in an impossible position where they have neither legislative nor constitutional support or backing for their actions in saving lives. They are the real pro-life people, the only pro-life people in this business. The so-called pro-lifers salve their consciences by pretending that ending the life of the foetus to save the life of the mother is not abortion. That is fine, and nice and cosy for them but where does it leave the doctor? It has no legal standing and therefore the medical profession have no legal protection for their actions. The words in the current constitutional amendment, particularly the words 'as distinct from the health' put doctors in an even more impossible position. They are dedicated to protecting the health of their patients and in many cases they would find it very difficult if not impossible to say that where health is seriously affected the life of the patient is not at risk. How can they say in cases where health is seriously affected that the life is not at risk? This wording will leave doctors even more open to possible court actions either for not taking action to save the woman's health or for taking acton to save the woman's health which endangered or damaged the health or life of the foetus. Whatever wording is decided in this amendment, legislation will still have to be brought forward to put the legislators' interpretation on the constitutional amendment and I think this was made clear by the Supreme Court. When the Taoiseach advised me of the wording [843] being put forward he told me that if the wording were defeated in a refendum he would deal with this by legislation. I was delighted when I heard that and I said as much to him because now there would be a choice. If one did not vote for the referendum there would be legislation. People see that as a big stick held over the pro-lifers perhaps it is but I still think that it is a good idea and hope that this will be explained to voters. The question that must be asked is, where will we stand if the amendment is passed. If there is one lesson that we have learned it is that the wording that will be put before the people should be as simple and as straightforward as possible. That is the reason the amendment in my name has been formulated in simple terms. We have not included the word 'unborn' because it is meaningless — an unborn what? One could not perform an abortion on a cat. Neither have we included the word 'mother' which is equally dodgy and dangerous because it only covers women who already have one or more children. It does not cover women who are not mothers or indeed who may not be mothers following an operation to save their lives. They may then be incapable of having a child. The inclusion of ridiculous words such as 'unborn' and 'mother' leads to the creation of enormous legal difficulties. What I have tried to do on behalf of The Workers' Party is outline the grounds on which it should be lawful to terminate a pregnancy. We make no mention of the word 'unborn' but rather make a positive declaration in which we state that it should be 'lawful to terminate a pregnancy where there is a threat to a woman's life or health and in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest.' That is both simple and clear. No man — and I have spoken to women about this matter — can understand the effect rape or incest has on a woman's mental attitude and feeling about herself. It affects them not only mentally but also physically in that they have a feeling that they are unclean and that their womanhood has been [844] destroyed. No man can understand these feelings and given what I have been told in relation to the effect rape and incest have on some, if not all, women they must have a choice. That is the reason we say the Government should outline the grounds clearly in the amendment because every comma is open to a legal interpretation. However, I presume it is too late to do anything about this matter now, having regard to the fact that two special Cabinet meetings have been held to agree on the wording to be put to the electorate and that we are wasting our time debating the matter. Fianna Fáil have had their wording accepted and they are going to push the Progressive Democrats to come in behind them on it. Even though it may be foolish to propose a wording, our amendment points to where we stand on the issue, and I am strongly of the view that we should be specific. I should point out that even if the wording I have suggested was accepted we would still need legislation which would stipulate the period — say, 12 weeks or 16 weeks — within which it would be unlawful to terminate a pregnancy. Yet, when I asked if the Government's wording is passed would that be the end of the matter, the Taoiseach replied that it would. They are going to leave the matter hanging in mid air again, despite what the Supreme Court had to say, that the legislators had done nothing since 1983 when an amendment which was open to all sorts of interpretations was inserted into the Constitution. No attempt was made to introduce legislation to give effect to that amendment. It is absolutely essential, if the amendment is passed, that legislation be introduced. The Workers' Party will be opposing the amendment mainly on the grounds that this is not the way to proceed. We believe that the matter should be dealt with by way of legislation. We intend to oppose the amendment to ensure that it is dealt with in this way. I am aware that we would then have another battle on our hands as to the legislation that should be introduced by the Government but that is the way we should proceed given [845] that it would be open to any future Government to amend that legislation without the need to hold a referendum.

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;This is unacceptable to the Government and I am quite sure to the vast majority of the people. As I have explained time and again, the Government are not in the business of introducing abortion this is a pro-life [846] amendment. What we are doing is reducing the number of grounds, under the law since the X case, on which a pregnancy may be terminated. What the amendment is seeking to do is to turn that back, and we have consistently said this. It must also be borne in mind — and Deputy De Rossa should appreciate this — that existing medical practice will continue. The Supreme Court test, which has been quoted by Members on all sides of the House since the debate started, is straightforward, and indeed, has already been interpreted by the Supreme Court. Consequently, there is no need at this time to pursue the question of further legislation because the interpretation is already in place. Today, under the law of the land, suicide or self-destruction is a ground on which a pregnancy may be terminated. What we are asking is that this be ruled out. We have been asked why on a number of occasions by Deputies McCartan, De Rossa and others. We have said it is a totally unsatisfactory criterion, that it is uncontrollable and defies regulation. I am advised that there are no scientific means to establish whether a woman is suicidal. In present circumstances the law states, in so far as the Supreme Court judgment is concerned, that termination of pregnancy, abortion, is available here as long as the test is satisfied. One of the grounds for the test is that a pregnant mother is suicidal. We disagree with that and have been stating that quite clearly for some time.;2628225

It is that kind of thing I was bringing to the notice of the House which leads us to believe that there would be those who would seek to use the suicidal element as a means of securing an abortion. It is to stop that possibility that the amendment has been framed in that we believe — and we believe a majority in the House believe — the people do not wish to see suicide as a ground for an abortion.;2628227

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I might refer to amendments Nos. 9 and 10 on which Deputy John Bruton made some comments. Those amendments refer to the deletion of the phrase 'as distinct from the health'. I am opposing those amendments. [848] In proposing them Deputies raised various points. On occasion they referred to the innate offensiveness of the phrase 'as distinct from the health' and claimed that the use of that term also could rule out operations that would be perfectly legal now if they were necessary to save the health as distinct from the life of a woman. While I can well appreciate that there is some strength of feeling in that regard, many of the comments made suggesting that the inclusion of the phrase could have adverse unintended effects are without foundation. It has been suggested that a line cannot be drawn unambiguously between 'life' and 'health' and that this will give rise to difficulties. I have to point out, of course, that the Supreme Court has already drawn that line and had no difficulty in so doing. The essence of the Supreme Court judgment is that such a line must be drawn on the proper interpretation of Article 40. 3.3º. That Article, on its true interpretation, will allow the right to life of the unborn to be superseded only where that is necessary to save the life of the mother, in the sense that otherwise she would die. The Twelfth Amendment would not make any change to the constitutional test on this point, as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court up to now, but rather would establish that interpretation as something which could not be changed at any time in the future without the consent of the people. In addition, in the debate on the Bill, a view was expressed that the test laid down by the Supreme Court cannot be read as including the words 'as distinct from the health'. The fact is that all five members of the Supreme Court spoke specifically in terms of the life of the mother and in no instance was health unrelated to a risk to life contemplated as a ground.;2628238

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;The distinction between the life and health was included in the general test laid down by the Chief Justice, which has been acknowledged by Deputy FitzGerald. It is clear that the distinction was accepted by the other judges and was inherent in what they had to say. It seems that a test of whether action is necessary to save the life of the mother is straightforward and, in practice, should not give rise to difficulty. This test, as laid down, has existed explicitly since the decision was given in the X case. Indeed, prior to the publication of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill I heard no suggestions about any possible difficulties in the operation of that test. I agree it has arisen since we came in here but, before that, there had been no reference, no complaints, no difficulties suggested that might exist in so far as the application of the test was concerned.;2628246

1562;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I accept that. Indeed the phrase reflects the Supreme Court decision in so far as it provides that the risk must be to the life of the mother in the sense that, unless the risk is avoided, she would die. The phrase is taken from the Chief Justice's judgment but it is clear that the other judges also had in mind a risk to life rather than a risk to health. The reality which we cannot ignore is that in other jurisdictions a risk of damage to health is the ground which has led to widescale abortion on demand nobody [850] is denying that. It was in order to prevent such circumstances developing here that the phrase has been included in the amendment. Some doctors have expressed concern that the inclusion of the phrase could have the effect of restricting a certain flexibility which, under current medical, practice, doctors are permitted to exercise in the best interests of their patients. It is suggested that in any medical condition there is a spectrum of gravity, to which Deputy Bruton quite rightly referred. It is impossible to identify a precise point at which the risk changes from a risk to health to a risk of life. The concern of the doctors involved seemed to be that the wording may result in their being forced to have a greater degree of certainly about the risk to the mother's life before providing treatment which may result in the loss of the foetus, whereas normal medical practice cannot operate on the basis of certainty but rather on the basis of probability only. That is the key phrase. When I used the words before 'I think'— of which Deputy Bruton reminded me — the manner in which I used them was by way of reassuring Members. It is a mode of language the meaning of which is well known to Deputy Bruton. It is not the intention of the amendment to affect in any way the degree of probability of risk to life that is necessary to warrant treatment resulting in termination. In the X case the Supreme Court laid down the test as being a real and substantial risk to the mother's life arising as a matter of probability. There is nothing in the proposed wording that would change that. I want to allay fears, expressed by some, that the use of the words 'as distinct from the health' in the amendment might result in pregnant women being denied necessary medical treatment to protect their health. There is no basis for that fear and people should not express that fear.;2628248

Current medical practice in this regard will not be affected. Under current medical practice the question of termination of pregnancy arises only where there is a threat to the mother's life. After all the amendment does no more than adopt the test laid down in this regard by the Supreme Court in the X case. There has been no suggestion that medical practice regarding necessary treatment to protect woman's health has been affected in any way since that decision. The suggestion that the words 'as distinct from the health' should be omitted from the proposed amendment really boils down to this, that it should be possible to terminate the life of an unborn child where there is no risk to the life of the mother. Let there be no doubt about that. The amendment as it stands will allow all necessary treatment to be provided for an expectant mother in all circumstances where her life is at risk even if that would result in the loss of the life of her unborn child.;2628250

However, the words 'as distinct from the health' formed part of the test enunciated by the Chief Justice in that case. If those words were to be omitted now from a constitutional provision which reproduces the essence of that test, significance might well be read into that omission. In a future hard case health unrelated to a life-threatening condition, might be found to be a good ground for abortion, as happened in another jurisdiction, the result of which we are all familiar with.;2628254

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;I shall be as brief as possible. Like Deputy Fennell, I appreciate the concern, anger and outrage which has been expressed by men and women during this debate about the proposed wording. I am glad to say that these feelings are shared by people outside this Chamber, particularly by fathers and men who care about the life and health of their wives. These men recognise that childbirth cannot be taken for granted and that it is a time of high anxiety. The Minister referred to the popular and warm approval given to this wording by the majority of people outside this House. He is either totally out of touch or he has not spoken to the majority of the people who believe otherwise. Like my colleagues, I believe the word 'protect' should be included instead of 'save'. The word 'protect' is affirming [881] ative and signifies life. Every pregnant woman needs to know that she will be protected in every way possible. The word 'save' is stark and is regarded by women as life threatening. I do not know if the Minister is aware of the enormous difference between those two words and the fear 'save' can engender. I wish to refer to a point which needs to be pinned down here. The Minister said: If there were to be only one case in one million, or even ten or more million, we would have to take account of it. There is a duty on all of us to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken. I welcome that affirmation but unfortunately it cannot be guaranteed by the wording in the substantive issue. My colleagues have referred to health and quality of life. As we know, women have been worn out, have become invalids, had their lives shortened and their quality of life destroyed as a result of a pregnancy and the health problems which can arise from childbirth. These problems may not be life threatening but they are life shortening and can destroy the quality of life not only of the woman but also of her husband and children. Consideration has to be given to the necessity for a good quality of life. Hopefully it will be recognised that a healthy and protected mother is the most positive unit in our society. The emotional and mental well being of a mother has a ripple effect not alone on her family but on the community as a whole. Everyone in this House knows that if women avail of the opportunities they get to enhance their lives this too will have a ripple effect on society. Above everything else, I am astonished that the mental, emotional and psychological health of women is being excluded. It is already legally accepted that women suffering from post-natal or pre-natal depression cannot be held responsible for any crimes they commit. How can the Government say that [882] mental, emotional and psychological problems are not life threatening? It has been legally established that a woman suffering from pre-natal or post-natal depression is of disturbed mind. As Deputy Fennell said, there is a feeling among the Government that they consulted with everybody who needed to be consulted. I wish to state clearly in this House that neither women nor their representatives were listened to. The Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Council for the Status of Women, the Society of Psychologists of Ireland and 13 gynaecologist obstetricians from Cork, Dublin, Donegal, Kerry, Portlaoise, Wexford, Galway and Limerick were not listened to. The Minister may feel that he has listened and learned, but I wish to point out that women have an inbuilt disgust at this wording and feel they will have no control. I am referring in particular to cases involving rape and incest where a young girl or woman will not be able to terminate a pregnancy. We all recognise that rape and incest represent domination and control and that they destroy people's lives. This violence should not be compounded by more domination and control where a woman is told she has no choice about terminating her pregnancy. This represents an invasion of the integrity of all women. Other Catholic countries and countries which care deeply about life have introduced legislation and, where necessary, constitutional amendments which dignified and valued women and did not sideline, marginalise and frighten them as this wording does.;2628264

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;In fairness to Deputy Fennell, I hope she will have an opportunity to contribute. I would point out to the Deputy that I sat here for most of the day without contributing. I did not contribute to section 1 until people badgered me into doing so. As I said, I am very happy to contribute, and this is my first contribution since the first vote was taken. I have no problem in allowing all Deputies to make Second Stage speeches again on all these issues, but I do not want anybody to say that I did not respond to them. For that reason I am taking a little extra time, but I promise to be as quick as I can. I was pleased to hear Deputy Mac Giolla's comment that he understands the reason the Government say that if the amendment is not endorsed on 3 December there will be need for legislation. While others may think that is some kind of threat, that is not the intention but it is the reasonable thing to do. Deputy Mac Giolla summed up the matter neatly when he asked what else would one do. I would take issue with Deputy Mac Giolla in that he saw no reference to 'mother'. This is one of the points raised by many people but they seem to forget that what is involved is not 55 words, as was continually referred to by Deputy Bruton, but 133 words, the number of words in Article 40. 3.3º together with the 55 words — I take for granted Deputy Bruton's numerical ability on that matter.;2628281

1606;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I was only making the point that the party leaders agreed that there would be a referendum on travel and information and that the substantive issue would be dealt with by a referendum and/or legislation in the autumn. The Government have honoured that commitment, which people should recognise. I should like to discuss amendments Nos. 3 and 12 as they are being taken with amendment No. 2. They deal with existing medical practice. Doctors may feel that, in some way, the inclusion of [857] the phrase 'as distinct from the health' in the Government amendment will inhibit them from acting until there is a degree of certainty in relation to the existence of a risk to life, which would be wholly impracticable in medical practice and which can only proceed on the basis of probability. I have explained previously to the House that the Supreme Court decision requires only that the existence of a real and substantial risk to life be established on the balance of probabilities — there is nothing in the amendment which would change that. The phrase 'necessary to save the life' does not mean that the risk to life must be imminent or immediate before action to terminate the pregnancy will be permitted. In this context cases of cardiac conditions or treatment involving chemotherapy in the early stages of pregnancy are mentioned the test enunciated by the Supreme Court does not require that the risk to life must be immediate. The court specifically rejected that proposition, neither does the wording of the proposed amendment require that the risk to life should be immediate. I am advised that the phrase 'necessary to save the life' means that the pregnancy could be terminated if the doctors were able to form the view that, even after childbirth and recovery of the mother, other treatment, for whatever condition from which she was suffering, would be ineffective to protect her life. There have been suggestions that the Bill will render unlawful medical treatment for mothers where that treatment is for the benefit of their health as opposed to saving their lives. The Bill is not changing the law in this respect, it adopts the existing law as set out by the Supreme Court and nobody has ever suggested, as far as I know, that the Supreme Court decision has given rise to the consequences which it is now claimed would flow from the amendment. My understanding of current medical practice is that medical treatment for a health condition which is not life threatening is not permitted if the foreseen result of that treatment is the death of the feotus but that medical treatment is permitted [858] where the life of the mother is at risk and the loss of life of the foetus from such treatment is foreseen. It may, of course, also occasionally happen that a drug or other therapy given for some condition causes an entirely unforeseen adverse response and leads to the loss of life of the foetus. I am advised that the wording proposed could not be held to imply a breach of the law in circumstances where the life of the foetus is lost as an unforeseen and unintended consequence of treatment carried out in good faith.;2628292

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;Matters like this raised in the debate have implications not only for the general public but for the medical profession. It is clear that medical care of women and the provision of that care when life is at risk should remain to the fore of the debate. The medical profession are called upon to deal with issues of life and death with the complex legal and treatment considerations of patients under their care. Individual doctors will be at the forefront of the decision making process implicit in the issues raised by the referendum on the substantive issue. It is not the referendum which brings this about, it is a fact of medical life. Every day the medical profession provide expert medical and surgical care for pregnant women regardless of the medical complexities, rarity of diagnosis or the trauma which, in exceptional individual cases, may arise. It is necessary to reassure people generally — and women in particular — that that caring and expertise will remain fully available in our health services, regardless of the outcome of the referenda. It should be stressed that such treatment and care have been the hallmark of our health services for many years. It should be clearly acknowledged that the medical profession are obviously to the fore in deciding on matters that are the essence of life and death.;2628294

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Pádraig Flynn;Fianna Fáil;It should be clearly acknowledged that the medical profession are obviously to the fore in deciding matters which are the essence of life and death and that reliance on the profession has been well placed as evidenced by the high national — and international — reputation of our obstretric and by gynaecological services in particular. This faith is clearly shared by the general public and must be safeguarded at all costs during the referenda debate. That is an important element. This has been a major element of the contribution to the debate of the Minister for Health in the House and outside it. I know my contribution was long but, in fairness to those who made decent contributions in the House, the least I could do was to acknowledge that and [860] respond in kind by giving a good, clear outline in as precise terms as possible.;2628303
1618;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;I have listened carefully to the Minister during all stages of this debate and indeed prior to the Second Stage debate. Will he admit that he might be wrong this time as well? The Minister prefaced his remarks by saying he was 'advised'. Needless to say, he is being advised by a broad range of people on this occasion but I am sure he was also advised in 1983 when he got it miserably wrong. The people at least deserve an apology in that respect because of what the Minister said throughout that debate. Indeed, I questioned his motives on that occasion. The Minister referred to the medical profession with all due respect, he is doing a great disservice to the medical profession and if he had the respect for them which he claims to have he would not go about the amendment in this way because he will cause more problems for the medical profession. Problems were caused by the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach in their first attempts to explain what the Minister for Justice was trying to do, consequently confusion was rampant. The Minister will not allay the fears expressed by myself and others that certain medical treatments which are available at present will not be available after the amendment is passed — if it is passed, which is doubtful. There might have been some possibility of allaying those fears if legislation had been enacted. I am at a loss to understand, after the Minister's last contribution, why the Government are reluctant to introduce legislation now that it is an option. However, the Minister will introduce it without any difficulty if he is defeated on 3 December. If it does not cause any problems to introduce it the second time round, why not do it properly and try to avoid some of the consequences of the awful mess we got into since 1983? Judging by the conduct of the Taoiseach in Dublin Castle today, it appears that we are looking down the barrel of a gun in relation to a general election and [861] I hope that courageous people will hold on to their nerve in the face of that election because, if we find ourselves on platforms within a matter of weeks, I trust the Minister for Justice will still stick to some aspects of his Second Stage speech which are a major advance on his previously adopted position. In that speech he said: 'under the amendment, where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is in danger if the pregnancy continues, the pregnancy may be lawfully terminated if that is necessary to save her life'. I trust that the Minister for Health will explain that sentence to many of his colleagues, male and female, who supported him on Thursday last because, if a general election is declared, as seems likely, and if Cabinet confidentiality and collective responsibility mean anything, then I suspect that many of the Minister's——;2628304

Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;The Minister may want to read the newspapers.

1622;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;That is something the Minister can catch up on. I trust that Government Deputies will stick to the sentence I have just read out, from the Minister's Second Stage speech because from comments I have read in the press today it would appear that some of them neither understand it nor want to understand it and certainly do not want to support it. That sentence results from the advice of the Attorney General or at least that part of his advice that the Minister obviously accepted. Unfortunately, as was demonstrated when the Minister set out to explain the words in the context of the amendments put down in my name and in the name of Deputy Howlin, practically [862] every word in the Minister's amendment to the Constitution is loaded with potential meaning. We might have had some opportunity to clarify the meaning if we were dealing with legislation. One thing is obvious: the statements of Government intent, even if they were clear and not as confused as they have been, are meaningless because it will be the Supreme Court who will again in due course — I would say it will not take another ten years, because I am sure these words will be tested before then — who will be asked to interpret the meaning of the amendment. The words and phrases that I do not think the Committee will have resolved by 6. 45 p. m. this evening are, 'necessary', 'save', 'as distinct from the health', 'disorder', and 'not being a risk of self-destruction'. The potential meaning and the consequence of each of those both individually and taken together will, I believe, place many women at risk. I have not heard anything in the House this afternoon to allay those fears. The use of the term 'save the life', could, as I said in my Second Stage contribution be much better phrased as 'protect the life'. Somebody's life could be protected from the probability of a medical emergency in the future as opposed to protecting somebody's life from the consequences of that emergency, a distinction the Minister seems to have difficulty in accepting. Apart altogether from the offensiveness of the term 'as distinct from the health' in its implying that the health of women is not an area of concern to the Members of the House, and that what we are having is a reflection of a debate that took place in this country about 40 years ago——;2628308

1626;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Dick Spring;The Labour Party;On 3 December the women of Ireland will demonstrate that they consider the wording to be an insult to their health. If the Minister has the opportunity to reply to this debate, perhaps he will say on what basis he was advised — he used the words 'I am advised'— in relation to the operations which we believe may be ruled out as a result of the use of the term 'as distinct from the health', operations that would be perfectly legal now if they were necessary to save the health as distinct from the life of a woman. Could the Minister give examples to which that advice relates? I think it is only if we have the concrete examples that we can know what we are talking about. The phrase 'is necessary to save the life', as distinct from saving the health, of the mother is also a matter of concern. After the Minister's previous contribution, I foresee that there will be grey areas and these areas will have to be dealt with by the medical profession when it is our responsibility to clarify what is meant. The use of the word 'disorder' does not include psychological and psychiatric disorders. Reference to that word in the explanatory memorandum circulated by the Government states that it is necessary to include ectopic pregnancies but it is unfortunate that it rules out — and the Minister persists in this exclusion — all forms of psychological and psychiatric disorders. I believe that to be an absolute insult to the advances that have been made in those areas of medicine in the past years. Again, that is an element the Government will have to examine. The unfortunate aspect is that the Minister seems to have made up his mind. I consider the Taoiseach's manner in offering the people this amendment which the majority of Members in the House consider to be unsatisfactory, and the manner in which he referred to legislation, [864] to be a threat to the Irish people. What the Taoiseach is saying is that we can deal with absolutes in an extremely complex area. This is not a black and white issue. Unfortunately, we will not have the matter ironed out. The medical profession will carry the brunt of the lack of responsibility shown in this House on this occasion and, unfortunately, whether we like it or not, we will be back in the House legislating one way or the other within a very short period.;2628312
1627;An Bille um an D&oacute u Leas&uacute D&eacute ag ar an mBunreacht, 1992: C&eacute im an Choiste agus na C&eacute imeanna Deiridh. Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992: Committee and Final Stages.;27.10.92;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;This is not an interpretation. Obviously we are raising an issue that is of real concern to the Minister for Health because this is not some esoteric interpretation of these events that is confined to this side of the House. I should like to refer to one passage only from the speech by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley — a passage to which I did not refer earlier — which states: Another major concern about the proposed Amendment wording is the distinction to be drawn in the Constitution between 'life' and 'health'. This could take away from doctors, from the courts and from this House any right to deal with those hard cases which will arise. No one can really know whether a pregnancy which will, as a matter of probability, drastically shorten and devastate a woman's life, be permitted to be terminated under this proposal. It seems to me that the wording is calculated to try to distinguish between life shortening and life threatening pregnancies and to exclude completely 'life-shortening' risks as a ground for termination. That was said by a Minister who was privy to the advice of the Attorney General and who, presumably, participated in the Cabinet sub-committee. Unfortunately, [871] he is absent from today's debate. It is worth repeating, that the Progressive Democrats were founded on the basis of standing by the Republic on this issue it seems to me they are bystanders in the Republic. This is a serious issue about the health of women and how we can predict this amendment will work out in practice. I do not pretend to have the foresight or prophetic vision the Minister has and say categorically that a particular interpretation of the workings of this amendment in practice or by the Supreme Court will happen. However, this amendment, like the 1983 amendment, is open to a variety of possible interpretations and because of its ambiguity one of its impacts could be to place the life of women at risk. I say this on surer footing than the Minister is on, in that, unfortunately, things I said in 1983 have come to pass. Queries I raised about the wording in 1983 have been proved correct. Practically everything the Minister said about the 1983 wording has been proved to be utterly and completely wrong. I regret we are dealing with this issue in this way today. Originally when the Taoiseach talked about the possibility of consensus certainly within the Fine Gael Party there was a hope that we would be involved in a genuine discussion and exchange of views to see whether this issue could be tackled in a way which would allow for a consensus to be reached. The Taoiseach's version of a consensus is simply that he puts up a proposal which everyone else must accept and there is no suggestion of taking on board genuine concerns from people——;2628313

I move: 'That the Bill be now read a Second Time.' This Bill provides for constitutional and legislative reform in relation to the protection of [20] human life in pregnancy. This proposal, which represents the first legislative response to the legal issues which remain unresolved since the X case in 1992, represents a fair, reasonable and compassionate approach. Abortion is a sensitive issue for society and it is heartening that the response to the proposals to date has been of a measured, mature and thoughtful nature without, thankfully, the rancour that characterised the debates in 1983 and 1992. It is very important to acknowledge that laws alone cannot deal adequately with the often tragic realities of crisis pregnancy in modern society. On more than 6,500 occasions in the past year alone, women giving an Irish address have had abortions in Britain. That is about 18 women every single day of the year and many Irish women have made this journey in previous years also. The difficult situations faced by these women and the often lonely decisions they have made demand a sensitive, understanding and compassionate response from us all. We must, by every reasonable means at our disposal, strive to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy. Law is only part of the picture. Education, advice, care and compassion are in many ways much more important. That is why a comprehensive approach is being adopted on three different levels: constitutional, legislative and caring, practical, intervention. I accept that the proposals to address the constitutional and legislative issues will have little, if any, impact on the situation of those Irish women who choose to travel abroad for abortions. I also acknowledge that a comprehensive range of compassionate, supportive and non-judgmental services is vital in order to provide women with the supports they need to deal with a crisis pregnancy and to make decisions about the options open to them. It is for these reasons that, having considered the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, I have established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency which will have the task, in consultation with Government and other statutory and non-statutory agencies, of drawing up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and oversee its implementation. I have appointed Ms Olive Braiden, who has a distinguished record in the fields of human rights and women's health issues, as chairperson of the agency and I am in the process of appointing the management board. Initial staff have already been seconded from my Department to enable the agency to become operational. The Government is providing funding of 6. 5 million for the agency in 2002. The prevention of crisis pregnancy in the first instance will be a primary task of the agency. Preventative issues concerning education of young people and adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles, will be addressed. Much concern has been expressed about the need to make women more aware of their options should they have a crisis pregnancy, and to enable [21] them to consider these carefully and to assist them before they make decisions about the course of action they want to take. This is another major area to be addressed. Women who have had an abortion, either recently or some time ago, have particular needs also and this is another area which the agency will be asked to address. We need to ensure that they are treated with compassion and understanding and that both their emotional and physical health needs are attended to. The establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will play a major role in the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services. The Government hopes that over time it will be possible to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among Irish women and ensure that women who find themselves in this situation will have available to them the widest possible range of assistance to help them deal with their situation. I will now set out briefly the constitutional and legal background to the proposals in the Bill. In 1983 the people decided by referendum to insert into the Constitution Article 40. 3.3, which declares: the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. No laws were ever enacted on foot of this amendment and the provisions in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 remained the basic law in relation to abortion. This left open the possibility that Article 40. 3.3 would have to be interpreted by the courts as apart from the 1861 Act there was no legislation which made clear what was and was not permissible under the law should there be a potential conflict between the right to life of the mother and that of the unborn. As Members will be well aware, subsequent to the insertion of Article 40. 3.3, cases have arisen in the course of which the substantive issue of abortion has been considered by the courts. The general circumstances of these cases will be well known to Members and do not require reiteration. In the X case of 1992, a majority of the members of the Supreme Court held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, and that this real and substantial risk could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful. The stated risk to the mother's life in this case arose because she had threatened to commit suicide if she had to continue with the pregnancy. Some of the dicta of the majority in the Supreme Court also indicated that the constitutional right to travel could be restrained to prevent an abortion taking place in circumstances where there was no threat to the life of the mother. The right to travel did not take pre[22] cedence over the right to life. In November 1992, constitutional amendments were proposed to deal with different aspects of the X case judgment. On the substantive issue, the wording put forward by the Government was intended to recognise that there could be circumstances where, in order to protect the life of a pregnant woman, medical intervention was necessary which could result in the death of the unborn child but that these circumstances did not include the risk of suicide. The people rejected this amendment. In the C case of 1997, the High Court accepted that where evidence had been given to the effect that the pregnant young woman involved might commit suicide unless allowed to terminate her pregnancy, there was a real and substantial risk to her life and such termination was, therefore, a permissible medical treatment of her condition where this was the only means of avoiding such a risk. Mr. Justice Geoghegan also made remarks obiter dicta about the issue of travel. He believed that a court, in considering the welfare of an Irish child in Ireland and considering whether on health grounds a termination of pregnancy was necessary, must be confined to considering the grounds for termination which would be lawful under the Irish Constitution and could not make a direction authorising travel to another jurisdiction for a different kind of abortion. The amended Constitution did not, he said, now confer a right to abortion outside of Ireland. It merely prevents injunctions against travelling for that purpose. There has been a view that, arising from the judgment in the X case and subsequently the C case, there is 'unfinished business' requiring a response in terms of constitutional or legislative change, or both. In the light of the difficulties which have surrounded previous efforts to address the issues to which I have referred, the Government has devoted considerable effort to facilitating and informing public debate about them. The Bill I am bringing before the House today represents the latest step in this process. We have engaged in a careful and logical process designed to explore the issues, to enable the many people and organisations who wish to express their views on the protection of pregnant women and of unborn human life in pregnancy to be heard and to consider ways of moving forward which will, we hope, command the support of the people. While it may never be possible to satisfy every point of view or to devise a solution acceptable to all, the Government has sought, by fostering a reasonable, calm and structured national debate, to develop a consensus on how the issues arising from the X and C case judgments might finally be resolved. In the first instance the Government decided in 1997 that a Green Paper on abortion would be prepared. This document was published in September 1999 and was welcomed by many interests as a clear and balanced document, setting out as [23] it did the history of the issues and the different arguments advanced and discussing the principal constitutional and legislative options. The Government referred the Green Paper to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, for consideration. The all-party committee embarked on a detailed process of consultation, first seeking submissions on the options discussed in the Green Paper. Over 100,000 submissions were received from individuals and organisations. Subsequently, the committee held hearings at which the issues were explored in detail with many of those who had made submissions, including representatives of the medical profession and of the churches, attending. The all-party committee's proceedings and report, published in November 2000, were generally agreed to be fair, balanced and of great value in educating and forming public and political opinion. The Government has carefully examined the different proposals put forward by the all-party committee and the approach being adopted is based on one of the three possible approaches identified by the committee. Stated briefly, it will protect best medical practice while providing for a legislative prohibition on abortion and underpinning such legislation with an amendment to the Constitution. The Government is satisfied on the basis of all the expert medical evidence presented and discussed that there are life-threatening conditions or illnesses, either associated with pregnancy or exacerbated by pregnancy, in which in order to save the woman's life it may be necessary for doctors to consider taking action in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended. The Government does not believe that a risk of suicide is a valid basis on which to provide for medical intervention. The experience in the 1992 referendum attests to the difficulty of providing in a relatively short constitutional provision for a clear prohibition on abortion, while ensuring that there is no obstacle to pregnant women receiving all the care and treatment they need. The Government has concluded that there is no simple sentence or paragraph that can be inserted into the Constitution which, by itself, would amount to a balanced, effective, legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy. Instead the Government has decided that the proper place to strike that complex balance is in legislation, not in the Constitution. The proposals contained in the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act provide a practical legislative response to the issues raised by the 1983 amendment and by the 'X' and 'C' cases. They will not satisfy the wishes of those at different ends of the spectrum. The proposals are aimed at achieving a reasonable compromise which will enjoy the support of the middle ground of opinion and, I hope, be seen by the other groups as an honest and genuine attempt to pro[24] vide an acceptable and workable solution to this complex issue. It has been suggested that to do nothing in relation to abortion is still the best option. However, in the Government's view, the terms of Article 40. 3.3 and the Courts' interpretation of that Article demand a legislative response from the Oireachtas. Indeed in 1992 one judge of the Supreme Court criticised the Oireachtas for its lack of action in this regard. At present the only real defence against widespread use of the X case as a basis for 'social abortion' in Ireland is the ethical consensus in the medical profession. It must be remembered, however, that those outside the medical profession are not subject to that ethical code and with, for example, the development of drugs which can bring about an abortion without medical intervention, the current protections afforded to the unborn cannot be regarded as adequate. Others have argued for legislation without further constitutional change or underpinning. However, the outcome of the X case does not afford a satisfactory starting point for future legislation. To legislate for the decision in the X case and, in particular, to make complex legal provision and control for the suicide risk as a ground for abortion, could open the way to freely available 'social abortion' in Ireland. The Government, having considered all the options, is opposed to permitting any intervention which could or would result in the death of the unborn child other than where the mother's life is at risk from a medical condition, excluding a risk of suicide. I believe a majority of Irish people are opposed to any lessening of the protection currently afforded to the unborn and I have no doubt that any proposal to remove Article 40. 3.3 from the Constitution, which would be necessary if it were proposed to legalise abortion, would fail. The purpose of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill is to provide a secure and effective constitutional basis for a legislative approach to the protection of human life in pregnancy. The proposals are designed to ensure that women can continue to receive all necessary medical treatment during pregnancy, while at the same time ensuring maximum protection of the unborn and maintaining a clear prohibition on abortion. The mechanism proposed is that a referendum will be held to approve the insertion into Article 46 of the Constitution of the text of proposed amendments to Article 40. 3 of the Constitution. These are (i) a new subsection 4º in Article 40. 3 to provide that the life of the unborn in the womb will be protected in accordance with the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002 and (ii) a new subsection 5º in Article 40. 3 to provide that any future proposal to amend or repeal the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002 will have to be approved by the people in a referendum. [25] If the people accept the proposal, the amendments to Article 40. 3 will have effect only if a law containing the text of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act is enacted by the Oireachtas within a period of 180 days, otherwise the amendment in its entirety is nullified. The mechanism of making a constitutional amendment conditional on a later legal development was successfully used in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The proposed constitutional changes on this occasion are designed to ensure that the legislation has a sound constitutional basis, that the careful balance it strikes will not be subject to legal challenge from either side of the argument and to give people the reassurance that they will be consulted if change is proposed in the future. It has been suggested that because Article 46. 4 of the Constitution states that a proposal for a constitutional amendment shall not contain another proposal, the mechanism being used is not valid. Any such assertion is incorrect and is based on a misunderstanding of Article 46. 4 of the Constitution. There is only one proposal in the Bill to amend the Constitution, namely, to insert into the Constitution the text set out in the First Schedule. The text of an envisaged criminal statute, as set out in the Second Schedule, is not a proposal within the meaning of Article 46. 4 of the Constitution. The Bill to amend the Constitution does not propose that the Schedule containing the envisaged legislation should in itself have any legal effect. A 'Yes' vote in the referendum on the Bill to amend the Constitution will give effect only to the constitutional amendments involved. The only way in which the terms of the legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy can become law or have any effect is through a separate, subsequent decision by the Oireachtas to enact another Bill. It is precisely because it is not possible to propose a criminal law and a constitutional law in the same Bill that the present amendment was drafted as it is. It was drafted deliberately to avoid containing two proposals, and it does not contain two proposals. The legislation, the text of which is set out in the Second Schedule, is not being enacted at this stage all that people are voting for is to accommodate that legislation in the Constitution if the Oireachtas, at a later stage, passes it into law. It has been claimed that the current proposal is in effect the same as that of 1992 and questions have been asked as to why it should be acceptable to the people now, when they rejected it in 1992. In 1992, the people voted on the proposed wording of the constitutional change itself, but not on the legislation which would have followed had the amendment been passed. On this occasion the Government is committed to allowing the people to decide not only on the principle but also on the detail of what is proposed. They have a right to be consulted on the fundamental issues involved in the abortion issue, [26] and the amendment process set out in this Bill recognises that fundamental right. The legislation envisaged has been published and will have been debated before the referendum so that the electorate know exactly what is proposed. The legislative mechanism, as I explained earlier, allows for a balanced, effective, legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround protection of human life in pregnancy. Such a complex balance can be struck in legislation in a way that is not possible if purely a constitutional approach were taken. At the same time, the constitutional 'lock' which will be placed on the legislation guarantees that it cannot be altered by the Oireachtas without another referendum. Furthermore, there has been a detailed process of examination of the issues and their complexities involving many submissions from interested parties and, in particular, the all-party committee's hearings during which many medical and other experts gave evidence. In many significant respects, therefore, what is proposed on this occasion represents a much more detailed approach following on from a careful process of consideration and debate. I will now turn to the detail of the proposals. The Bill provides for the operation of a mechanism whereby proposed changes to Article 40. 3 of the Constitution and the text of envisaged legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy will be put to the people in a referendum. Section 1 provides for the amendment of Article 46 of the Constitution so that the text of the First Schedule to the Act will be inserted after the existing section 5 of that Article. Section 2 is a straightforward citation provision dealing with the proposed amendment of the Constitution. The First Schedule contains the proposed text of the amendment of Article 46 of the Constitution. The proposed text to be inserted as Article 46. 6.1 in turn contains the proposed text of Articles 40. 3.4 and 40. 3.5 of the Constitution. The text proposed as Article 40. 3.4 provides that, in particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002. The use of the term 'in particular' makes it clear that the statute envisaged by the amendment, if enacted, is not intended to be a restatement or redefinition of the term 'unborn' as used in Article 40. 3.3. The effect of the text proposed as Article 40. 3.5 is that any Bill containing provisions to amend the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, must be referred to the people in a further referendum. The existing Article 40. 3.3, as amended in 1992, will remain also. The effect of the text proposed as Article 46. 6.2 is that if the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, is enacted and amendments are made to Article 40, the amendments to Article 46 will no longer appear in the official text of the Constitution and the amendments made to [27] Article 40 will take effect, appearing in the appropriate place within that Article. This is because, once the amendments to Article 40. 3 take place, it would be undesirable for the new Article 40. 3 to appear in more than one place in the Constitution, that is, in Article 46 as was as in Article 40. The text proposed as Article 46. 6.3 contains a mechanism whereby, unless within 180 days a law is enacted in exactly the terms of the text seen and approved by the people when they vote on the proposed amendment, the whole of Article 46. 6 will cease to have effect and the Constitution will revert to the form in which it existed before the referendum. The text on which the people will vote will be that agreed by the Oireachtas in the course of the passage of the present Bill. The fact that the text of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act is contained in a Schedule to the Bill does not curtail the right of the Oireachtas to discuss it and to propose amendments during the passage of the present Bill, in the same way as happens with any other legislation. It must be understood, however, that when following the referendum, the Oireachtas comes to enact the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, it will not be able to amend the Bill for that legislation in any way. The new law, when enacted by the Oireachtas, will not become a formal part of or be written into the Constitution. Its terms will simply have constitutional protection and recognition. It will be open to subsequent amendment like any law but only if the people approve the amending legislation. The text proposed as Article 46. 6.4 states that the Bill for the law on the protection of human life in pregnancy is excluded from the terms of Articles 26 and 27 of the Constitution because if the people in a referendum decide that the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, should be enacted, it would be inappropriate that this legislation should nonetheless later be subject to the provisions of these articles and the mechanisms they provide for reference of Bills to the Supreme Court and to the people respectively. The Second Schedule to the Bill contains the text of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act. Irish maternity services have a deservedly high reputation when it comes to both the care of pregnant women and their unborn children. The Government wants to put in place for the first time a legislative framework which will ensure that there are no legal doubts surrounding the provision of medial care during pregnancy. This Act will make clear what is and is not legally permissible by way of medical intervention during pregnancy. That is the first legislative approach in this area. The lives of women will be protected during pregnancy and the developing human life within the mother's womb will also be protected. [28] The Act will also remove any doubt there may be about the legality of treatment which doctors may consider necessary where some women during pregnancy are suffering from certain rare life-threatening medical conditions. It will provide certainty for doctors who may have feared that some interventions, although accepted medical practice in such situations, might nonetheless be unlawful. Section 1 defines abortion for the purposes of the Act as 'the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman'. It provides exemption from the definition of abortion of a medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved place, in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is terminated where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent the real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction. In the course of the hearing of medical evidence by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, it became clear that in a small number of cases of strict and undeniable medical necessity, intervention by doctors to safeguard the mother's life can entail or result in the ending of the life of the unborn. On reading the testimony to the all-party committee, it becomes apparent that while there are differences of language and of interpretation among members of the medical profession, their approach to the care of pregnant women and their unborn children is essentially the same, that is, their objective in all cases is to ensure that women receive all the medical care they may need and that the health of their unborn children is afforded the maximum protection also. There can be no doubt that in rare situations, in order to save a woman's life it may be necessary to intervene in a way that results in the death of the unborn child. These situations are very rare but they can and do occur. Dr. Peter McKenna, Master of the Rotunda Hospital, told the all-party committee that 'possibly once a year a woman would be seen in this country who, if her pregnancy is not terminated within a matter of probably hours or days, will die from a complication'. It is also apparent from the evidence to the committee that many doctors would not consider that such a procedure constitutes abortion. Professor John Bonnar, Chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, stated: It would never cross an obstetrician's mind that intervening in a case of pre-eclampsia, cancer of the cervix or ectopic pregnancy is abortion. They are not abortion as far as the professional is concerned, these are medical treatments that are essential to protect the life of the mother. The new law will, therefore, define 'abortion' in a way that clearly excludes such ethically legitimate procedures from being termed an abortion for the purposes of our criminal law. Doctors may [29] provide any medical treatment which, in their opinion, is necessary to safeguard the life of a pregnant woman. The doctor's opinion must be formed in good faith and there is an explicit requirement that regard be had to the need to preserve unborn human life, where practicable. It is important to emphasise that doctors, when treating a pregnant woman, make every effort to safeguard not only her life, but that of her baby. This will not change after the passage of the Act. The question of threatened suicide in pregnancy is of concern to many people. Threatened suicide during pregnancy was a central issue in the X case and the C case, to which I have already referred. The effect of the proposed Act will be that a threat of suicide will no longer be a ground for legal abortion in the State. I know this is a difficult issue for many people and that there are those who believe it is appropriate and feasible to legislate to permit abortion where suicide is threatened. The suicide risk has only been advanced as a ground for abortion in cases where the State, in one way or another, directly or indirectly, was attempting to restrict the freedom of a woman to travel. The terms of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act will protect that freedom and will not compromise it in any way. The Government believes the evidence considered in the preparation of the Green Paper, and the testimony and conclusions in the report of the all-party committee, do not support the maintenance of suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland and would not justify the enactment of a legal basis for abortion to avoid such a risk. Such studies as have been undertaken suggest that pregnancy has a 'protective effect'. In a large UK study the rate of suicide in pregnancy was found to be only one-twentieth that of a similar matched non-pregnant population. Similar results have been demonstrated in other studies. It is important to exercise caution when interpreting the epidemiological data from other jurisdictions with different cultures and where legal abortion is available on a range of grounds, and the Government's view is not based solely on these studies. In contrast to the type of situation which will be covered by the Bill, it is very difficult to assess whether a risk of suicide is genuine. Evidence to the all-party committee suggests that it is very difficult to accurately predict suicide. Dr. John D. Sheehan, consultant in perinatal psychiatry at the Rotunda Hospital, indicated there is no test or fail-safe way of saying that a person will or will not commit suicide and that where suicide occurs it is due to the interaction of multiple factors, rather than just one. The evidence heard by the committee also indicates that the medical response to a pregnant woman considered to be at risk of committing suicide would be to help and support her and to treat her underlying mental condition. Providing for abortion where a woman's mental health may be at risk is one of the principal grounds on which abortion is permitted [30] in other countries and experience elsewhere strongly suggests that a change in the law to deal, on compassionate grounds, with a small number of exceptional cases can be exploited to allow wide scale application.;3238204

In that context, people should be informed about the implications of our choosing a particular route to take on this issue. [94] In my opinion, we will be facing the prospect of the establishment of abortion clinics in Ireland. I understand, from the presentations that were made, that a woman who is legally entitled to abortion under the regime that has existed since 1992 could do so. Let us inform the people that this is what is involved and if that is acceptable to them they should vote accordingly. Another reason women travel to Britain is to be found in the book, Women in Crisis Pregnancy. It is stated on page 335 that the journey to England was always difficult and women would be scared that they would be seen. One young woman stated: 'You have to tell so many lies because you're coming over. It was tricky. Even going to the airport I was looking around me thinking, everybody knows where I'm going. You know, you're paranoid and everything. It was just how I felt'. Do Members believe that the hundreds of women interviewed for that book would feel less obvious and more comfortable going to an abortion clinic in Ireland?;3238208

I support Deputy Olivia Mitchell's request that anyone participating in the debate, inside or outside the House, should take account of the feelings of the women who have had that experience. Everything we say and the way in which we approach this matter can and will cause hurt. The fact that we are discussing the issue of abortion again will cause every woman who has an abortion to undergo some form of trauma and to relive the experience. Whatever [95] we do, even if it is only Deputy Roche screaming across the Chamber at Deputy Owen, it belittles no-one to agree that insensitive language can hurt women who have experienced abortion.;3238216

As a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution I had the opportunity to participate in the process of consultation which was very worthwhile. We had had the Green Paper, but it was at our request that the doctors of the main maternity hospitals came in, though I am open to correction on that. We had all the interested groups in and there were 100,000 submissions. The obvious groups came in to make their position known and with one exception they made their case in a balanced, fair and passionate way. I exclude Youth Defence and give full credit to Deputy Brian Lenihan, who chaired the committee, for handling it well. I would nearly urge it to butt out and stay away from this. It certainly did not advance its cause at the hearings and did not do itself any justice. The approach of those from all sides who came in to argue the pro-life and pro-choice cases, whatever one wants to call them, was balanced, reasonable and measured. It was not the frenzy we remember from the previous referendum. The medical practitioners came in at the request of the committee to make presentations.

Why did we allow the situation to develop as it did? It is dishonest. [96] I have had the benefit of three successful births without any problems. One does not realise or understand the kind of difficulties maternity hospitals must deal with on a daily basis and how they protect lives while ensuring mothers and children go home safely. The practitioners concerned pointed out that this was not as simple as people attempted to suggest. I do not want to be confrontational, but it is relevant that they felt they had been left without the legal protection of the House under various Governments in carrying out procedures necessary to save the lives of mothers. We left them stranded. I do not have the transcripts, but that is on the record. They felt there was a possibility they were operating outside the law. Those were the words of one of the masters of the main maternity hospitals. They felt we had left them exposed legally because of the uncertainty as to whether, legally, they were allowed to provide women with necessary medical care. We are talking emotionally about rolling back and refusing a suicidal woman the right to an abortion, but we also left hundreds of thousands of women at risk because we sat on our hands and did nothing. We said: 'The medical profession will deal with that and hopefully it will not end in court' and that is what we all did. We did not move too fast when it was needed. I know the reason it has been said that this is a rerun of the 1992 referendum, but I disagree. I know people who voted 'No' on what was described as the substantive issue, as all Members do. There were two main reasons. One was that those who voted against it, just as is the case today, believed it was wrong to remove the suicide option. Equally – I note my feelings of the time – women believed that that particular amendment decreased the amount of certainty and security they had about their own health. They felt this was going back to a situation where if the lives of both the mother and the child were at risk then the mother was going to die. That was the kind of anecdotal comment made by men and women who voted against the substantive issue in the 1992 referendum. This legislation clearly states that any medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended, where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life – that is clearly stated, which was not the case in 1992—;3238224

This was stated in the Green Paper and the various medical practitioners who came to the hearings said it was necessary to define 'abortion'. Previous speakers have referred to this in the context of dancing on the head of a pin and whether it was a necessary medical procedure or indirect. We have a definition which clarifies matters considerably. I do not have enough time to discuss the crisis pregnancy agency, but I am delighted the Minister has established it. Often there is a need to put one's money where one's mouth is and this is the one proposal for which there was total cross-party support at the review group. I commend it as it is very worthwhile. Ultimately, the people will decide on this issue. At least the Government has a clear position. As has been discovered, it is not acceptable to some Members and it may not be acceptable to the public, but it is a proposition. I hope Fine Gael will adopt a policy on this.

I do not want to play the old veteran card, but I have a sense of deja vu and of old recordings being played again. I remind Deputy McGennis that the 1983 wording was Fianna Fáil's and it was insisted that that be retained even when medical, legal and legislative Members pointed out that it was filled with danger. The then Attorney General, Peter Sutherland, not only pointed that out, but attempted to introduce a safer wording. That is the history. To put it into perspective, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who then led Fine Gael and the Government, publicly asked people to vote against the wording. He realised from the medical and legal expertise he had received that it could place women in danger and that it could also be counterproductive to the pro-life movement which was pushing for it it could introduce everything it was fighting against, the legalisation of abortion in the country. Lo and behold, nine years later in 1992 it all came to pass. Decent, committed people who wished nothing bad for women were appalled that that was the outcome of a measure they believed was protecting mothers and babies. That is why we, on this side of the House, are saying please be careful. From what we see as the flaws in the proposed legislation, not only could this happen again but it could do so in a much more proportionate way. This is not a matter of [98] us sitting on the fence. Anybody who knows the record of most of us in this House knows that is not the case. I pay tribute to Deputy McGennis for her commitment to women on this issue. Debate adjourned.;3238229

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Micheál Martin;Fianna Fáil;To take England and Wales as an example, data from the Office for National Statistics (Abortion Statistics Annual Reference Volume) shows that, in the year 2000, more than 175,000 abortions were performed, and whereas 134 of these were performed because of a risk to the woman's life, more than 162,000, or 92%, were solely on the grounds of risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the woman. The Government is satisfied that, even though there is great public sympathy for the plight of women who find themselves with a crisis pregnancy, to provide for abortion where a woman in such a situation threatened suicide would not command widespread support and could, in effect, ultimately open the way to abortion on social grounds. The Government has therefore come to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the courts' judgments in the cases to which I have referred, on the available evidence, it would not be appropriate to legislate to permit abortion where, during pregnancy, a woman threatens suicide. The prescribing of emergency contraception is an accepted part of medical practice for many doctors in Ireland, and has been for many years. In evidence to the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, Professor Gerard Bury, President of the Medical Council, said, 'It is currently a part of normal practice that hasn't been challenged or, in fact, even addressed within the ethical guidelines. It is seen as normal practice.' However the drug usually prescribed is an increased dose of the ordinary oral contraceptive pill, which is not licensed for use as emergency contraception. The all-party committee advocated in its report that any legal uncertainties that may exist in regard to the morning after pill should be removed. The Government accepts that this is unsatisfactory and that any doubts about the legality of drugs used as emergency contraception should be addressed. Under these proposals the use of emergency contraception, in the form of the morning after pill and the post-coital IUD, will not be prohibited. It is important to stress that the use of any drug to end an established pregnancy will be prohibited under the Act. Drugs are now available, and others may be developed in the future, which are intended to bring about an abortion, without surgical intervention. The licensing of such products in Ireland [31] would not be permissible under the proposed legislation. Bearing in mind that the envisaged legislation will require the holding of a referendum if it is to be amended in any way, it is considered appropriate to provide a more flexible mechanism for the approval of certain hospitals for the purposes of the Act. It is therefore intended that arrangements will be put in place to enable a Minister of the Government, by order, to approve certain hospitals. The term 'approved place' is intended to be applied to hospitals under responsible management and possessing adequate expertise in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology and in the treatment and prevention of life-threatening diseases arising out of or complicated by pregnancy. Section 2 deals with the prohibition of abortion within the State. The criminal offence of abortion is restated in clear, modern terms and the legal penalties are specified in terms which leave no doubt about the seriousness of the offence. The rebuttable provision regarding the presumption of the natural and probable consequences of a person's conduct replicates the ordinary provisions relating to criminal intent, as set out in the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, in respect of homicide. The purpose of this provision is to ensure a person who, for example, administered a drug or performed a medical procedure, the effect of which was to end unborn human life, would be presumed to have intended this outcome. He or she could, however, rebut that presumption by establishing, in a jury's mind, a reasonable doubt that he or she did not intend to end unborn human life, despite the fact that that was the natural and probable consequence of his or her actions. Contravention of the law in relation to abortion includes, as offences, attempted abortion and aiding, abetting, counselling or procurement of such abortion. The prohibitions encompass those currently contained in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which are repealed by section 6. Under existing legislation, any person, including the pregnant woman, who procures an abortion is liable, on conviction on indictment, to be sentenced to imprisonment for life or any lesser penalty. That is the current position, under existing legislation, and has been so for a very long time. This Bill differs from that and provides for a penalty of up to 12 years. I accept that some people have concerns about the potential criminalisation of a pregnant woman who procures her own abortion. In practice, of course, prosecutions against women in such a situation are extremely rare, if they have been taken at all for very many years. (Interruptions.);3238233

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Micheál Martin;Fianna Fáil;The requirement in section 2(4) that a prosecution may be brought only by, or with the consent of, the Director of Public Prosecutions ensures that frivolous or mischievous cases cannot be brought before the courts. The purpose of section 3 is to provide that a medical practitioner, or any other person, will not be obliged to carry out a procedure to which he or she has a conscientious objection, even though it may not constitute abortion under the Act. Given that the Act in effect simply provides legal protection for current medical practice, it is not expected that this provision will have any adverse effect on current practices. Section 4 deals with travel and information. The Act protects freedom to travel and the right to information in accordance with the existing provisions in the Constitution, approved by the people in 1992. It also makes clear that a court shall not restrict a person from travelling to another state on grounds that his or her conduct there would be an offence under this Act, were it to occur in Ireland. I have already referred to the issues about the right to travel in the context of the C case of 1997 and the Act will ensure there is no longer any doubt over a person's right to travel abroad. There is no question of a person's right to travel outside Ireland being interfered with in any way by the State, whatever his or her circumstances or reason for travelling. Section 5 deals with the arrangements which apply to orders made under section 1 of the Act. The terms used are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes which might well occur in the future, such as a change in the title of a Minister in the Government. It is for this reason that the term 'a member of the Government' is used, rather than the current title of a Minister. An order made under this section of the Act, in addition to designating specific hospitals as approved places for the purposes of section 1(2) of the Act, may deal with the making and keeping of records of medical procedures. This may include records of opinions and confirmation of records. Orders must be laid before the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House within a period of 21 sitting days. These arrangements enable orders to be changed where appropriate, for example allowing new hospitals to be designated, should this become necessary, without such a matter having to be the subject of an amendment of the Act, which would, of course, have to be approved in a referendum before it could have effect. Section 6 repeals the current legislation prohibiting abortion, in the form of sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, [33] as these provisions are to be replaced by those contained in section 2 of this Act. The proposals in this Bill represent a fair and reasonable attempt to resolve the constitutional and legal difficulties that have surrounded the issue of abortion since the judgment in the X case in 1992. They are also the culmination of a lengthy and detailed process of consultation and debate and the time has come to move on from this and attempt to resolve matters for the future. A pregnant woman should be entitled to whatever medical treatment she may need, even where this may unavoidably place the survival of her unborn child at risk. Any legal doubt about what is permissible in such cases must also be removed, so that doctors will be able to continue to provide the necessary treatment in accordance with established medical practice. The Irish health care system has an enviable reputation when it comes to the care of expectant mothers and their children and what is proposed in this Bill will protect current practice, not change it. For the reasons which I have described, a simple constitutional provision with no legislative backing would run a major risk of subsequently being interpreted by the courts in a manner not anticipated. Therefore, the means which the Government has chosen is the best way of ensuring that safeguards are put in place which spell out, in straightforward terms, what is and what is not allowed and which can be amended only if the people in a further referendum wish to do so. The Government believes this approach represents a reasonable view which will command the support of the middle ground of public opinion. It aims to be compassionate and realistic while also providing an honest response to the harsh realities faced by many women in this country. I am hopeful that this proposal will command general support as a prudent, workable, sensible, caring and compassionate approach to what is for everyone an emotive issue and, for some, the most important issue in their lives. I commend the Bill to the House.;3238236

I move amendment No. 1: To delete all the words after that and substitute: Dáil Éireann, conscious of the need to approach with great care any proposals to incorporate the effects of detailed legislation into the Constitution, noting that Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann are being asked to pass legislation which will be open to interpretation by the courts but not amendment by the Oireachtas if the courts make an interpretation not envisaged by the Oireachtas or the people, noting that future amendments to the proposed legislation if passed will not be subject to the President's [34] right to refer such amending Bills to the Supreme Court, noting in particular the unprecedented proposal to allow a Minister, by order, vary the effect of a constitutional provision in relation to evidence to be retained as to whether a medical procedure or an abortion, both as defined in the Bill, had taken place and by order to determine and vary the approved places where such medical procedures may in future take place, defers the second reading of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, to enable the Government to present to Dáil Éireann satisfactory reasons for the mechanisms being proposed and their implications for the Oireachtas, the courts and the public interest and resolves accordingly that the Bill be read a Second Time this day three months. The Minister's response to our motion will influence our vote on the Second Stage of this Bill if it is proceeded with at this time. Fine Gael made a constructive contribution to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and instigated the proposal for a compassionate, pro-active and adequately funded structure to meet the needs of women in crisis pregnancy. Our Care of Persons Board Bill, 2001, published last month is evidence of our real concern to reduce the number of abortions. There are three strands to this issue: the legislative and constitutional process the Fine Gael Care of Persons Board Bill and a structured approach by the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, other Departments, health boards and NGOs to promote education and prevention of unwanted pregnancy. Fine Gael's preferred approach is to separate the second and third strands. My comments today relate in the main to what I described as the first strand, following on the publication of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. Over the summer, Fine Gael published a second Private Members' Bill, the Surgeon General Bill, 2001. Our objective is to create the Office of Surgeon General, which will work with the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. Fine Gael proposes that the Surgeon General should have the same relationship with the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children as the Comptroller and Auditor General has with the Committee of Public Accounts. The Surgeon General will independently report to the Oireachtas on the operation of the health services. The Judiciary and medical practitioners will have a role in applying the provisions of the twenty-fifth amendment if passed. The Oireachtas can remove members of the Judiciary for stated misbehaviour. The Oireachtas has no power over medical practitioners. A Surgeon General could report to the Oireachtas on any [35] health issue, including treatment during pregnancy. This would allow the Oireachtas to receive independent advice on the implementation of the amendment if passed and would provide a degree of transparency, which would inform public opinion. In relation to the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, Fine Gael continues to participate in the process by our amendment today as we did in the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. The process of developing national policy in this area commenced in 1979 and continued through the Green Paper in 1999 and the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in 2000. Fine Gael recognises that people have the right to seek to amend the Constitution and this is specifically provided for in article 6 of the Constitution, which reads: All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good. The Fine Gael Party has concerns about the Bill to which I will return later. We have scrutinised it with a view to considering the Government's proposal to put the matter to the people in a referendum. The Government's proposals, involving as they do an amendment to incorporate the effect of detailed legislation into the Constitution for the first time, need careful examination. For all we know there could be weaknesses in the proposals that we have not discovered on first reading. This is why the reading and Report Stages require careful attention on this occasion. As the Bill stands, we have serious reservations. For example, any medical practitioner, even one just out of training, could decide to carry out the medical procedure referred to in section 1(2). Senior physicians have already questioned this provision. By contrast a lawyer cannot even decide a minor court case until he or she has the ten year post-qualification requirements to become a judge. Incidentally the wording does not refer to a registered medical practitioner. In 1983, a short amendment to the Constitution seemed to be watertight. On the first challenge and to the surprise of those who proposed and supported the amendment, the Supreme Court ruling in the X case showed this not to be the case. The Government now effectively proposes a much longer amendment and this may even widen the scope for interpretation by the Supreme Court. For example, in article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution, the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. This is believed by those who supported the [36] 1983 amendment and others to apply from conception. Section 1(1) of the Bill, which if passed will be added as article 40. 3.4º of the Constitution, seeks to protect unborn human life after implantation in the womb, but implantation is not defined. Conception is not mentioned anywhere in article 40. 3.3º and a future Supreme Court could, for example, take the whole of the article as amended into account. Whether this could reduce protection to the unborn between conception and implantation is not clear. We note that the State must defend and vindicate the lives of the unborn under article 40. 3.3º. Under article 40. 3.4º as proposed, effectively the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy Act, 2002. The words 'defend and vindicate' seem stronger than 'protect'. Aside from the scope for interpretation which the Supreme Court may have it appears that the Medical Council has latitude in relation to changing ethical guidelines and that these can change with relative ease and behind closed doors as happened over the summer. The Medical Council ethical guidelines use the words 'where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother'. This is slightly different from those being proposed in the constitutional amendment. Under the Government's proposals a designated Minister would be allowed to authorise approved places where medical procedures would be carried out. It is proposed to give a Minister power to do this by order. An order could be narrow and name only one or two places, or wide and name any doctor's surgery. It could also be varied. Similarly by order, a Minister would have power to vary the type of records a medical practitioner would have to keep as evidence of a medical procedure under section 1(2) as distinct from an abortion under section 1(1). This power could be used on the one hand to blur the distinction between a medical procedure and an abortion. On the other hand, it could be used to require such detailed records to be kept that no medical practitioner would feel safe carrying out such a procedure for fear of prosecution. A minority party or even Independent Deputies could, for example, make demands either way as part of the price for supporting a Government in office. Thus, a small minority could effectively set aside the wishes of the people. That a Minister would have power to vary the effect of a constitutional amendment is without precedent and, at best, is questionable. Section 2(3) provides that the penalty for carrying out an abortion as defined could range from a fine, which is unspecified, to 12 years imprisonment. This would be entirely at the discretion of the Judiciary. A future Judiciary might view abortion in such a light that only nominal fines would be applied, thereby rendering restraint on criminal abortion ineffective. A human embryo is the new organism which comes into existence at fertilisation. This organ[37] ism is not simply a collection of cells but, to quote the Australian Senate 1986 select committee considering human embryo experimentation in Australia, 'is oriented towards further development'. A European People's Party document, Union of Value, presented to the EPP congress at Berlin in January 2001, stated, 'Distinctions between human person and person, or between the embryo as a potential human being cannot be made without introducing an unacceptable kind of discrimination.' This issue needs to be considered in the light of what is contained in Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution and what is proposed to be given constitutional effect in Article 40. 3.4º, if passed. The job of the Opposition is to treat legislation with the consideration it deserves, to point to its weaknesses and to seek to improve it. This is especially true where legislation is to be given constitutional status, perhaps for all time. The content of an amendment of the Constitution Bill which is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas will determine our attitude to the subsequent referendum campaign. We do not understand why a press conference was hurriedly and unexpectedly called to launch these proposals and we do not intend to be rushed in our consideration of the important contents of this Bill. The Second Schedule provides that the Short Title of the Act may read 'Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002.' This means the legislation is not to be enacted until next year and it gives time for detailed consideration of these proposals. We should use it to reflect on what are life and death issues. In 1979, the Oireachtas passed the Health (Family Planning) Act, which incorporated into law the provisions of the British Offences Against the Person, 1861, which made it illegal to procure a miscarriage. Until then the 1861 Act had been the law on abortion. In 1983, the proposal contained in the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was passed by referendum and this was inserted as Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. In 1986, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, SPUC, successfully obtained an injunction restraining the Dublin Well Woman Centre and Open Door Counselling from providing information which encouraged or facilitated abortion. This decision was upheld in 1988 by the Supreme Court when it was established that this restraint extended to the provision of addresses and telephone numbers. In 1992, the Dublin Well Woman Centre and Open Door Counselling took the matter to the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds that the Supreme Court decision breached the right to freedom of expression. The Strasbourg court ruled in their favour. In the same year the Supreme Court ruled that a 14 year old girl, pregnant as a result of rape and who was considered to be suicidal, had the right to travel outside the State for an abortion because of the real and substantial threat to her life. This became known as the X case. The judgment also [38] suggested that had she not been suicidal her right to travel for an abortion might be restricted. As a result of this and following on much public debate, three further amendments to the Constitution were proposed in 1992, which sought first, to clarify the law on what was meant by a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother, second, to deal with the right to travel and, third, to deal with the right to information. The wording of the proposed amendment to deal with what was meant by a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother stated, 'It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self destruction.' This was opposed by both sides of the debate and was defeated. The other two amendments were passed and are now incorporated in Article 40. 3.3º. Legislation was introduced in 1995, which dealt with how information would be provided. In 1997, the High Court ruled that a 13 year old girl, pregnant as a result of rape in the care of a health board, could be taken out of the State for an abortion by the board even though this course was opposed by her parents. The judgment was never appealed. In 1999, the Green Paper on Abortion was published by the Government and in 2000 the All-Party Committee on the Constitution published its report, which has been considered by a Cabinet sub-committee. This summer Fine Gael published two Bills, to which I have referred, and in recent months the Medical Council changed its medical guidelines. This series of events illustrates that the issues involved can become very technical. They have given rise to court cases, both here and at the European Court of Justice. They have been interpreted in a way not envisaged by this House or the people. We should not take a solely legalistic approach to this. The number of legal aspects involved has meant we have not given due regard to the wider issues and to those who are vulnerable. That is why last September, I launched the Care of Persons Board Bill on behalf of Fine Gael. I said then that women experiencing crisis pregnancy need to be supported by the State and that for too long the State has failed to put in place proper support structures to assist them, leaving such work to excellent but over-stretched and under resourced voluntary organisations. Fine Gael supports the establishment of such support structures through the Bill. We envisage that the role of the board would be to support and facilitate any expectant mother experiencing a crisis pregnancy to bring her pregnancy to full term. There is a tendency in Ireland to seek comprehensive solutions and to take no action until we have a magic formula. We should have considered separating the issues in the way I have suggested because some give rise to the need for [39] accommodation and such like while others give rise to the need for sexual education and prevention. They are not necessarily best grouped into the same agency, although I acknowledge that the agency that has been established, which Fine Gael first proposed, is an improvement. Much of the debate to date has centred on the argument for or against further constitutional amendment. Fine Gael played its part in the Oireachtas all-party committee on abortion. It was our proposal in the committee's report that led to recommendation for the establishment of an entity to support women in crisis pregnancy and their unborn. It is in that area that we will do most to reduce the rate of pregnancy in Ireland. The Oireachtas all-party committee report noted that nobody knows the exact numbers of Irish women having abortions outside the State but it is clear that a significant number do. According to the report of the committee, the statistics supplied by the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales show that in 1971, 578 women 'normally resident in the Republic of Ireland' had abortions, while in 1999 the figure was estimated at 6,226. The Oireachtas all-party committee report contained a section headed, Themes related to an Abortion Decision, and included a record of interviews which set out the reasons given for having an abortion. Career or job related concerns were given as the reason by 36 people. The stigma of lone parenthood was cited by 30. The number quoting needs of the child was 30 while the figure quoting financial unreadiness was 28. Twenty-seven quoted unreadiness for a child and 24 the inability to cope. Being too young was the reason given by 22. Nineteen already had a child and 17 said it was their body and their right. Education and training was cited by 14, ten never wanted a child, seven gave as their reason the stigma on parents, six said there was no way they could have a child at this time and four said they were too old. More than one third of those interviewed cited stigma, financial unreadiness and the inability to cope as their reasons. That is why we have to put huge amounts of our energy, effort and resources into helping women and their extended families during crisis pregnancies. If we were serious about the issue that is what we would do. Some women may choose abortion because they find themselves in a crisis and feel helpless and unsupported. In many cases they may feel they have nowhere to turn. We have already had a Green Paper and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution agreed that a major problem facing Ireland is the large number of crisis pregnancies resulting in recourse to abortion facilities available in Great Britain. It also spoke of the urgent need to adopt measures to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and that women in such pregnancies must be offered a real and positive alter[40] native to abortion. It said there is an urgent need to reduce the rate of abortion. It must be clear to the House that whatever happens to this Bill, whether it is passed here or endorsed by the people, we are not going to deal with this issue unless we commit wholeheartedly to assisting those in crisis pregnancies, to prevention of such pregnancies and to education. That is where we have to concentrate our efforts. Our Bill contains specific proposals to address aspects of this issue about which we are very concerned. The Minister has already outlined what the Bill will contain if it is amended. I will not repeat that, but I do need to raise some concerns which I will return to on Committee Stage. The Second Schedule of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, repeals sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. Section 1(1) defines abortion as 'the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman'. People have various interpretations, but that is the one described in the Bill. Section 1(2) states: Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, abortion does not involve the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which the unborn human life is ended where the procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction. Let us be clear about this. That would be described by any medical dictionary as abortion. It has not been described as abortion in this case. It is described as a 'medical procedure' and is being permitted. We need to know exactly what the proposal is. The 'approved place' is to be decided by ministerial order. 'Medical practitioner' means a person permitted by law to practice as a medical practitioner in the State. 'Reasonable opinion' means a reasonable opinion formed in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life where practicable and of which a written record has been made and signed by the practitioner. 'Woman' means a female person. However, 'medical procedure' is not defined. Why is that? Perhaps the Minister will tell us when he replies. Section 1(2) differentiates between 'abortion' and 'medical procedure' so why is it not defined along with the other definitions? The Bill even defines what a 'woman' is. Section 2 prohibits the carrying out of abortions in the State, though this is confined to 'abortion' as defined in section 1(1). This section also provides for imprisonment for up to 12 years or a fine, or both, for a person who attempts to carry out an abortion or who aids, abets, counsels or procures any person to do so. Section 3 provides that 'nothing in the Act should be con[41] strued as obliging any person to carry out any medical procedure referred to in section 1 of this Act'. It allows for conscientious objection. Section 4 deals with travel and information but section 5 provides that an authorised member of the Government may make orders relating to 'the making, keeping and confirmation of records (including records of opinion) of medical procedures referred to in section 1 of this Act as may be considered by the member of the Government concerned necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this Act'. It provides that an order may be amended or revoked by order. Section 5(4) states: An order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder. Section 5 is of central importance in determining whether a medical procedure which terminates unborn human life is 'in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life'. 'Reasonable opinion' means a reasonable opinion formed in good faith and of which a written record has been made and signed by the practitioner. This section requires careful consideration. It could, as currently drafted, give rise to a blurring of the distinction between 'abortion' as defined by section 1(1) and a 'medical procedure' as set out in section 1(2). Some future Minister might require only a perfunctory written record to be kept by a practitioner or require such detailed records to be kept that a medical practitioner would shy away from medical procedures for fear of committing a criminal offence. A Minister could, thereby, frustrate the will of the people if the proposed amendment to the Constitution is passed. Ministerial orders do not normally receive detailed consideration or even the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas. People may feel that they know what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is going to do. They may feel they know what I, or some other Member of the House, would do, but do they know what the Minister will do in ten years' time? Perhaps it will be decided that this is a Bill to deal with pregnancy. This Bill deals with a constitutional issue. Should any Minister in any Government have power, by order, to vary the effect of a constitutional amendment following the vote of the people and enactment by this House? It is a very dangerous proposition. It is something I will be examining very closely. I have been reasoned and careful in what I have said today and I ask the Minister to carefully heed what I say about this section. As drafted it gives rise to very serious concerns. He should forget about it being he who is in office and think in [42] terms of who could be there. It might be someone who is extremely conservative or someone who is extremely, so-called, liberal. How, or why, should anybody have the right to vary provisions in the Constitution in such a way? I now turn to some of the replies which were given to my colleague, Deputy Noonan, the leader of Fine Gael, by the Taoiseach. A number of my colleagues will be referring to this and I do not want to steal their thunder, but I will mention a few matters in the time that is left to me. Acting Chairman: The official time left to the Deputy is four minutes, but in the context of allowing the Minister to complete his speech he has perhaps another seven minutes.;3238237
1684;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im. Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Gay Mitchell;Fine Gael;I will try to get through this as quickly as I can. In the reply to the fourth question asked, the Taoiseach told Deputy Noonan that the Government's proposal recognises that it is not practicable to attempt to protect, by the criminal law of abortion, the fertilised ovum prior to implantation in the womb of a woman. That is a very interesting statement. What are its implications for embryo or stem-cell research? Some of the replies given to these questions are hostages to fortune. That is a very interesting statement which requires attention. The reply to the seventh question declared that it is not anticipated that the Government's proposals for amendment will impinge on those rights of the unborn and the mother already identified in the Constitution. It is not anticipated, which means that it is not known. Nobody knows whether it will impinge on them. It will be left to the courts. If the courts anticipate in a way that we or the people do not intend, there will nothing we can do about it. The use of words such as 'anticipate' is questionable as one has to ask by whom it is anticipated. It is a very subjective use of language. In the reply to Question No. 9, the Taoiseach referred to the possibility of a medical practitioner with no experience or expertise in the area having access to a hospital designated as an approved place for the purpose of the legislation being too remote. Where in the Bill is the word 'hospital' mentioned? There is no mention of hospitals in the question or the Bill. In the past, if somebody told me that I would have a fully equipped office in my house with on-line computer facilities and access to the Oireachtas and that I could send all my e-mails from home, I would have said it was not practical. In time to come, it is likely that there will be sufficient technical capacity – if it does not already exist – for any GP to carry out one of these procedures in a surgery. I know the Minister has no intention of licensing a surgery, but he will not be the Minister for-ever. We are giving some future Minister the right to vary this in any way he wants. I do not know, therefore, why the Taoiseach should use the word 'hospital' as it is not mentioned anywhere. [43] As I said earlier, a medical practitioner – not a registered medical practitioner – straight out of college will have the right to carry out such a procedure. This is quite dangerous. It also says 'approved places' is intended to be applied to hospitals under responsible management possessing adequate expertise in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology. Who says this? It is not in the legislation, nor is it on any proposal before us. With regard to the reply to Question No. 10, it says that 'these safeguards and the parliamentary scrutiny provided for in section 5(4) are considered to be sufficient to prevent the abuse of unauthorised places'. They certainly are not. Orders are never scrutinised by this House. They go into the library, which is what will happen to these orders in due course. We will all be so busy with legislation that any Minister could make orders, put copies in the library, and we would not even see them. They certainly will not be debated. We are talking about belts and braces, putting things into the Constitution because they must have its protection. Then we leave the barn gate open for this sort of fudge, which is very peculiar. The reply to Question No. 11 says it is not essential that the practitioner must form the opinion unaided or without guidance. That is not the point because it is possible. One does not require any assistance or expertise. One just has to be out of college, qualified as a medical practitioner – that is all. It also says in the reply that the medical practitioner is always 'responsible for the lawfulness of procedures carried out by him or her'. We all know, and the people should know, that if one asked the Medical Council whether its members would follow the Constitution and the law of the land or follow the ethical guidelines of the Medical Council, they would say they would follow the latter. The reference to 'lawfulness of procedures' is not a great assurance. The reply to Question No. 14 says it is the Government's view that the medical consensus in the profession is the only thing which now stands between us and the de facto introduction of what they call 'social abortion' in this country, a term which some people find offensive. If this is true, why did the Minister not legislate to address the matter before now? Since 1987, this Government has been in office, with the exception of two and a half years. The reply makes a very bold statement. Now, instead of dealing with the issue properly, we have to alter the Constitution to do so. The reply is extraordinary. There are questions to be raised concerning the X case and others will do that. I will not do so because it would take too much time to raise the two aspects of the issue that concern me. However, I will return to the matter on Committee Stage. It says in reply to Question No. 17 that 'there is nothing in the proposed amendment or in the [44] envisaged legislation which would render it illegal for a health board to assist a woman to travel outside the jurisdiction in such cases'. This is in reference to the X case. Although it says it is 'not illegal', is it legal? Will the Minister answer this in his reply to the debate? In the reply to Question No. 20, the Taoiseach says 'no plausible scenario involving any difficulty has been advanced by anyone who has raised the issue of the interaction of the proposed amendment with EU law.'. Will the Minister indicate to us in the House the status of this proposal in relation to Protocol 17 of the Maastricht Treaty? The reply to Question No. 24 says that 'the morning after pill as emergency contraception is not effective when implantation is complete'. In this respect, it is to be distinguished from the use or administration of chemical abortifacients. This begs the question of whether it can harm, and if so, can it be criminalised under section 43(3)? Most of our discussion in this regard refers to section 43(4). Will the Minister state, since he is using the term 'implantation', when it starts? How long does it take? What is the time frame in terms of the constitutional protection for the implanted unborn? When does that time start running because there is no definition of it? We would like to know how the Minister arrived at that use of wording. There are many other questions that may arise in due course. We have touched only on some of them today in the opening of this debate. It is my duty, and that of the Opposition, to closely examine sections of proposed legislation. We will have to be very vigilant in this case as it is intended to incorporate such detailed wording into the Constitution itself. This is the constitutional duty of the Dáil and Seanad and it is a vital part of the democratic process. If the Bill passes and the people vote favourably in the referendum, within 180 days the Oireachtas must put the Bill into effect or else it will fall. It is a most unusual practice to tie the hands of the Oireachtas in this way, not just in terms of what must be dealt with if the people approve this, and to give us no choice but to accept that or to ignore the will of the people. It is a strange choice to give us. We could ignore the will of the people, but never again thereafter will we have the chance to amend that legislation, unless there is a Constitutional amendment. That will not apply to the Medical Council or the Supreme Court, or to the Minister in the orders he would make. Fine Gael does not believe it is best practice to incorporate detailed provisions in the Constitution. We recognise that, under Article 6 of the Constitution, it is ultimately a matter for the people to decide. However, legislators have been given the right under the Constitution to decide on which amendment should be put to the people. While the right of the Oireachtas to pass any legislation it deems fit for amendment of the Constitution for consideration by the people is [45] enshrined, Members of the Oireachtas have also been give an Constitutional right and duty to frame such amending legislation. The job of the Opposition is to treat serious legislation with the consideration it deserves, point out its weaknesses and try to improve it. This is particularly true of the legislation we are discussing. I hope the Minister will allow the disquisition that is necessary on this Bill and accept the amendment I am tabling today on behalf of Fine Gael.;3238238

1686;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im. Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;F;Ms. Liz McManus;Democratic Left;Very good. The Labour Party amendment reads: To delete all words after 'Dáil Éireann' and substitute the following: 'declines to give a Second Reading because a) the procedure is legally and constitutionally flawed b) it dilutes the equal right to life of the mother and c) it seeks to overturn the decision taken by the people in 1992 upholding the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case.'. Yesterday 18 Irish women travelled to Britain to have abortions. Today as we begin this debate 18 more Irish women are travelling to Britain to have abortions. Tomorrow another 18 will travel. This will go on each day this debate continues and, when the debate is over, nothing will have changed for these women. Approximately 100,000 Irish women have made that journey since 1983 when the people voted to include Article 40. 3.3º in the Constitution. It states that the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. In 1992 the Supreme Court determined in the X case that a threat to self-destruction can amount to a substantial risk to the life of the mother. This decision enabled an abused 14 year old girl to have an abortion. Subsequently the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, introduced a new amendment to the Constitution specifically excluding suicide as grounds for consideration in a possible medical termination of pregnancy. At the time, the Progressive Democrats Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said in the House: [46] Since the Supreme Court decision in the X case there has been no sudden rush to the courts by women looking for an abortion on the basis that they are suicidal. This is not a particular problem now, and there is no pressing reason to exclude it constitutionally as a basis for a termination in every case in the future. We must be willing to consider the fact that some very unusual suicide case may arise where a woman cannot for some reason or another leave the jurisdiction and where a real and unavoidable risk of self-destruction exists. For example, a young pregnant girl may become severely anorexic after a multiple rape. Such a girl with her unborn could be condemned by this amendment with the hands of the Supreme Court tied, thus preventing any sensible intervention to save her life. Almost ten years later he has been proved right. There has been no sudden rush to the courts, even to this day. There was the C case which was an unusual and dreadful suicide case which came before the courts. The courts found in favour of the girl seeking an abortion on the basis of the Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 40. 3.3º and her life was saved. It is the view of the Labour Party that the removal of suicide as grounds for an abortion would constitute a grave, if rare, risk to women's lives. It was our view in 1992 and it remains our view in 2001. Regrettably, this time around the Progressive Democrats have ditched principle in favour of political expediency. Many people listened to and squirmed at the weasel words of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, at the press conference to launch the Bill when she defended the indefensible somersault executed by her and her party. The choice between radical and redundant has now been made by the Progressive Democrats. They have chosen the latter and are clinging desperately to the Government train until it runs out of steam. In 1992 when the amendment was put to the people, they rejected it. Whenever – if ever, because there is still a doubt about this – it is put again, I believe the people will reject it again. Now that we are debating the Bill we have a duty to clear away the fog. There has been so much window-dressing, clever disguise and obfuscation by the Government in its presentation of this new amendment that we need to speak plainly in the House. The amendment being presented by the Taoiseach is, in essence, identical to the one put to the people in 1992 by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. It is designed to take away a fundamental right to life Irish women enjoy under our Constitution. Only the removal of suicide as grounds for abortion is at variance with the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court. It is the only part of the Bill which requires a referendum. Despite the fact the people voted to retain that protection for women's lives in 1992, the Government refuses to accept the will of the people and is again pursuing an answer denied to it in the past. [47] The chairman of the expert review group on the Constitution, Ken Whitaker, someone who would describe himself as pro-life, considered that about 3% of pregnant women were suicidal or were at risk of suicide. He said during his presentation to the Joint Committee on the Constitution: . . . one has to ask oneself in the case not just of pregnant women generally but women who are pregnant and victims of rape or incest, what is the risk? They might figure largely in constituting that 3%. That is the point I am making. I wouldn't get the impression that it has been ruled out completely it's very rare, but as I rate the thing . . . it's not impossible of course, but it should be perhaps evident in a particularly severe case that there was a serious likelihood of suicide. If the four words in line 15 in the Second Schedule, 'Other than by self-destruction', were removed, there would be no need for a referendum. If those four words were removed from the Bill, it would safeguard the right to life of some poor, unfortunate pregnant woman who might be so distraught, damaged or deranged that she becomes suicidal. That woman could be the daughter of someone in the House, of a secretary, an usher or someone in the media who works in the Oireachtas. We have to ask ourselves, if she were our daughter, what would be our attitude? I have asked myself that question. If my daughter were 14 years old, horribly raped and made pregnant, I would hope she might find the strength to carry through the pregnancy. However, if the burden were too great and crushed her spirit to the point that ending her life would be preferable to continuing it, I would want her to have an abortion. If this amendment is passed, that child, who could be the daughter of anyone here, would be criminalised. She could even be jailed for 12 years, assuming she had not committed suicide. There was a disturbing coldness evident when the Minister said: I accept that some people have concerns about the potential criminalisation of a pregnant woman who procures her own abortion. In practice, of course, prosecutions against women in such a situation are extremely rare, if they have been taken at all for very many years. What happens if that rare case is one's daughter? Is that really what we want for our daughters? If not, who exactly is seeking this change? As a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitution I sat through the hearings held into the wide spectrum of opinion that prevails on the topic of abortion. No agreed wording on an amendment to the Constitution was presented to us. We heard many demands for a referendum from people who spoke strongly and sincerely about their anti-abortion views without a specific [48] definition as to how the Constitution might be changed. There was no ground swell demand to exclude suicide as grounds for an abortion. It was only at the end of the process when three divergent views were clarified in the committee that Fianna Fáil outlined it as their essential position, to remove, in effect, this protection for young women who may be so distraught, damaged or deranged that they become suicidal. The Taoiseach says that the reason he wants to remove this right is to prevent a slide into what he calls freely available 'social' abortion. This is risible. Despite the current constitutional protection, we live in a country which has the most restrictive regime on abortion in Europe, where women flee to another jurisdiction to find the succour denied to them at home. We have even been criticised by the UN for having a regime so severe that it infringes fundamental human rights. The Taoiseach conveniently ignores the simple facts. There is no evidence of any shift towards liberalisation on abortion in the ten years since the X case. During that period about 5,000 women on average travelled to Britain to have abortions. They did so, conveniently for successive Governments, in secrecy and silence. In 1996, the expert constitution review group, chaired by Dr. Ken Whitaker, considered the issue in detail and came to the conclusion that there was no consensus on any amendment to the Constitution and that not only should the Government legislate in line with the X case but that this was the only practical possibility. In making this recommendation, this eminent group of experts believed, unlike the Taoiseach, that women, doctors and legislators could be trusted. Deputy Ahern's proposal is less about the protection of women's lives or of the unborn and more about the protection of the life of a Government. It is about a commitment made to four Independent Deputies to secure their support. They sought a referendum without being able to produce a wording. The Government produced 'suicide', since no one could think of anything better, as the hook to deliver the Independents. When this legislation was published, the Taoiseach, in a speech outlining the Government's position, stated that the new law will protect both women and the unborn in pregnancy, but this is not true. The right to life that women currently enjoy under the Constitution will no longer be equal to that of the foetus, if this amendment is passed by referendum. Women's lives will not be protected in the way they are now if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats get their way. The Taoiseach went on to say that the risk of suicide has only been advanced as grounds for abortion in cases where the State, in one way or another, directly or indirectly, was attempting to restrict the freedom of a woman to travel. The new law, he said, will protect that freedom and not compromise it in any way. That is untrue. There is no guarantee that, should another C case arise where a young suicidal girl in the care of the State seeks an abortion abroad, her rights would be [49] safeguarded nor is there any guarantee for the anorexic child in Deputy O'Malley's example. However, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste stated that they see their approach as developing a consensus on the issue. This is a distortion of the facts and is dishonest. They know as well as anybody that there is no consensus on abortion in relation to any constitutional change. There never was and it is unlikely that there will in the foreseeable future. After 18 months of exhaustive work by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Brian Lenihan, it was self-evident that there was no consensus. The three different positions reflected within the committee were spelt out carefully and in detail in its report presented to the Taoiseach a year ago. Where there was consensus on the issue of reducing the rate of abortions by establishing a dedicated agency, the Government ignored it until they could wrap that proposal like a disguise around the hard, unpalatable truth that this constitutional amendment is a rerun, in essence, of 1992. I can understand that obstetricians want to see the legislative clarity that this Bill provides for the rare procedures they must carry out to save a woman's life. These procedures are abortions and no change in language as provided for in this Bill changes that fact. In his submission to the all-party committee, Dr. Peter McKenna said about this kind of medical procedure: Personally, I think that you are better to be up front and clean about this and say that the pregnancy is being aborted. That is the treatment. It is not a side effect of the treatment. It is not that it is an unintentional side effect of the treatment. The treatment is you end the pregnancy. That is, I think, abortion. A legal definition as to what is permissible in medical practice was sought by doctors for some time and they will not quibble over the wording. However, there are serious questions about the legal implications of the Government's approach, and the Minister in his response needs to clarify the following points. The amendment seeks to add two new subsections to the original Article 40. 3.3º and not to replace it. The first question is if while the new amendment and accompanying legislation is specifically designed to protect unborn life in pregnancy and practices relating to IVF, for example, are not covered, will there not be some remaining, if imprecise, effect to be given to the original subsection (3) which might well cover these circumstances and practices? In other words, although the morning after pill, the IUD and rules relating to the disposal of fertilised ova outside the womb will not be covered by the terms of the new Act which deals solely with criminal sanctions for abortion, the question remains as to whether a court might assume jurisdiction to outlaw these other practices by virtue of the original amendment. The second question relates to the arbitrary choice of implantation as the point when abortion [50] becomes possible. Many people were startled that the Attorney General appeared to upstage the theologians on the thorny question of when human life begins. Practical rather than philosophical reasons have produced the formula. If implantation is taken as the starting point for this Bill on grounds of practicality because of the difficulties of proving cause and effect in specific cases, surely the same issues of proof would arise when any post-implantation pill is administered. Yet the Government justifies banning these drugs as chemical abortifacients while justifying the widespread availability of the morning after pill. The third question relates to the Government's procedure. Unlike the case in the Good Friday Agreement, this constitutional amendment will have effect from the day it is signed into law by the President. As and from that day it will require that the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of an Act that does not at that stage exist. Essentially, therefore, a section of the Constitution, which has no meaning or effect, will be given meaning and effect by an ordinary Act of the Oireachtas coming into force at a later date. Does this not run contrary to every constitutional principle? It is clear that the level of detail needed to deal with this issue is more appropriate for ordinary legislation than for direct insertion into the Constitution. At least one reason is because ordinary legislation can be amended more easily if it proves necessary. However, in this case the Government proposes that its Bill should be as cumbersome to amend as the Constitution itself. Section 1(3) of the proposed Act defines 'medical practitioner' as meaning a 'person permitted for the time being by law to practise as a medical practitioner in the State'. Any medical practitioner, as so defined, will be entitled lawfully to terminate a pregnancy under the Bill, if he or she has formed in good faith a reasonable opinion that it is necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of a woman's life. Presumably a more specific definition was avoided in the context of a statute which itself will be so difficult to amend. Even the slightest unforeseen error in the drafting of the Bill would require yet another referendum to correct it. The interpretation of 'medical practitioner' seems to have been drafted on the assumption that Irish law permits some people to practise medicine and prohibits others from doing so. However, this assumption is false. There is no law that prevents any of us from setting ourselves up as medical practitioners. The only ban is on us holding ourselves out as registered medical practitioners, that is, persons registered in the General Register of Medical Practitioners established under section 26 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council maintains a register in which suitably qualified persons are entered. They are then referred to as 'registered medical practitioners'. It is an offence to make a false declar[51] ation in order to be entered on the register or to misrepresent oneself as registered if one is not. In addition, the Medical Council has powers to suspend doctors from the register or to apply for them to be struck off, on grounds of unfitness to practise. At the same time 'complementary' and 'alternative' medicine thrive here. Alternative medical practitioners practise lawfully in this State, provided that they do not claim to be what they are not – registered medical practitioners. There is no rule in Irish law which prohibits unregistered persons from practising medicine. If one asks then, for the purposes of the draft Bill, who is permitted for the time being by law to practise as a medical practitioner in the State, the answer is anyone. Unregistered medical practitioners may not be able to prescribe medicines but they will be able, under this Bill, to advise as to the need for a pregnancy to be terminated and to carry out such a termination themselves. The defect in drafting which I have highlighted may be small and easily corrected but its effect if it were not spotted would have been to drive a coach and four through the Government's Bill. The point must be that despite rigorous scrutiny in the Attorney General's Office, at the Cabinet sub-committee and at Government itself, and despite also the fact that this form of words has now been in the public domain for well over a fortnight, this error has so far gone unnoticed. What would have been the situation if it had entered into law? If this interpretation is correct, we would have ended up, possibly, with the most liberal abortion laws in western Europe. Whatever else this may be, the Bill does not amount to an attempt to deal comprehensively, even in terms of a criminal statute, with the protection of life in the womb. Leaving aside the issue of abortion for the moment, the Legislatures of most other common law jurisdictions have recognised the deficiencies of the criminal law in identifying and punishing threats to unborn life. If this legislation was truly attempting to fulfil a constitutional imperative to defend unborn human life, it would make an attempt, as has been done in other countries, to update and reform our homicide rules so as to close the identifiable loopholes that have given rise to difficulties elsewhere and are bound to do so here. If this opportunity were taken we would be enacting rules of law to clarify the circumstances in which liability under the law of homicide is imposed in respect of a variety of acts done before or during childbirth. What we have here is a Bill that is legally and constitutionally flawed. It is one that attempts to reduce the right to life of women. It does nothing to tackle the daily reality of so many thousands of Irish women who travel abroad to seek the help they are denied at home. It seeks to overturn the decision made by the Irish people in 1992, a free decision exercised in this independent Republic in which we are happy to live. Like many other people, I watched the funerals of Kevin Barry and his comrades that took place [52] recently. These men fought and died to give us independence and freedom. They helped to create this Republic. Thanks to them we live as a free people enjoying our prosperity and our new found confidence. Their sacrifice was made in order that we could win self-determination over our destiny and could build a State that would meet the needs of our citizens and reflect our dreams and ambitions. We take pride in that independence and in our success as a country. Yet for thousands of Irish citizens Fianna Fáil has only one answer. Despite that great tradition, for these thousands of Irish citizens, it has one answer when the question is raised. The answer is this: when you are in a crisis, when you are desperate and in need do not turn to us for assistance. Far from meeting their needs this great Republican party offers only one solution to these Irish citizens – take yourselves off to the old enemy. Britain will provide you with the safe professional help that we deny you. English doctors will provide the care for Irish women, even when their lives depend upon it. Fianna Fáil wants to protect the right to travel and will let Irish citizens travel. Hopefully they have the price of the fare because if they cannot afford to travel, as many women cannot, that is hard luck. Essentially, that is the Irish solution to the Irish problem. It is not a new one but what is being done in this Bill is to restrict further the rights of Irish women. When this Bill becomes part of public discourse and young people have an opportunity for the first time to debate the reality of abortion and when those hidden repressed voices of women who have had this experience are finally heard then we shall have a real debate and will have to face hard realities. Instead of that domineering bullying that is encompassed in the Bill we will get the truth about women dealing with crises in their lives that no man ever has to deal with. I look forward to that debate. I spent time at the hearings of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Those hearings were valuable in terms of providing much information in a methodical and orderly fashion. We heard from men from religious bodies and from men from the legal profession. A few women were present but not one Irish woman felt brave, secure or comfortable enough to tell us her story and to talk about her life experience. What is it like to be 22 years of age, in an unplanned, unexpected pregnancy and without support and being told to go away to another country where you will know nobody to get the professional help you seek? I heard one woman who felt secure enough talk about this at a meeting. She said she got the information on how to get an abortion off the toilet door in the ladies' lavatory in Trinity College. Fortunately, her boyfriend was supportive and helped her to go because she knew she wanted an abortion. While people may talk about social abortions or theological abortions, women will have abortions. This young woman went to Britain. When she was leaving after the procedure was over the [53] doctor put her on a course of antibiotics which worried her. She asked the doctor if she had an infection to which he replied: 'No, but you are Irish. We give all the Irish girls a dose of antibiotics because they do not go back to their doctors when they go home and the risk of an infection is much greater as a result'. That is the reality of abortion, not what is contained in the Bill or notions about restricting the right to life of women. If the referendum is held, I believe it will ultimately be defeated. However, I hope the benefits of the referendum campaign will be that the truth will emerge, that we will discuss the reality as it is experienced by thousands of citizens and that we will begin to confront that reality as legislators and as parents with a responsibility towards the younger generation.;3238240

1692;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im. Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Willie O'Dea;Fianna Fáil;I did not interrupt anyone on the Opposition side. Members should, therefore, do me the courtesy of allowing me to have my say and I will reciprocate. Whatever one may think of the Supreme Court judgment in the X case, there is widespread agreement with the observation of Mr. Justice McCarthy that nine years after the 1983 referendum had been passed by the Irish people the delay in introducing legislation to flesh out the implications of that amendment to the Constitution was not only unfortunate but inexcusable. Those remarks had considerable force in 1992 but they have even greater force now and the strength of their import increases with each day that passes. The Governments which came to power following the 1983 referendum, including that in which Deputy Dukes played a prominent role, could, from one point of view, be accused of cowardice in failing to deal with this matter. The Government of which Deputy Dukes was a member was succeeded by a minority Fianna Fáil Administration and, subsequently, one dominated by Fianna Fáil. It is true to say that, in 1992, the then Fianna Fáil led Government made an attempt to tackle this issue by way of constitutional amendment. Unsurprisingly, that attempt was not successful. However, this was not, as Deputy McManus [54] would have us believe, because everybody in Ireland suddenly decided that the judgment in the X case was wonderful and should be supported by two thirds of the people. Deputies will recall the charged atmosphere in which the debate took place in 1992 and, in my view, the main characteristic of that debate was that matters were misunderstood. The Government's attempt to explain to the people what it was attempting to do at that point was marred by misunderstanding. People, including some members of the clergy, who advertised themselves as 'pro-life', represented to the Irish people – particularly those who saw themselves as enlightened and liberal – that the Government of the day was trying to impose a regime similar to the current Taliban regime in Afghanistan. We were accused of using the law to impose the religious mores of a certain section of society on the population as a whole. That is what people who liked to think of themselves were led to believe. On the other hand, those who regarded themselves as pro-life were led to believe, particularly by some of their spiritual advisers, that what was about to engulf the country was a tidal wave of abortion and that the Government of the day was using the amendment to the Constitution as a fig leaf designed to create an illusion that it was trying to take action when in reality it could not do so. The circumstances in which the current proposal is being brought forward could hardly be more different. The Minister has outlined the exhaustive process of consultation, deliberation, analysis, study, etc., which has led, during the past four years and three months, to this proposal being advanced. The arguments in the interim have centred around what type of response would be appropriate, namely, should we just legislate or was it necessary to have another constitutional amendment? The situation was seen as a dichotomy – there would either be one or the other. The people who advanced both arguments were wrong. Those who advocated a simple constitutional amendment were wrong because it has now been demonstrated beyond argument that inserting a simple, direct phrase into the Constitution will not resolve this problem because it is far too complex. I served as a Minister of State in the Government which introduced the constitutional amendment in 1992 and I recall that people on the pro-life side, who had access to extremely good legal advice, submitted many different phrases to the Attorney General's office but, alas, they were always informed that if these phrases were considered in a certain way, the Supreme Court could arrive at a judgment similar to that which it reached in the X case. In my opinion, those who argue for a legislative response without constitutional amendment are equally wrong for two reasons. The first of these – Deputy Gay Mitchell recognised it – is people's belief that this issue is too important to be left solely to the legislators. I believe it was Lloyd George who said that war was too important a matter to be left to the generals and [55] the people believe – I tend to agree with them – that this matter is too important to be left solely to legislators.;3238246

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Willie O'Dea;Fianna Fáil;I agree with Deputy Mitchell that there is a legitimate concern abroad that if a matter is dealt with by the House simply by way of legislation it will be open to change in the future – this is particularly true when one considers what might be the Government of the day and on whom it might be obliged to rely for support – without any reference to the people. The latter are saying that this matter is so fundamental and important that it should be referred back to them in the event of any changes being made. In my view, that is a perfectly reasonable proposition. There is another reason for constitutional intervention in this matter. I disagree with the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case. Unlike certain parties in this House, I am prepared to state my position in unequivocal terms. I fundamentally disagree with the notion that the threat or possibility of suicide should be a ground for allowing an abortion – the deliberate destruction of a human foetus – to take place in this jurisdiction. That is my sincere, genuine and honest belief. Even if we legislated for this matter and put in place what could be regarded as safeguards, we will be obliged to rely on the subjective of a practitioner in a field of science which is, let us face it, quite inexact. One can measure whether a woman's life is in physical danger – that has been accepted and is current medical practice – but it is impossible to ever objectively measure whether somebody is going to commit suicide. The Minister has already outlined that fact. Deputy McManus painted a heart-rending picture of somebody's daughter who was raped, who had an unwanted pregnancy and who, perhaps, did not have the fare to travel to England and stated that we would condemn her to the possibility of committing suicide. The Minister referred to the relevant statistics in some detail and they prove that if we provide for suicide as the basis for somebody to seek an abortion, at some stage – it has not happened yet and I will explain why in a moment – there is a strong probability that we will eventually have in Ireland a regime of abortion on demand. The Minister indicated the number of abortions carried out in the UK last year because pregnant mothers said that they felt suicidal and their assertions were accepted. Is anybody in a position to say the number of cases in which what these women said was [56] not true? How many innocent unborn lives were destroyed because this was part of the law in Britain? People will say that this is the law as a result of the Supreme Court decision in the X case and there has been no rush to avail of it in the sense that people have presented themselves to their medical practitioners and stated they are suicidal and, therefore, require an abortion. The reality is, however, that this would be a fruitless exercise as matters stand. The existing code of ethics of the Irish medical profession is, in my opinion, the only thing that stands between the current legal position in this country and a slide into a situation where one has abortion on demand. There is no situation in a crisis pregnancy where certain action has to be taken and where one can have total and absolute mathematical equality of the life of the mother and that of the child. If the life of the mother is in mortal physical danger, then certain actions have to be taken even if that inevitably results in the death of the child. However, saying that is not inconsistent with saying that we must afford the greatest possible measure of protection to both the mother and the child in a pregnancy. It is my contention and the view of the Government that the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case did not provide for that. The state of the law as a result of the decision in the X case exposes innocent unborn life in this country to a mortal danger. The only matter standing in the way of that danger becoming a reality is the current code of practice, and I stress the word 'current', of the Irish medical profession. As Deputy Gay Mitchell said, that can change and is liable to do so. That temporary barrier would be further weakened by further legislation based on the flawed judgment of the Supreme Court. Any political party which is willing to sit back and allow the medical profession to stand in the way of something it cannot face up to is being dishonest. Any Government which would allow that situation to continue indefinitely is hardly worthy of the name.;3238250

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Willie O'Dea;Fianna Fáil;Deputy Dukes is not the only person in the House who can understand legislation, though he may think so. The Opposition response to this matter is curious to say the least. In 1992, the Labour Party adopted as a policy position that it believed in legislation to bring the effect of the X case into law. Suddenly the Labour Party found itself in Government. It was not just part of one Government but two, though it became part of the second by accident. The life of either Government could not have carried on without the [57] Labour Party but nothing was done. I was Minister of State in one of those Governments and I say without equivocation that the issue of dealing with the Supreme Court judgment in accordance with pre-Government Labour Party policy was never even mooted. There was not a tittle about it. When grasping the nettle was mooted, the Labour Party proved more elusive than Macavity the Mystery Cat. It ran away from it faster than the British Army at the Battle of New Orleans. It did not want to hear about it. That was its attitude when it had a chance to do something about it. Deputy McManus made a heartrending speech about an unfortunate girl who was raped and pregnant she could not go to England and she could be somebody's daughter. That unfortunate girl would have had no recourse to any medical treatment in Ireland during the Labour Party's time in office. The code of medical ethics of the Irish medical profession dictated that and it could only have been changed by legislation. Why did the Labour Party not change that by way of legislation? Why did it not provide for that imagined poor unfortunate when they were in Government for four and a half years?;3238254

It then advocated that the next Government should do what it had run away from and that it would reserve for itself the right to criticise the Government for doing what it had consistently, and with intent aforethought, funked and avoided for four and a half years. That is not a very edifying spectacle for a party that is supposed to represent a certain point of view nor is it a very ethical posture. The recent Labour Party conference passed a motion, if I interpret the English language correctly, looking for an abortion regime in this country which would literally constitute abortion on demand. Deputy McManus was asked about this on television. Let us recall that Deputy McManus was, in her previous incarnation, a member of Democratic Left, which is now sadly expired, and was very liberal on abortion. Her views were exactly in line with the motion passed by the Labour Party conference. Yet she stated on television that she voted against that motion. Why has she changed policy? We have seen much emotion and nit-picking and heard argument about the details of words. What we have not heard is where Labour or Fine Gael stand on this issue. I will be as charitable as I can to the Fine Gael position, as the people in [58] their wisdom have not elected that party to Government for 20 years.;3238258

We have had four and a half years of deliberation, in which Fine Gael participated. We have [59] parsed, analysed, debated, deliberated and agonised over this for four and a half years. Much of that took place in the full view of the nation on television. What is the Fine Gael response at the end of the day? It wants three more months. Is the main Opposition party so bereft of policies and ideas that it has to advance such threadbare arguments? I always listen carefully to Deputy Mitchell because I have great respect for him. His opposition to the Bill consisted of stating that a medical practitioner is not defined as registered the Supreme Court would have more scope for interpretation the fine was unspecified the press conference was hurriedly and unexpectedly called, after four and a half years the type of records to be kept by medical practitioners are not sufficiently defined and if something is not illegal, does that mean it is legal? That is the level of the main Opposition party. Deputy Mitchell's final shot was that this is flawed and that we should not be protecting legislation with the Constitution because if the legislation turns out to be flawed, one will need another referendum to change it. If one took that argument to its logical conclusion we should never amend the Constitution, as the wording of the amendment might be flawed and we would need a referendum to change that. To take it further to its illogical conclusion, we should not have a written Constitution at all because something in it might subsequently turn out to be flawed and we would need a referendum to change it. All branches of the medical profession have expressed support for this Government proposal. That is not surprising either because I know the medical profession was confused by the uncertainty about the state of the law. That caused great worry among the profession, and among pregnant women, many of whom were suffering sufficient distress already. That aspect is one on which even the Opposition, in its confusion and in its search for a stance, should agree with us and which it should welcome.;3238269

The main public criticism – I take no notice of the Opposition because I have described its performance – by commentators has been to accuse the Government of a NIMBY approach – not in my back yard. They say there are 6,500 unfortunates who went to England last year for abortions and the Government is willing to let them off while it continues whistling past the graveyard, but the fact is that the logical conclusion of what they are saying is that since this is happening near us and all [60] around the world, we should introduce it immediately. There are many things which we have democratically decided should be illegal here which are legal elsewhere. The right to travel is absolute. We do not – nor, in practice, could we – put up road blocks or checkpoints to stop people travelling out of this country on the basis that we think, feel or suspect that they are going to do something legally abroad which they cannot do legally here.;3238271

The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, stated: The Government has concluded that there is no simple sentence or paragraph that can be inserted into the Constitution which, by itself, would amount to a balanced, effective, legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy. I agree. The Minister is entirely correct. However, what the Government has done is to bring in an excessively complex mechanism, an amendment to the Constitution and the text of a Bill, a Bill within a Bill, which the Oireachtas can [61] either pass or reject, but not amend.

I do not expect the Government to produce satisfactory reasons for the many aspects of this Bill, the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, which I find objectionable. I say that having very carefully read and re-read the Taoiseach's responses to the 34 questions which Deputy Noonan posed on the various issues arising. I do not for a moment believe the Taoiseach drafted these responses, but he has set his name to them and made them his own. I assume the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General had substantial roles to play also in the drafting of those responses. That worries me because I find both the formulation and the tone of those responses deeply disturbing. A strong streak of misogyny runs through those responses. At no point do they show any understanding of the concerns of a woman in what we now call a 'crisis pregnancy'. Still less do these responses show any compassion. The whole tone is mechanical, cold, technocratic and dismissive of any hint of emotion. These responses are clearly based on the proposition that hard cases make bad law. They totally ignore the equally valid proposition – we have a full illustration of it in the context of this Bill – that bad law makes hard cases. God knows, we should have learned that by now in this context. As I read it, the Bill sets out to do three things directly and one thing indirectly. It sets out directly: to define abortion to remove from the Constitution the provision that a risk of self-destruction can be a ground for abortion and to give legislative – we could call it 'quasi-constitutional'– cover to current medical practices in relation to the termination of pregnancy. It sets out indirectly to legalise the use of the 'morning after' pill and IUDs. I am not at all convinced that we need a referendum to define abortion, as it is defined in this Bill, to give legislative cover to current medical practice or to permit the use of the 'morning after' pill and IUDs. Each of those three things could be done within the framework of the Constitution, as it stands, by appropriate legislative action. I reject the Government's contention that a constitutional amendment is necessary to do these things, since it amounts to nothing less than a capitulation to the lobby which has contended for 20 years that legislators cannot be trusted on these issues. This, we should remember, is the same lobby which got even the presentation of its own case entirely wrong in 1982, which rejected [62] advice about the potential effects of its actions and which, ever since, has been endeavouring to find a way of rectifying that mistake without once admitting the error in the first place. I reject that view. I reject the Government's capitulation to it. I reject the Government's attempt in this Bill to fetter the Houses of the Oireachtas by presenting to them the text of a Bill which they can either accept or reject, but not amend. I reject the idea that any future amendment to the proposed Bill can be effected only by a further referendum. This Government is proposing that the Houses of the Oireachtas abdicate their constitutional functions in this matter. I did not get elected to come in here to abdicate my functions in that way.;3238278

1726;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im. Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;I want to contrast that with the proposal in this Bill within a Bill to allow the Government to do certain things by Order. The Minister told us this morning that these Orders are in a form where they can be rejected by a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days of their being passed. I have been a Member of this House for more than 20 years. Not once have I ever seen an Order Paper of this House which contained a reference or a proposal to debate an Order made by any Government in that form. It is only by being put on the Order Paper by the Government that such an Order can be debated. There are reasons for making those Orders in certain cases they are far more limited than the current practice. In the case of this Bill, I can guarantee that if that is passed, no Order on foot of that made by any Government, especially if it is of the mind set of the present Government, will ever have a snowball's chance in hell of coming before this House to be debated. Therefore, the provision which states that this House can have some function in that is entirely unreal. The definition of abortion in this Bill within a Bill could be by way of a straightforward amendment to the relevant sections of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. In the Government's response to Question No. 8 posed by Deputy Michael Noonan, I find the statement: Section 2 replaces the existing criminal offence of 'procuring a miscarriage' which is provided for in Section 58 and Section 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. There is nothing to prevent the Government from proposing the necessary amendment to that Act. Such an amendment would fall perfectly within the function of legislation as envisaged in Article 40. 3.3 of the Constitution as it stands. If that amendment were made to the 1861 Act it would have the same effect in relation to the use of the morning after pill and IUDs as the infinitely more complex measure now proposed by the Government. It is the definition of abortion contained in the Bill within a Bill which removes any doubt as to the legality of the morning after [63] pill and IUDs. The same effect would be achieved by a simple amendment to the 1861 Act. The Government claims the effect of section 2(2) of the Bill within a Bill is to give legislative cover to currently accepted medical practice. On the face of it, that is true. As with the definition of abortion, it seems that the same effect could be achieved by inserting this subsection, or most of it, into an amendment to the 1861 Act we would get exactly the same effect by a straightforward amendment to the 1861 Act. In fact, the measure proposed by the Government is not quite as clear as it pretends. It gives legislative cover to whatever happens to be the currently agreed ethical standards adopted by the medical profession at any given time. If we do what the Government proposes, we will not simply give legislative cover to a defined set of standards in force today, we will give legislative and, indeed, quasi-constitutional cover to whatever those standards happen to be at the time of the passage of the legislation and to any changes that might subsequently be agreed by the medical profession, whether those changes be in either a more liberal or in a more conservative direction. The Government proposes that we hand over an unknowable power to the medical profession to decide what those standards would be. It is a blank cheque to the medical profession, which is not a desirable way to proceed. I do not say this out of any distrust or disrespect for the medical profession, quite the contrary. I do not believe that this Legislature should pass such a burden to the ethical mentors of the medical profession. Why does the Government not propose, for example, to enshrine in legislation the currently accepted formulation of accepted practice by the medical profession? Why does the Government not enshrine such a formulation in legislation which can, if necessary, and on the advice of the medical profession, be amended in the ordinary way in the ordinary course of legislation with which we deal daily in this House? The answer is that the Government is afraid to take on its responsibilities and that it has caved in to pressure groups who, in the face of their own mistakes, still insist that legislators cannot be trusted. The Government's proposal is both a debasement and a perversion of the proper role of the Legislature. The Government wants to roll back the basis of the 'X' case. Nowhere in the 20 page response to Deputy Noonan's 34 questions is there any indication that the Government has any understanding of, or sympathy for, what must have been a deeply traumatic experience for the young woman involved in that case. The Government's comment on this in the framework of the response to Question No. 7 is to say, in relation to the threat of suicide constituting a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother: . . . it is noteworthy that the only occasions upon which it has ever been suggested that threat or risk of suicide was a justification for having an abortion within the State were [64] occasions upon which individual women were being prevented against their wishes from exercising the freedom to travel to another State. The Minister repeated that this morning. That must be one of the most chillingly unsympathetic statements I have seen in this context for many years. That particular response goes on to say: The Government's proposals have been specifically drafted with a view to ensuring that the non-recognition of the risk of suicide as a ground for a lawful termination of the life of the unborn in Ireland does not result in persons who would otherwise be free to travel abroad being refused permission in any circumstances by any Court exercising personal jurisdiction over them from doing so. That is a hell of a mouthful of a sentence. The Government is saying that its answer to a suicidal disposition on the part of a young woman with a crisis pregnancy is to say to that woman, 'buy a ticket to England'. I find that absolutely appalling. The Government's response goes on further: There is nothing in the proposed amendment or in the envisaged legislation which would render it illegal for a health board to assist a woman to travel outside the jurisdiction in such a case. That is true. There is equally nothing in the proposals that would oblige a health board to assist.;3238280

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;It is worth noting that there is a clear implication that a health board can form a judgment on the reality of suicidal intent – otherwise why would the Government be talking about this – something which the Government suggests it cannot or should not do itself. There is here an implicit admission of the Government's disingenuousness in the presentation of its case. It is clear that the Government does not trust anything that might be said about her state of mind by a woman in a crisis pregnancy. That is why it intends to remove the suicidal intent basis from the Constitution. That is made very clear in the Government's response to Question No. 14 from Deputy Noonan where it is stated that it is the Government's view that: . . . the medical consensus in the medical profession is the only thing which now stands between us and the de facto introduction of 'social abortion' in this country. The legislative vacuum which now exists must be filled. If legal provision were made for suicide risk, a system of psychiatric assessment and court supervision would, almost inevitably, follow. If that were to happen, even if it were initially done on a narrow basis, the scene would be set for a gradual introduction of 'social abortion' in Ireland. [65] What that says is that it is the Government's belief that women with crisis pregnancies and their psychiatric assessors would systematically and falsely claim suicidal intent in order to secure abortions. Such a view would be perfectly consistent with the streak of misogyny that runs all the way through the Government's responses to these questions.;3238282

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;It also displays a fine contempt for a particular branch of the medical profession. Furthermore, it ignores the fact that, notwithstanding the judgment in the 'X' case, there has not been any evident disposition to seek abortions here on the ground of suicidal intent, in accordance with the jurisprudence. Although the law and jurisprudence state that the ground available in the 'X' case is available to women here, nothing is being provided. Even if someone were to request an abortion on those grounds the service is not being made available. It is clear the Government has set its mind against taking the word of a pregnant woman or her psychiatric assessor. The reference in the passage which I have just quoted to 'court supervision' is, I suppose, understandable. What is not understandable – rather entirely deplorable – is the tone of the response by the Government to Deputy Noonan's Question No. 16, 'What will be the position of a woman who is pregnant as a result of rape under this legislation?' The response to that question contains a series of legalistic questions which are described in the Government's response as 'very human issues', but which make no reference to the feelings of the woman in the case or to the fact already well known – the Minister of State can quote chapter and verse on this – that there is abundant evidence that many cases of rape go unreported because the victims cannot contemplate the idea of adding further trauma to what they have already suffered. The Government chooses simply to dismiss all that and say it is not a relevant consideration in anything we do about the law or the Constitution in this regard. As far as I can determine, the Government's case for rolling back the judgment in the X case rests solely and entirely on the proposition that in some way the X case opens the way for what the Government chooses to call social abortion. The term 'social abortion' is a new one to me and one which I believe will be deeply offensive to many women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies. It is another sign of the Government's callousness that it seems to make no distinction between women who are emotionally traumatised to the point of feeling suicidal as a result of a crisis pregnancy and what I suspect is a small minority of women in affluent western societies who unwisely choose to treat abortion as another form of contraception. There are countries and there have been [66] regimes in the world where it was not uncommon for women to undergo a series of abortions during their lives.;3238284

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;Thank you, Sir. The political and social frameworks of those countries and regimes are and were vastly different from the society in which we live. All that I have read and heard about conditions in those societies and regimes indicates that, in the final analysis, women who found themselves having a series of abortions never undertook them lightly and were seriously traumatised by the complex of issues surrounding their individual cases. That has been the case, and may still be to some extent, in much of central and eastern Europe and Russia, and it is still the case in China. In all those cases, poverty, the lack of easy access to practical methods of contraception and low educational standards were important factors in determining behaviour. In some cases, political repression is or was a major factor. In all cases, most women felt they had little choice in the matter. Most are traumatised to a greater or lesser degree. Very few of the people who have experienced it would view what the Government chooses to call social abortion as a desirable norm and there are very few cases in the developed western world where there is any substantial body of opinion that would propose what the Government chooses to dismiss as social abortion as a norm. Since the matters the Government sets out to do in this complicated proposal other than the rollback of the X case can be done by legislation, the honest thing for the Government to do, if it really wants to roll back the X case, would be simply to propose an amendment to modify Article 40. 3.3º accordingly. In that way, the electorate would be faced with a very clear issue rather than the complex matters raised in this Bill. I have no doubt that the electorate would be capable of dealing with that question, especially if we were in a position where the definition of abortion, the protection of current medical practice and the use of the morning after pill and IUDs had already been dealt with by legislation. As it happens, the electorate rejected such a proposal in 1992 but if the Government is serious [67] and honest about what it wants to do, it will put that proposal again. In choosing the complex formula which is before us, the Government has unnecessarily obscured the real issues. It has proposed a legislative and constitutional monster which could, in the future, be prayed in aid by any group, which, like the sponsors of the original pro-life amendment, decides that it knows better and is more to be trusted than legislators duly elected in democratic, constitutional general elections.;3238290

It is a reasonable, sensitive and intelligent way of dealing with an issue which has caused great concern and anxiety over a number of years. It is a move which has been a long time coming. In the view of many people, the process to get to this point has been very slow but there has been a great deal of consultation, which the Minister outlined this morning, including the Green Paper, the All-party Committee on the Constitution and the Cabinet sub-committee. It was a long and slow procedure but it was well worthwhile in that all political, medical and other representatives in society were given the opportunity to be involved and to give their point of view. I do not know if we can ever please the Opposition. For years we were told that this was a complex medical and social issue and that no simple measure can solve the problem, yet when the Government comes forward with a proposal, after deep consideration, Deputy Dukes says it is not necessary and that it could be done by way of a simple amendment to the 1861 legislation. The Government policy has been deeply thought out. The legislation enshrined in the constitutional amendment and the setting up of the caring agency takes account of the best views that have come forward, specifically from the all-party Oireachtas committee. The people who pushed for the 1983 referendum were against the introduction of widespread abortion in the country. While that referendum has been criticised by many people since—;3238293

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Noel Ahern;Fianna Fáil;There are people in the legal profession who always seem to have an agenda, but perhaps their job is to come up with difficult questions that have not been thought of previously. The decision of the people in the 1983 referendum was clear and there was no doubt about what people wanted. They wanted to outlaw abortion while recognising the equal right to life of the mother. Many people believe abortion to be the great scourge of our time. Many have strong religious views on it but outside of that it is a major human rights issue. It amazes me that people who are champions of human rights in regard to issues in different parts of the world do not regard the protection of the life of the unborn as a human rights issue. It is a human rights issue and I very much welcome this decision. The X case decision was amazing to the people who voted for that referendum in 1983 and thought they had given a very clear view. Accepting that the courts are there to interpret the laws, people still found it extraordinary to be told that, when they voted one way, they really meant to vote the opposite way. Why do people criticise the principle of going to the people in a referendum? Allowing the people to choose rather than operating entirely by legislation is the exercise of democracy in its purest form. I cannot understand the position of those who say that the voters have to be saved from themselves, that somebody else on high knows better. Why do some people try to avoid a referendum, which is the purest form of democracy? The Labour Party amendment, particularly section (f2>c), opposes the Government Bill on the grounds that it seeks to overturn the decision taken by the people in 1992 upholding the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case. While I accept that in 1992 people from both sides voted against that referendum, the interpretation which Deputy McManus is putting on it is quite ridiculous in trying to claim credit for that defeat and saying that was the decision of the people. That measure was defeated in 1992 because a majority of the people on the pro-life side saw it as limited abortion at the time.;3238298

Perhaps we are all more enlightened nine years later and perhaps we now realise it is not just a pure 'Yes' and 'No' situation. For that, we can thank the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which invited in the medical people and others concerned to tease out these issues, as a result of which certain clarifications emerged and some of the easy phrases or black and white interpretations being used previously were dispelled. I am pleased with the initial response and support of the mainstream pro-life groups to this Government proposal. I know there are some on, as it were, the pure pro-life side who are not fully happy. Within my parliamentary party, I see myself as slightly on the conservative side, though some people might label me as being slightly more to the right. I hope we can bring people to see that this is a very fair-minded and enlightened measure by the Government. It is very much a middle-of-the-road position. If passed it will provide a good defensible position to hold back the slide towards social abortion. It is ridiculous to complain that it does not outlaw the morning after pill. No Government would ever consider doing so. People on the extreme wing of that movement who take that view and who want an ultimate yes or no may as well support the Taliban because that is the only kind of politician likely to take that rather ridiculous position. The Labour Party has a position on the matter and is adhering to an annual conference motion. It has stated loudly and clearly that it believes in pro-choice, the right of a woman to choose. I am against that position, but at least Labour is adhering to a stated position. Some, including my constituency colleague from the Labour Party, have very quickly run away from that position but Deputy McManus is clearly proclaiming a definite position. Fine Gael, on the other hand, does not seem to have a position. Basically, according to its amendment, that party wants the issue stalled for three months so its members can have more time to make up their minds. (Interruptions.);3238301

To quote a recent statement by President Bush in another context, 'on some of these matters, you are either with us or against us'. It is up to Fine Gael people to make up their minds and let us know where they stand. The Government has taken the right position. It is a very complex issue and it is difficult to get a balanced view on it. In 1983, the Supreme Court was critical of the Oireachtas, in that, after the referendum, we did not introduce legislation or even consider the matter. The present approach of having a referendum in which the legislation is included will give people great trust. That is the basis for the Constitution. We do not go to the people on a daily or weekly basis on every decision or legislative measure but people like to have a say on certain fundamental matters. The Government is now giving the people that opportunity by attaching the legislation for their consideration. That is a very far-seeing move, perhaps following the headline of the Good Friday legislation. The people will know that the legislation cannot be changed without it being referred back to them. The measure in the Bill is not new. It was the third option in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which had discussed it for many months. It protects both women and the unborn in pregnancy and it accommodates all existing medical practices. It gives complete protection to medical procedures which are necessary to avoid risks. The medical profession sought such legislation. They were concerned about the possibility of legal proceedings being taken against them for doing what they are good at – protecting the life of the mother and the unborn child. Medical people were being quoted rightly or wrongly by different groups. The all-party committee did considerable good by questioning those people and determining there is a small number of very rare cases where medical treatment is necessary to save the life of a woman. That will now be protected by this measure. I would not call that abortion. It is a medical procedure necessary to save the life of the mother. However, at least we now have the medical people saying the same thing and they cannot be misquoted by extreme groups on either side. I was somewhat bemused by Deputy Dukes saying he is opposed to the Government measure. He suddenly claims that we could solve this prob[71] lem by an amendment to the 1861 Act. If life were that simple, it is incredible that no Government took that measure in the past 20 years. It is reasonable for society to want to lay down rules or guidelines on what it wants of society. Nobody is perfect. I listened to Deputy Liz McManus this morning. While people may speak with passion, I hope this debate is carried out in a calm and reasonable manner. It is a very sensitive, emotive and personal issue.;3238307

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Noel Ahern;Fianna Fáil;In every walk of life, we all have our aims and hopes. We would like to think we can live up to those aspirations but we never know until a crisis reaches our door. I would like to think that in this or another walk of life, I could live by my deeply held principles but nobody can be absolutely sure of that. That is not hypocrisy and does not take from the sincerity of people or their right to have their aspirations enshrined in law or the Constitution. This is a very sensitive issue and not just for women. Those who claim men have no right to speak on an issue are very often the people who complain that men are not involved in family matters including the rearing and education of their children. I am not suggesting that I am the greatest father in the world – I am not. However, we are all members of society and we all have a right to our views on this matter, although I accept it fundamentally affects women. When women face crisis pregnancies one would like to think the men involved would be supportive, but sadly in some cases they are not. The Government is setting up an agency to deal with crisis pregnancies. This proves the issue is being dealt with in a very broad comprehensive way by Government. I hope the debate will be calm and this legislation and the referendum will be passed. If so I think it will settle matters for the next 20 to 25 years.;3238313
1760;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im. Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;Since 2 October when the Government very unexpectedly published this legislation, I have been beset with a variety of emotions. My first emotions were anger, annoyance and frustration that the Government was to put us through the difficulties of having another referendum, given that the country has spoken twice, in 1983 and in 1992. I moved on to fear and emotion for those women who would be talked about in a way that we have heard already in the House today and will continue to hear as this debate progresses. These are women who every day either make the lonely journey to England to have an abortion or make the decision to keep a pregnancy that may cause them huge difficulty. These include pregnancies caused perhaps by rape, incest or some other horrendous action and possibly influenced by their own mental infirmity. Today, as I listened to some of the contributions in the House, I have moved back to a sense of anger. We do not need another referendum on this issue. I quote no higher authority than the Taoiseach in answer to a question from Deputy Michael Noonan, 'This does not mean that unborn human life as protected in the Constitution has been reduced as regards its scope'. If that is the Taoiseach's opinion, why are we having another referendum? We are doing so because the Government made up of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats was not satisfied by the answer given by the people in 1992 and it wants to go back – repeatedly if necessary – until it gets the answer it wants from the people. How insulting is that to the people? Deputy Noel Ahern said the people had the right to speak, and I agree. In 1992 the electorate faced three referenda. The people did not blindly vote 'yes' or 'no' to all three. They made targeted decisions on each issue. They agreed with the right to travel and information but disagreed with the rolling back of the Supreme Court decision on the X case. They made that decision and Deputy Ahern should not shake his head. What he is saying is if the Government puts the question in some other way, it will get the answer it wants and that the people were foolish and did not know what they were being asked. They knew what they were being asked and they said they did not want our laws to roll back the decision made where a 14 year old girl, as a result of rape, was suicidal and got the help she required from the courts. I say shame on this Government for going back on what the people said. I am angry today because what we are being asked to do is wrong primarily for that reason, but also for many other reasons. This is a cynical hypocritical exercise by the Government. It is merely political expediency to bring forth this mishmash of a constitutional referendum tied in with legislation that will tie the hands of us as elected representatives. The answers to the questions posed by my party leader are full of vague expressions, such as, 'it is hoped' and 'it is anticipated'. In his speech today the Minister [73] used similar language. The Government does not know, yet it is asking the House to pass this Bill. At the Government's press launch, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, said: 'I believe our debate should be proportionate'. It was a plea to us not to highlight the about turn by the Progressive Democrats. She went on to say: 'Let it be proportionate, particularly in the context of the grave international situation we are currently facing'. God forgive me for being reminded of what happened in the House of Commons where a Government adviser recommended that any bad news be made public while people were exercised with the atrocities in America. This issue has nothing to do with the international situation. In her address at the Government press launch the Minister of State went on to state: 'The legislation seeks to reach out to the consensus of the middle ground and, in our view, has the capacity to garner the support of reasonably minded people'. There is no mention of it seeking to assist women or to resolve legislative lacunae, rather she acknowledges the Government is seeking to get rid of the issue, not because it is proper to do so or because it has found the right formula by which to proceed but because it hopes to garner enough support from reasonably minded people. Speaking at the Government press launch, the Minister for Health and Children stated: 'We have considered ways of moving forward which can command the support of the people'. The job of the Government is to do what is right, not to proceed on the basis of having its proposals passed by a percentage of the electorate. It should put what it considers to be right before the people and should act only on that basis. It should not act on the basis of support it may get or on the basis that it will win brownie points because it has succeeded in amending the Constitution. I am very angry at the Government's cynicism. It is clear that the Government is acting because four Independent Deputies have demanded it. They are part of a motley crew, some of whom have acted with the best of intentions. Since 1983 they have continued to demand referenda until they get the answer they want, which does not include the saving of women's lives. Regardless of what some may say, when pregnant women are treated for a medical condition the foetus may die. The secondary effect of the treatment is an abortion and let us not pretend otherwise. The doctors and the Government are aware of the position. Some of that same motley crew gave very bad advice in 1983 and ended up with the opposite of what they intended. What they sought then was unnecessary. There was never a need for Article 40. 3.3º in the Constitution, as human life, born or unborn, was sufficiently protected by the Constitution and by our laws. Some of these people now say that this proposal is the right approach – some have yet to say it publicly – and the [74] Government has listened to them. The only concern is to garner their support. The removal of the threat of suicide as a ground for seeking an abortion, which the people decided they wanted to retain, is similar to society telling women that their bodies are divided at the neck. If implemented, this proposal will mean that women can seek medical treatment when their bodies require it but if their mental condition is suicidal they will have no rights. That is the most serious insult in the Bill. Four women Deputies are present in the House and I am surprised the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, could allow this to happen. The Government is proposing to give women who are suicidal, like the girl in the X case, two options: they can commit suicide or travel to England in their suicidal condition and make the necessary arrangements to have an abortion. It is tantamount to saying that society only wants to help women if their bodies are ill, not if they are mentally ill and that illness causes as much danger to life as, say, a carcinoma on the uterus. This is the most callous aspect of the Bill. The Bill is a gross insult to the profession of psychiatry. As elsewhere, psychiatrists in this country must undergo training and qualification as doctors. I am surprised the psychiatric profession has not been louder regarding the insult heaped upon it. In response to a question from Deputy Noonan, the Taoiseach advises that the only reason suicide is being removed as a reason for seeking an abortion is because it would require the establishment of a mechanism where psychiatrists would give advice on the suicidal condition of a woman and if that were included it would lead to what he terms 'social abortion'. How did the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, allow such a term to creep into speeches by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and other Members on the Government side of the House? It suggests that because women want to improve their figure to fit a new dress they will seek an abortion. My colleague, Senator Keogh, put it more graphically yesterday when she said it suggested that women might seek a 'social abortion' between painting their nails and having their hair done. There is no such thing as a social abortion. Women have abortions because they find themselves with unwanted pregnancies for all kinds of reasons but it is not because of social reasons, such as a social outing with work colleagues or embarking on a social trip to Liverpool to experience the new boat service from Dún Laoghaire. It is an offensive term and, as a woman, I am ashamed that any other woman, in this House or elsewhere, would allow the Government to accuse a suicidal woman, who might have to seek help from the courts to terminate her pregnancy, of allowing for the introduction of social abortion to this country. It is another reason I am so angry. [75] However, I reserve my highest level of anger and cynicism for the Progressive Democrats, especially in view of speeches made by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, and the Attorney General, Mr. McDowell, when he was a Member of this House. In his present role as Attorney General former Deputy McDowell is the chief legal adviser to the Government. I am appalled he would sanction the introduction of legislation such as this, which, as Deputy Dukes said, will fetter the Members of the House now and in the future. The courts have called on the Oireachtas to introduce legislation but if the Attorney General were a Member of this House he would be incandescent with rage if he thought a Government was removing his right to introduce legislation to this House. Yet, as Attorney General, he is recommending to the Government to do that. In response to a question from Deputy Noonan, the Taoiseach says it would intra vires introduce legislation. This means that we, the Members elected by the people, need the protection of the Constitution to tell us what legislation to introduce. How dare he. In 1995, when speaking on the legislation dealing with the right to information on abortion services, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who was then an Opposition spokesperson for her party, said: 'We will also table an amendment to take account of the X case, the hard cases and the rights of women for whom a pregnancy poses a risk to their lives'. Michael McDowell said, 'I completely reject the notion that any female is obliged to carry a pregnancy to a full term where conception was based on rape, incest or sexual abuse of a child.' My, how he has changed his tune. What care and concern does he have for the female obliged to carry a pregnancy for those reasons now? It has all gone out the window because of his pursuit of power and desire to be Attorney General and give the Government the advice he thinks will suit it. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, made some other choice comments in 1995. Talking about the X case she said, 'The further the facts of this case slip from our memory, the easier it is for the old absolutes to revive and gain credence.' How right she was and how easily she has forgotten she said that. She further said: The bringing of the X case marked an all-time low in the treatment of women with crisis pregnancies. It was perhaps the most shameful and disgraceful period in Irish public life since the foundation of the State. How she has forgotten that. She is the Minister of State out there selling the Progressive Democrats line. In 1995, speaking in the Dáil, she reminded us: There are interest groups at work in our society, powerful, secretive, manipulative and extremely well-funded interest groups, who will [76] spy on them [the doctors] and perhaps present as agent provocateurs in surgeries to try to trap doctors into making a recommendation which they believe is not truthful or objective. Those were her words in 1995, yet she now has the cheek to tell us she would like the debate to be proportionate. She would like it to be proportionate because she does not want us to remind her of what she said in 1995 out of care for women with unwanted pregnancies. Her sin in what she is doing now is the greatest of all because she is a woman – like many of us in the House – and has gone back on all she said. Both she and the Attorney General are people to whom the public will express its anger when it gets the opportunity to vote on this Bill. My anger was beginning to subside until I received a copy of the Taoiseach's replies to questions posed by Deputy Noonan. They are full of inconsistencies. He says it is not proposed to interpret or redefine the term 'unborn.' In a document distributed to the media when the Bill was being launched the Taoiseach said the term 'abortion' was being redefined. The Government is not redefining 'unborn,' but is defining when an abortion can take place, from conception, in one instance, and only after implantation in another. If it is not redefining the term 'unborn,' I do not know what it is doing. The unborn are not worthy of protection at conception, they are only worthy of it after implantation. What nonsense and twisting on the head of a pin that is. I cannot understand this. The Taoiseach says the Government's proposals will result 'it is hoped' in the enactment of a law which is clear as to its meaning and effects. In the light of Deputy Noonan's question, how is it anticipated that the Government's proposals will impinge on the rights of the unborn and the mother, which are already identified? It will not. It simply makes it constitutionally ultra vires for us to pass laws. That is no big deal and it shows the arrogance of the Attorney General that he would allow a Government to put that into law. At the same time the right of the constitutional office of the President to refer legislation to the courts, if he or she thinks it unconstitutional, is removed. The Taoiseach's answer regarding the definition of the word 'abortion' is as follows, 'The envisaged legislation, the terms of which are set out in the Second Schedule, defines the term 'abortion' for the purpose of that legislation only'. Think of the fun the Supreme Court will have. There will be one definition in one Act and another referring to another law only. The court will have to make its decisions based on this. In answer to question No. 8, the Taoiseach said it is far too difficult to deal with many of the issues because they are subject to philosophical, moral and theological discourse. For God's sake, [77] most of our theologians are men and, in many instances, members of the Church.;3238314

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;They exclude women and will never have to face the unwanted pregnancy of a partner, or should not as they are not meant to. By referring to philosophical, moral and theological discourse the Taoiseach is saying that this will be based on the considerations of those who have no right to make pronouncements on the pregnancies and unwanted pregnancies of women. The Government wants to put into the Constitution a provision which could be made, as Deputy Dukes said, by amending the 1861 Act or by introducing legislation ab initio in the Dáil for Members to discuss and amend as they see fit. In deference to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who is a doctor I will finish with a hypothesis. Can one imagine the outcry if we decided to legislate in this Bill for the operation of a vasectomy? If a man has a vasectomy, he is preventing a pregnancy from taking place. If the argument is stretched enough, it can be said that is an abortifacient operation because it is designed to prevent a man's sperm from managing to impregnate an ovum in a woman. If legislation were put in place regarding scrotum cancer which ruled that if a man had chemotherapy on his scrotum it would prevent him producing sperm and interfere with procreation, I can imagine the outcry. Imagine that was provided for not mere in legislation, but in the Constitution. Members of the Government should hang their heads in shame and tell the women they are appearing to try to help that they will give them what assistance they can to prevent crisis pregnancies. The Government should give them all the advice it can instead of treating them like idiots and dividing their bodies into two parts above and below the neck.;3238316

There can be very few issues facing any society that are as complex and challenging as the issue of abortion. In 1983 it was felt the people had put into the Constitution a clear and unambiguous statement providing protection for the life of the unborn, but that view was wrong. Within a few short years the Supreme Court completely reversed the generally accepted interpretation of the referendum result of 1983. With the X case and the subsequent C case further ambiguity was created. Therefore, it is incumbent on us, as a society, to address those ambiguities with the questions raised by those cases. The question of abortion is one on which there is no middle ground. It is by its very nature a divisive issue, one invariably discussed in emotional terms. Inevitably, those on either side of the debate try to demonise, misrepresent and shout down the opposing view. There are two diametrically opposed views, which deserve to be heard. Whatever else can be said about the current proposals, the point cannot be made legitimately that there has been any shortage of discussion of the issue in the past 15 years. We have had four and a half years of dis[79] cussion and analysis, along with a Green Paper and a report from an all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution, which considered a vast number of separate submissions. There is no excuse for politicians who do not know where we stand on the issue of abortion. There is no excuse for equivocation. There has not been a shortage of analysis and it is therefore surprising that a party with such a long and distinguished history as Fine Gael should seek to put the issue on the long finger. I cannot understand it.;3238331

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;M;Mr. Dick Roche;Fianna Fáil;Immediately following the general election the Taoiseach promised a referendum to be held during the lifetime of the current Dáil. He is now honouring that promise. In spite of the cynicism of the past four years it is astonishing that there has been some criticism of the fact that the Taoiseach has had the political courage to produce a comprehensive set of proposals at this time. It may be that others have better propositions in mind. If so, let them put them before us and we will listen to them. The proposals that have been published are comprehensive and compassionate. They afford the Irish people a further opportunity to make a clear and unambiguous statement as to where they stand on this most difficult issue. In addition to affording the people this opportunity, we are also challenging the people with these proposals, because they go further than previous propositions. They are not as simplistic as previous approaches, but complex. We all have to accept that. There is no single one-liner that will deal with this complex set of issues. I do not claim to have wisdom in abundance, and I may be wrong, but I do not believe that suggestions that the matter can be resolved by reverting to Victorian legislation and making some adjustments to it are of any worth. This would not be sufficient to return the Irish people to the position we believed we were in after 1983. In 1992, the Supreme Court in the X case ruled that the termination of pregnancy was lawful in this country when there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother. In other words, it introduced the issue of suicide. It is a very difficult issue to argue against. I accept that. All the arguments that have been put forward should be based on reason rather than emotion. Ultimately, some decision will have to be made on this issue. There is no option and no room for equivocation. The judgment in the X case introduced an extraordinary interpretation of what had been enacted by the Irish people as a pro-life constitutional amendment. Whether we agree or not with the amendment of 1983 is not the issue. The [81] Irish people in 1983 sought to include in their Constitution a provision to protect the life of the unborn child. Due to legal imperfections in the drafting – that is widely accepted by all sides in the argument—;3238348

Then we will know where she stands. At least allow me the democratic right to express the views of the constituents I represent. I represent a people who are pro-life, compassionate and who know the challenges. I do not come to the House to represent people who want to hide between equivocation and mud-stirring. I come to listen to the Deputy and put my points on the record and I hope that she will listen to me. To answer the last contributor, a referendum was held in 1992 in response to the High Court decision. It sought to provide for the termination of pregnancy if there was a real, substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother. We know the result of this referendum. We are currently faced with an extraordinary situation here. On the one hand, we have the expressed wish of the people that our Constitution should be unequivocally pro-life. On the other hand, as a result of the judgment and the failure of legislators to deal with the issue, not just in this Dáil but in previous Dáils, we could theoretically have had widely available abortion in the country without any kind of regulation. That is a fact. The only thing protecting the people from having an abortion system more open than anywhere else in the world – I was almost going to use the term 'liberal' but there is nothing liberal about abortion – is the ethical standard being applied by the medical profession. However, that is not good enough. We need finality. The idea that, somehow or other, the issue can be avoided seems to be the most dangerous approach of all. I have some respect for people in the Labour Party who have said they are pro-choice and in favour of abortion on demand. I do not agree with that policy but I respect their right to put it forward. I cannot understand or respect people who want to do the same, but will not, and [82] people who are pro-life, but are frightened to say so. We must come down from the fence and make decisions. As the Members know, following the election of 1997, the Taoiseach indicated that a Green Paper would be published after he took up office. It was published is September 1999. On publication it was referred to the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution. There was significant cynicism about that at the time and a great deal of criticism. There were many suggestions to the effect that we should have handled the issue shortly after the Green Paper but that, somehow, the Government ducked the issue by referring it to the joint committee. That committee did an extraordinarily good job. I regret that there could not be solutions at the end but, given the nature of an all-party committee, that was always going to be the way. The committee conducted the most elaborate and comprehensive consultation process ever seen in the history of the nation. In all, more than 100,000 submissions were received from various organisations and individuals. At that stage the cynics said there should be some decision in this matter to give it finality. When there was a further protracted process of consultation with people before the report was published, that was also criticised. However, the approach taken by the joint committee was the right one. It allowed people to talk through the various sides of the argument and provided much more light and much less heat than some of what passes for political debate on this issue. The joint committee published its report on 15 November 2000 and again the cynics and critics asked the Government why it did not produce a response. The current proposal is based on the work of the joint committee. The Government examined the three possible approaches suggested by the committee and devised a very complex response which, nonetheless, is the only option which can be availed of and, I point out to political critics, the only one on offer. All sides of the House have had more than adequate time to consider the complexities, ambiguities and dangers which have arisen as a result of the X case, and all have failed to date to address them.;3238355

The people will either accept or reject these proposals and we will then know [83] finally where we stand as a nation. The amendment creates a basis for the legislative protection of human life in pregnancy. That is one of the ambiguities which existed in law in this State since the X case. The legislation will ensure the maximum degree of protection for the unborn child is provided. It will at the same time ensure a pregnant woman will receive any necessary medical treatment to protect her life. A key element of the approach adopted is that the electorate will be given the opportunity before the constitutional amendment is made to review the legislation which is necessary and which the courts have pointed out as being necessary. I say to Deputies who have asked about tying the hands of the House that this is not a sovereign Legislature. I do not understand how Members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann could exist under the delusion that it is. Bunreacht na hÉireann makes it abundantly clear to anyone who takes even a casual moment to peruse it that the only sovereign authority in the land is the people.

At the same time, I am pleased it is proposed.;3238381

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;F;Ms. Olivia Mitchell;Fine Gael;Yes. I was referring to the Deputy as the legislator. I wish the motivation for this referendum came from a source other than a handful of Independents and a few others. Nevertheless, I accept the Government's bona fides in that what we have before us is its honest and best effort to deal with an issue which has been unresolved for almost 20 years. What Deputy Roche said is correct. A great deal of work has gone into producing a package which, on the face of it, appears to give a little to both sides of the argument in the hope of achieving a consensus and, if not that, a sufficient majority to put this matter away for the foreseeable future. However, it is not the rights given in the proposal which are material to the outcome but those taken away. What is material for me is the proposal to reduce the right to life of women, to ask me to legislate for it and to invite women and their sons, fathers, boyfriends and brothers to vote to confirm a lesser right to life for women than they enjoy and have enjoyed under the Constitution for the past ten years and for which they voted.;3238385

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;F;Ms. Olivia Mitchell;Fine Gael;I am fundamentally opposed to such a proposal and I find it almost impossible to believe that in the 21st century we are being asked to consider it. This is a view which is shared by many. I hope that is clear enough for the Deputy. Nevertheless, I am conscious that there are many, among them my close friends, who hold a diametrically opposed view, that these views are validly and fervently held, and for these reasons I, too, would like this debated in as rational, non-confrontational, non-judgmental and sensitive a manner as possible. I am old enough to remember vividly the debates in the 1980s and 1990s with their excesses and do not want to live through them again. I am particularly conscious, as I was then, that there are between 100,000 and 200,000 women living in Ireland who made the lonely choice to have an abortion, many of them little more than children themselves. Many made the journey to England alone, in secret, confiding in no one and without the support of their families or friends. They have lived, often for many years, with that [86] secret because it is still a taboo subject, and now we are trying to make it a criminal one.;3238389

If we keep this to the forefront of our minds it will help us to be sensitive and rational. I do not seek to persuade others to my point of view on the substantive issue, not just because I know that I will not succeed but because I do not believe that I should try as it is a matter of personal belief. However, I question strongly the way in which it is proposed to deal with the issue, that is by way of legislation which is to become part of the Constitution. I do so, not on behalf of those who share my view, but on behalf of both sides of the divide since this process is as flawed for one side as the other. At the time of the first referendum, there were endless debates about the wording, as Deputy Roche stated, and we were assured by much the same people who now assure us at the third referendum that the wording would forever prevent abortion here. However, it was that wording which was interpreted to introduce legal abortion. Then we added one sentence to the Constitution and yet we got it wrong. We all misjudged it.;3238391

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;F;Ms. Olivia Mitchell;Fine Gael;The point is that it meant something different from what the majority of the public meant. If there is such potential in one sentence, then what is the potential to get it wrong in an entire Bill which will become an integral part of an immutable Constitution? It is a folly beyond words because every section, sentence and clause will be liable to challenge. Challenges will not be adjudicated on by the people nor those elected to legislate but by the Supreme Court. As sure as night follows day, some of these interpretations will not be what is envisaged now nor what was intended by the Oireachtas and the people. The legislature will be able to do nothing [87] short of frequently going back to the public to rectify the mistakes of the previous referendum. We make mistakes in legislation. Many Bills before the House are amendments to previous Bills and Bills are repealed, replaced, adjusted and expanded. We do it every day, either because we got it wrong in the first place, circumstances change or our thinking evolves. In this case, we will not be able to amend it as there will be no such room for manoeuvre. Transposing an entire Bill into the Constitution has never been done before, and with good reason. It is a dangerous precedent to vote away our rights and responsibilities to amend legislation. If we had good reason not to do so before, why do we dream of doing it for the first time in an area as fraught and complex as abortion where we got it wrong once, and many would claim twice? Deputy Noonan's questions flushed out many areas ripe for challenge in the courts and there are, I am sure, others which we cannot guess at. However, they are there in the ambiguities and interpretations to which almost every clause in the Bill is subject. In the light of the Taoiseach's responses, I will highlight some. The new Constitution would offer additional protection to the existing right of the unborn, but only after implantation. I understand the practical reason implantation was chosen as the measurable and knowable point when destruction becomes a criminal offence, but if the Taoiseach thinks that these different protections offered at different points of life will not be used as the basis for a challenge to the use of the IUD and morning after pill, he is wrong. He is offering a hostage to fortune. Deputy Noonan raised the question of a suicidal minor in a health board's care and her right to travel abroad under the new proposal in circumstances similar to the C case. The Taoiseach gave an ambiguous reply which referred to a woman, while the question was about a minor. Even if this was not a fudge, the Taoiseach cannot categorically state that a minor's right to travel outside the State is assured.;3238399

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;F;Ms. Olivia Mitchell;Fine Gael;The courts will decide. A case like this will be challenged and a court will not be able to respond as in the C case, because at that time abortion was legal. Now it will be criminal as well as unavailable. It will be a brave health board that tries to defend a situation where they would spend taxpayers' money on a service abroad which is a criminal offence in Ireland. No health board would even try. The impact of this proposal will be 'tough luck' to the next C case, [88] the mentally handicapped and the rape or incest child victim in the State's care. The kind of thinking behind these proposals is manifest in the Taoiseach's reply and the Minister's speech. It is instructive to read the Taoiseach's replies to Deputy Noonan's questions. I wish that the public would read them. Fine Gael sought more information because if this Bill becomes part of the Constitution we want clarity about what is being proposed and why, what impact it will have and on whom. The nub of this proposal is rolling back on the X case. Everything else in it can be achieved through legislation alone. Only this measure requires a constitutional referendum and, therefore, there must be no ambiguity about what it means. All of us here remember the X case and we know that it established a woman's right to an abortion where the continuation of her pregnancy represented a threat to the life of the mother, including suicide. In other words, it encompassed the threat to life from severe physical or mental illness. Since that case was hotly debated, a new generation of boys and girls has grown up who may not fully comprehend what we are about now. Before voting, every woman, her brother, father and boyfriend must know what is proposed, that is, that women will have a lesser right to life than they currently have and which, as a nation, we voted for ten years ago. This is a decision of monumental proportions. In effect it says that suicide is less serious, less grievous and more preferable than abortion. Is this the view of the people and, if not, why is it proposed to put it into the Constitution? Again, the Taoiseach's reply gives us some clue. He said: 'If legal provision were made for suicide risk, a system of psychiatric assessment and court supervision would almost inevitably follow'.;3238403

Yet an ordinary doctor looking after her physical health can recommend an abortion based on nothing more than 'reasonable opinion' formed in good faith. Apparently no number of specialist psychiatrists could make a similar assessment of the risk to life. I am perfectly sure psychiatrists can and do misdiagnose but I am equally certain that doctors do so every day. If we are to look for the real reason for the dropping of the suicide provision we must look further into the Taoiseach's remarks, and again this one is instructive – allowing for abortion 'where suicide is threatened by a pregnant woman would start an unstoppable slide towards social abortion'.;3238405

How can we trust them with anything? While I cannot find the reference, the same applies to new drugs coming on the market. There appears to be a fear that women might get their hands on them and they cause abortion. Instead of banning the drugs we are putting a ban into the Constitution. The name of the Bill is insulting, part of which reads: Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy. Who protects life more than women? Who has done it through the ages since the beginning of time? That type of language is insulting and my colleagues have referred to this insult. To suggest social abortion exists is to completely misunderstand not just women but human nature and, in fact, nature. Everything in a woman's psyche, her makeup, drives and motivates her to guard, protect, nourish and nurture her child inside and outside the womb until the day she dies.;3238412

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Preg;25.10.01;F;Ms. Olivia Mitchell;Fine Gael;It is an inescapable biological imperative. When a woman makes a choice to have an abortion it is because she considers it is the only choice. It is always and in every circumstance an act of desperation. I have heard women try to minimise the enormity of that decision but to them in their hearts it is an act of desperation. To remove the real threat of suicide as a condition for allowing abortion because of the fear of a possible slide towards social abortion is based on a totally false premise, because there simply is no such thing as a social abortion. Currently, an independent woman of means can, even in her desperation, go to London, albeit alone and secretly, but she has some comfort in knowing that she is seeking a service which is, at least, legal in her own country. It may not be available in her [90] own country but at least it is legal. This proposal, if passed, would not stop a single such woman from having an abortion. She will still go secretly and alone but with the added burden of having a taint of criminality and the public voted condemnation of her fellow countrymen and women. We have been accused both by ourselves and others of being hypocritical. Rather than face up to the problem we have been hypocritical in allowing our problems to be exported to Britain. What is happening now is much better than what is being proposed. I do not pretend it is the ideal circumstance but, at least, it offers legislators some room for manoeuvre when further hard cases arise, such as the X and C cases, whereas what is proposed does not leave any. The courts can interpret but the legislator cannot subsequently amend. What we have now is an extraordinary position whereby medical practice may change and so change the circumstances in which abortions are permitted, Ministers may increase or decrease the venues or locations where abortions can take place, any member of the public can challenge the provisions of the Constitution, including any changes resulting from medical or ministerial changes of practice over time, and judges can adjudicate on these. The only group left in the democracy who has no input whatsoever is the Parliament. Does this make any sense? This is a seriously flawed process. I ask Members and anybody listening to think long and hard before voting to tie our hands for ever because we will regret it and many women will live to regret it.;3238414

That is clear from the number of Deputies who are present and those listed to speak. That is not a criticism of those present but of those who decided they do not wish to participate. Many commentators have described the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill as a relatively conservative proposal. Perhaps they are right. I acknowledge that Deputy Mitchell had the courage to put her position on the record which is more than many have done. As she said, if the Constitution is amended, as outlined in the Bill, it will mean a rolling back of the position in the X case where the Supreme Court ruled that if it was established as a matter of probability that a real and substantial risk could be averted by the termination of a pregnancy, such a termination was lawful. The stated risk to the mother's life in this case arose because she had threatened to commit suicide if she had to continue with the pregnancy. As I understand it, this judgment means that abortion has been lawful in the State since 1992 in certain limited circumstances and if the constitutional amendment is passed that will no longer be possible. People should know that. Those listening to us should know what is being put to them. We are upfront in this Bill and in the announcements made that this will be the effect of the consti[91] tutional amendment. People should know what they are voting for.;3238415

The Government has stated that also. After the 1992 Supreme Court decision, three proposals were put to the people and they have been mentioned several times. The issues of travel and information were dealt with by amendments and the people decided in their wisdom that they wanted women to have the right to travel and the right to information. What was termed the 'substantive issue' was rejected by the voters and was ignored by successive Governments. Nine years later, this is the first attempt to address the substantive issue.

Deputy McManus made a passionate plea concerning a young woman who was raped, became suicidal and did not want to continue with her pregnancy. Again, Deputy Olivia Mitchell flagged the point in relation to this which is a cause of concern to me. I would like clarification on the C case, which involved a minor in the care of a health board which decided to seek consent for her to travel abroad for a termination. I fully understand the implications of the X case, but I am not sure about those of the C case. The young woman to whom Deputy McManus referred and those involved in the X and C cases have simply become statistics and are seen merely as being among the 6,000 plus women who travel to Britain for abortions each year. Deputy Dukes took the Government to task and stated that its response to this woman and all others who find themselves in such circumstances was to tell them to go to Britain. However, he and other members of his party have failed to indicate what is Fine Gael's response to the young woman in question. If we are to judge from the amendment to the Bill tabled by Fine Gael, that party is saying we should defer a decision for three months until the matter can be considered further in a legal sense. The view of the majority of the Fine Gael Members on the All-Party Committee on the [92] Constitution in relation to the X case was that we should do nothing.;3238421

Deputy McManus correctly pointed out that the floodgates did not open after 1992. There was a fear that, after the Supreme Court judgment, women would rush to the courts and demand their legal right to an abortion in this country. However, that did not happen and, to my knowledge, there has not been one case where a woman demanded that legal right.;3238435

That issue was not addressed in any of the consultations in which the all-party committee engaged or in the documents that have been produced. Even given the legal right of a woman to have an abortion in this country since 1992, why have women decided to travel to Britain? The answer has a great deal to do with the society in which we live and it has not been addressed. Most of the case studies of women in crisis pregnancy refer to the fear experienced by these women. Society has not changed dramatically since the 1920s and 1930s when women went away to have babies and returned home alone.;3238439

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;In the two minutes I had the previous day I referred to the fact that a lot of revisionism was taking place, that the 1983 debate and referendum had become clouded in myth and mythology and that we needed to remind ourselves of the circumstances that forced these Houses into such a divisive referendum and of the attempts made on this side of the House, particularly by the then leader of the Fine Gael Party, Dr. Garrett FitzGerald, the then Attorney General, Peter Sutherland, and the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, to urge the people to reject those dangerous words which, if inserted in the Constitution in 1983, could lead exactly to the opposite of what the pressure group then, SPUC, was looking for and which could, and did, put women at risk. Although, sadly, it took almost ten years for that to become a reality, we all lived with the shame and embarrassment of it. Because of that, another referendum was held in 1992. During that nine year period, through court case after court case taken by SPUC, women in Ireland were denied the right to information. Students and other groups were taken to court repeatedly. Copies of Cosmopolitan appeared month after month with a blank page showing the censorship which went on in this country in regard to the names and addresses of legal clinics and abortion centres in Britain. Women, in particular, lived with that. There was an even greater deprivation of the rights of women and citizens because during that period, the right of women to travel was questioned and denied. In the 1992 referendum, we dealt with the substantive issue, the right to travel and the right to information. This came about because of a horrific and tragic case, the X case, as a result of which the interpretation people feared in 1983 came to pass. A 14 year old girl who had been raped was pregnant and suicidal and her parents were denied the right to travel to a legal abortion clinic in Britain to have an abortion carried out. Despite our embarrassment and [1103] shame, the compassion of the people in identifying with the suffering and trauma that young girl and her parents were going through ensured we would get an outcome that would relieve such a terrible situation and that the State would pay the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court. We hit international headlines. I and, I am sure, Deputy Shatter and other colleagues in this House received telephone calls and queries from all over the world asking us if we were even members of the European Community as it was then known. As a result of that, we had a second debate and attempt to quickly and naturally restore the right to travel and information which, thankfully, was passed by a majority of voters. However, we also had and still have what is known as the 'substantive issue.' That was and is an attempt to remove the grounds under which in 1992 the Supreme Court allowed two parents and their young girl travel to Britain to have a legal abortion, as happened again in 1995 in another distressing case involving a young girl. This is because we could not and would not provide the necessary facilities here. The Supreme Court based its judgments on the threat of self-destruction or suicide. In 1992, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Flynn, in introducing the Second Stage debate on the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992, dealing with the right to travel and information, said that should it transpire that the people decided not to adopt the twelfth amendment, the Government had decided to introduce legislation to regulate the position obtaining as a result of the X decision. He continued by saying that if that amendment was defeated – and he did not believe that would happen which is a case of a political projection being wrong – it was the Government's firm and considered view that the only practicable alternative was to legislate on the basis of the X case. Mr. Flynn said that this was not meant to be a threat to anybody or to put pressure on them to vote in a particular way in the referendum. Not alone did Mr. Flynn promise that the only option if the amendment was defeated would be legislation on the basis of the X case, he used that assertion to urge people to vote for the removal of the threat of self-destruction. The people did not agree with that, they did not support it and they did not vote for it. Why, in 2001, are we facing a third attempt to put words into the Constitution that will clearly be challenged, and interpreted in ways that will not satisfy the same pressure group who pushed for it in 1983, 1992 and now in 2001? Members may be aware of the famous 'Rocky Horror Show' which has the theme song titled, 'Let's do the time warp again'. That is exactly what we are doing. We are doing the time warp again. In 1983, a small, intolerant pressure group decided that it did not trust legislators. In 1992, because of the Supreme Court interpretation, the group decided that it did not trust the courts or [1104] the judges. Now in 2001, it does not trust the psychologists or the psychiatrists. However, every year and every decade, they do not trust women. During these debates women have been disembodied, divided and dehumanised. It gives me and other colleagues in this Chamber no satisfaction to go through this again because underlying the issue is the belief of some men that women have to be controlled with regard to a murderous intent towards their unborn. That is basic, fundamental, fundamentalist and highly insulting. During the ten years since the last debate, thousands of women have travelled to Britain for abortions. This required desperation, silence, shame and the extraordinary, practical need to raise enough money to pay for the journey and the treatment. It was usually done in a solitary, shamed way. As Deputy McManus has said, special medicines and antibiotics are given to Irish women because, from the medical experience of people working in the British clinics, it is realised that the majority of those women will not seek treatment, either psychological or medical, when they come home. There is also a more dangerous experience. Because of the difficulties and because of the lack of economic independence on the part of many of these women, the termination of pregnancy is delayed, giving rise to huge problems, including medical, emotional and psychological problems. We in Ireland are not prepared to take that on board much less address it. Added to the present debate is another facile slogan. The slogan in 1983 was 'abortion on demand – a woman's right to choose.' The underlying meaning of that was if a woman had any right or opportunity to choose, she would choose to abort her child. I want people to take on the meaning of that in the experience of women, not just in Ireland, but worldwide in the experience of refugees and millions of women desperately trying to nourish and keep their children and their lives together. We now have the slogan 'social abortion.' I will not spend time on this subject because many of my colleagues – including, I am glad to say, male colleagues – have been appalled and outraged that we should reduce such a fundamentally difficult and desperate situation to a phrase such as 'social abortion.' However, the phrase gives an indication of the mind set of those who view women at that level. With regard to all areas of equality, citizenship, and rights that touch on the status of women, we have much to worry about. The phrase 'social abortion' is an indication of the deep, traditional, subversive, suspicious situation women must still deal with in Ireland. I pay tribute to the many male colleagues in this and in past debates who have also felt offended and rejected by the language and attitude to women. In 2001, more than ever, this feeling is shared by the majority of voters, both men and women. If this ludicrous legislation is put forward in a referendum to the [1105] people, they will reject it, and they deserve the right to do so if this matter goes that far. In 1992, when the details of the X case were revealed in Ireland and worldwide, there was a unanimous reaction. People were horrified at how it could have happened. A child was not allowed to have a legal abortion in Britain. There was shock, shame, embarrassment and above all, compassion, which I stress. We have compassion. We are family-centred. We care about mothers and children. Why are we separating them in this divisive way now when on other levels they are almost an icon in our society? The Irish mammy could be canonised any day. Why is there a split mindset with regard to women as mothers? At least, let us hope this debate will engender discussion, philosophical and otherwise, about this difficult and divisive situation in which women find themselves. It is the old story of Eve and the Virgin Mary, but that debate is for another day and I do not know if we would be allowed to have it in this Chamber. When Deputy Noonan, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, addressed a series of questions to the Taoiseach, he was accused of time wasting as if it was a political ploy. However, the questions were very important and we learned much from the replies which revealed not just flaws in the proposed legislation but the most flawed thinking we have ever encountered in this House. I have a great regard for this Chamber and I consider it a privilege to be here. One of the greatest pleasures – soon to come to an end – I have had is to be a legislator. It is a privilege that is not enjoyed by many and it is one we should not lightly relinquish. We receive a mandate from the people to legislate on their behalf and they trust us to do so, but that is about to be taken away. It worries me not just with regard to this debate but with regard to the future power, authority and autonomy of legislators. It is being suggested that this flawed legislation will be put to the electorate, but how can voters know what the impact or import of the individual sections will be? If they vote in favour of the referendum, that legislation will stand as part of the Constitution and, thus, we as legislators will be powerless to change it. There is not any legislation in which I have been involved in debating that did not require amendments. In some cases, once legislation has been enacted, we only realise after it has been implemented that it requires amendment because we overlooked certain dimensions. This legislation is unprecedented, unbelievable and bizarre. We are tying ourselves into a referendum on legislation which is flawed. As legislators we often realise that legislation is flawed after it has been enacted, yet in this case we will not be able to do anything to rectify it. As a Deputy serving my last term in the House, I am worried by the enormity of that situation. I will not refer to the four Independent Deputies who have brought this upon us because I do not think they would understand the import of it. However, [1106] I am asking both Government parties and, in particular, the Minister for Health and Children, to think again. Do not plunge us into what we went through in 1983, 1992 and 1995. It is too much and does not reflect well on any of us.;3242393

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Séamus Kirk;Fianna Fáil;I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. This is the first opportunity for a legislative response to this most difficult and emotive of issues since the X case in 1992. Most Members agree the legislative position has been unsatisfactory since 1992 and getting to the stage where the House could debate legislation on the matter has been a long and tortuous path. The issue has been extensively discussed and considered by the all-party committee on the Constitution. The committee took the advised road of inviting detailed submissions from interested parties. I was a member of the committee and there was an intense interest in the subject. The number of submissions meant that the committee secretariat was very busy for a long period during the hearings. The decision to provide concerned members of the public and the legal and medical professions with an opportunity to make individual submissions to the committee was very good. It took a long time to get through all of them but at the end of the day the subject was so serious that it would have been very wrong for a committee of the House to short circuit the debate and not provide people with their first opportunity to make their case to Oireachtas Members. As one who espouses the view that we should have a civilised society where there is clear and adequate protection for the unborn, I am pleased the Government has decided to introduce the legislation and, ultimately, to afford the electorate the opportunity to adjudicate on the subject. There were emotive debates on abortion in 1983 and 1992 and this is probably the final opportunity for the necessary constitutional amendment to be agreed by the electorate. The electorate wants the opportunity to air its collective voice. The Government made a wise decision to produce legislation and, by so doing, give the people the benefit of the debate in the House before the referendum is put to them. I hope this decision will be vindicated. This legislation seeks to protect best medical practice in this area. It also seeks to provide for a prohibition on abortion and to underpin that position by way of a constitutional amendment. In any man's language, this is a laudable objective on the part of the Minister. Those who predict that the referendum will be rejected by the electorate will have to wait and see. There is a diversity of views among Members on this issue and one can appreciate the depth of emotion which reflects the position outside this House. However, in the final analysis we are talking about the protection of those in the most vulnerable and least advantaged position to protect their own lives, namely, the unborn. We are balancing this objective with ensuring that the best medical practice and treatment can be provided for pregnant women. The underlying and core objective of this legislation is to get that balance right. I am not sure if he interpreted it as a danger, [1135] but Deputy Joe Higgins referred to the issue of social abortion. Few, if any, Members would wish a situation to develop in which abortion was freely available and where the phrase 'social abortion' became common currency in the political arena. That would be undesirable and would quickly lead to a breakdown and lowering of standards in what is a reasonably civilised society. Having studied the hearings held by the constitutional committee and listened to the debate in the House, I am satisfied the Government has taken the right decision by bringing forward this legislation and underpinning it by way of a constitutional amendment to be endorsed by the people. It strikes a balance on this issue, while ensuring that this remains a civilised society and a beacon for other communities across Europe. If we are to give a lead in this direction we should not have to apologise to anyone for the stance we take. I support this legislation and hope it is passed. I also hope the referendum will be endorsed by the people.;3242397

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Noel O'Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I am aware that this issue cost Frank Crowley his seat in the Cork North-West constituency in the last election, as disgusted Fine Gael voters in that constituency switched in droves to Fianna Fáil candidates. They were disappointed by Fine Gael concessions to the liberal agenda of the Labour Party. Some smaller parties and Independent Deputies have questions to answer on abortion. I am grateful for the support of four Independent colleagues, Deputies Fox, Blaney, Gildea and Healy-Rae on this matter, but people would be foolish to conclude that all Independents are pro-life. Some campaigners speak of a woman's right to choose, but to choose what? If they mean a woman's right to choose abortion, why do they not say so openly? Most Irish people do not believe that a person has the right to take the life of another, but they believe that a woman has the right to choose whether to become pregnant. Our society supports that right to choose, provided it is exercised with regard to conception. There are differences of opinion regarding whether it is morally right to use artificial contraception and about the morality of forms of contraception which operate after conception, which are known as abortifacients. I will say more about this issue later. Those who oppose artificial contraception accept that a woman has the right to choose whether to become pregnant. There are differences of opinion regarding the freedom of choice that should be allowed when a woman's right to choose not to become pregnant has been violated. Severe sanctions are imposed on those who commit such violations. In the last decade, the concept of rape within marriage has been introduced by this House, precisely to support women's right to choose. As a crime, rape is considered as second in seriousness only to murder. There can be no question, therefore, about our support of the right to choose whether to become pregnant. Most people, however, will not support the right to a change of mind, at the cost of a human life, after pregnancy has occurred. There can be no moral justification for such a decision. Some campaigners talk of the terrible situation [1128] when a woman has been raped and becomes pregnant against her will. As I have said, our society sees this as the most serious crime that can be committed against a human being, with the exception of murder. It stands to reason, therefore, that we cannot condone the murder of an innocent unborn child, even in such terrible circumstances. Most people oppose abortion in the case of a pregnancy as a result of rape. We show support for women's rights by helping to pursue rapists, but we cannot do so by killing innocent children. What about suicide? Suicide may be a complex issue with many different causes. What was so wrong about the X case judgment was that it took the safety of an unborn human life out of the domain of medical judgments on medical threats to the mother's life and that of her child and into the domain of psychiatric assessment and even psychology in some cases. It was based, ultimately, on what a woman in a distressed state of mind was prepared to threaten to get her own way on abortion. It is quite clear that the pro-abortion people would make it known that certain psychiatrists who would be considered as pro-abortion could be relied upon to certify that a woman had suicidal tendencies to allow her the constitutional right to an abortion to be carried out in Ireland. She would, of course, be certified as having recovered from the suicidal tendencies once the abortion was performed. One might call it the pro-abortion Irish solution to an Irish problem. The purpose of the twenty-fifth amendment is to put a stop to that route to abortion. There is no secret about this. The X case effectively permitted social abortion, which those of us who support this amendment are trying to stop. It is as simple as that. The opponents to the holding of this referendum oppose it for one reason only. They are convinced that it will be passed by the people. To deny the people a referendum on a proposal in the knowledge that they would approve that proposal would be a fundamental denial of democracy, yet there are people in this House who oppose the concept of holding a referendum on this proposal. If they oppose it, let them campaign on that basis to get people to vote against it. However, there are serious questions about the commitment to democracy of anybody in this House who opposes the idea of putting this matter to the people for decision in a referendum. Those on the pro-life side have raised questions about abortifacients and stem cell research. The issue of stem cell research and cloning, as well as conception by artificial means outside the womb, raises other issues of a pro-life nature. Catholic teaching in relation to these questions is followed by most people in this country and that teaching simply states that these techniques are morally wrong as interference in the natural process of conception. There is a significant minority within the Catholic Church who would disagree to varying extents with this teaching. The situation is probably similar with the stance adopted by other [1129] Christian churches and other faiths – there are those who disagree to a varying extent. There is no legislative one-stop-shop or one size fits all proposal to safeguard human life after conception. Issues will continue to arise which will require debate and considered action. Although I am a Catholic and have no inhibitions about advocating Christian values in society, I would be disappointed if Christians of various denominations were the only people to support this ban on abortion. This a human rights issue for everybody, for people of every faith and none, for people of many religions, just as it a religious moral issue for me as a Catholic. However, people of no religion also have moral values. I would strongly encourage people who do not profess a religious belief, but who agree with the arguments against social abortion to join with Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox and other Christians, Muslims, Jews and other faiths in taking a pro-life stand at the referendum by voting 'Yes.' This is not a Catholic sectarian issue. If anybody has any doubts about this, they should ask Unionist politicians in the North what their policy on abortion is. On that point I hope we will not have to suffer listening to the nonsense about having a sectarian constitution in the Republic. Anyone who trots out that nonsense in support of a 'No' vote does not deserve a hearing. The right tone for me to set in this debate is to say that I respect the honestly held views of those who argue that abortion is acceptable, but I strongly disagree with them. I believe I speak for a large majority of the people of Ireland, North and South, in saying that. I will vote in favour of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. I will actively campaign for a 'Yes' vote in the subsequent referendum. I am clear that this measure only bans abortion and does not tackle some other pro-life concerns. It is intended only to solve the abortion problem. I am disappointed that Deputy Bradford has had to leave. I obviously touched a nerve when I mentioned pro-life and pro-abortion Members of the Oireachtas in the Fine Gael Party. I thought I heard mutterings from some of them already today during the debate. I am sure we will hear more from pro-lifers, especially from the southern part of the country, who probably share my views. I apologise if I have upset him in any way, but one is entitled to express one's view.;3242402

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Conor Lenihan;Fianna Fáil;I pay tribute to Deputy Barnes for her fine contribution. I do not agree entirely with everything she said but it is fair to say she has been a champion of women's rights here, going back to her early days in the House. She has kept faith with the vocation she set for herself of speaking clearly to advocate the rights of women in all circumstances. It is a great pity that she is not seeking re-election, not least for Fine Gael which will have difficulty in retaining that seat in Dún Laoghaire. So much for Fine Gael's worries, however. Deputy Barnes has made a balanced speech. I find it rather strange to be speaking in this debate because if one had asked me in the 1980s, I would not have thought I would be involved in politics now. Part of the reason I was not involved in politics in the 1980s, and part of the reason I emigrated to England, was precisely because of all those referendums that were going on. It seemed to me there was much opportunism and conservatism in evidence at the time. When it came to abortion and divorce, so-called official Ireland tended to ignore people in difficult situations with reduced economic and social circumstances. One of the characteristics of the 1980s was that official and unofficial Ireland co-existed and people lived quite different lifestyles. Official Ireland seemed determined to ignore what was happening in unofficial Ireland, and moved in the opposite direction. Now, however, unofficial Ireland has ceased to be. As a society, we have moved far beyond the 1980s, socially and most importantly economically. While it may sound callous to say so, we have moved on and our society is much more secure in its value systems and its sense of well-being. Irish society is much more self-confident now. In that context, we must grapple with this age-old problem of where we stand on abortion. The situation must be clarified once and for all. Nobody on this side of the House is holding a torch for these measures. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, have accepted that this legislation represents a compromise. It is not something we would choose to implement in an ideal world. It reflects the compromise and consensus that developed as a result of widespread consultation through an Oireachtas committee, as well as much contemplation by the Taoiseach and by the House as a whole. The Taoiseach has played an honourable role on this issue. He made a promise prior to the last election that there would be a referendum on this issue before he left office. He has not honoured that type of promise in every case. For instance, he was criticised for not honouring his promise [1107] concerning the Partnership for Peace, although I believe he was right not to do so. Abortion is a fundamental issue, however, which has perplexed the political establishment for years and it is time an element of clarity was brought to bear on the situation. The Government's proposal by way of a constitutional amendment to insert legislation in the Constitution is a positive thing to do. Deputy Barnes spoke earlier of a lack of trust in the political classes that obtained in the 1980s. I am sad to have to disappoint her but the level of trust has not increased since then, mainly because of what some of the more prominent members of the political classes did in the 1980s. Given the large scale public cynicism about what occurs in the House, perhaps it is a good thing that this legislation is to be incorporated in the Constitution. There will, therefore, be no change to it in future without the people being directly consulted. Abortion is a difficult moral issue and in some sense we are at a turning point as a society. There is a strong pro-choice element within the population. A recent Ireland on Sunday opinion poll indicated that 40% of those surveyed were pro-choice, while 60% were pro-life. Broadly speaking, that reflects the state of public opinion at the moment. As we know, however, from previous referenda on divorce and abortion, and from the referendum on the Nice treaty, that margin can narrow substantially in the run up to a campaign. This is a difficult issue and one about which all politicians should be careful. Politicians should not preach about such moral issues because people are sick of that. Essentially, it is a matter of huge personal conscience as to how people vote on this matter. Yesterday, members of my party met representatives of the pro-life movement who were pushing the case for a 'yes' vote. At that meeting I specifically made the point that in this case politicians should not canvass vigorously and aggressively, as they do in general elections and by-elections. It is the duty of every politician in the House, once legislation is passed and a referendum date chosen, to go about his or her business in a responsible way. We should seek to inform rather than proselytise on the issue. If politicians do this, they will win respect from the public which is cynical about referendums as we know from the Nice referendum fiasco. Few people actually vote in referendums. I suspect, however, the turnout will be higher on this occasion. The turnout will reflect on this House. A low turnout will not reflect disinterest in the issue, but the weakness of the political class and its inability to communicate with the public on which it depends for support—;3242403
1899;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Bernard Durkan;Fine Gael;Unfortunately, we are still making them. The sooner we come to grips with this the better for politics and our society. The debate evolved and at the time we were told that the amendment brought forward was the amendment of all amendments, that it was the one that would set aside everything, resolve all problems and eliminate the possibility of abortion at any stage in the future. It was a change from the original wording. It was agreed by the main parties in the House and eventually put to the people and carried. We all know what happened. The sad part is that it was not the amendment to end all amendments because it was breached in the first difficult case that arose. There were legal and medical experts on both sides who were able to argue everybody who spoke on this matter out of existence and said that debate would be the end of the argument. There are those – more power to them if they are correct – who will say today that this will be the end of the debate, but unfortunately it will not. For some reason this debate goes on and on. In the past couple of days I, like other Members of the House, received correspondence inquiring about the definition of when life begins. It is starting the debate all over again about whether implantation or conception is the correct interpretation of the beginning of life. I am not a theologian and I do not know if I am qualified to come to a decision in such a debate. I do not know that the lawyers are qualified either. I doubt that the Supreme Court is in a position to make an absolute definition, but only a judgment on the debate. I am a male member of society. A woman probably looks differently at that issue. She would look at it against the backdrop of perhaps having to make a decision. Again, I am not saying whether she should go one way or the other. That would depend on the compelling factors at the time. However, it could be difficult for a woman in a situation like that. I have dealt with cases, as have other Members, and will no doubt deal with cases in the future, where advice had to be given to people in difficult circumstances. One does one's best. I have not advised anybody to have an abortion or not to have an abortion. It is a matter for the individual. Obviously it has to be the woman who makes that decision as she is the person most directly involved. That then brings into focus the question of the unborn and at what stage life begins. We are thus back to the argument of whether it begins at implantation or conception. Where do we go from there? I do not envisage an end to that argument. I listened carefully to this debate in the past. I distinctly remember when the so-called X case arose. The proposal before the House is to incorporate legislation in the Constitution and to interlink the two in such a way that they cannot be separated without another referendum. What happens in the case of a woman or girl who is a ward of court? I am aware of the argument that has taken place as to how this might be resolved [1157] but I do not anticipate an easy resolution if there is a division at the time such a case arises. The argument cannot be postponed for a couple of years so that it can be worked out. The decision has to be made and cannot be postponed. It may well be that whatever side one comes down on, one may be wrong. The critical issue is that in the event of such a scenario developing, what happens then? Where do we go for advice? Do we go to the lawyers, doctors or theologians? Can we expect that the advice available will be ultimately correct? I do not believe it can be. I hate to be judgmental, particularly in regard to situations in which I do not have to make a decision. It is not a personal decision so it is easy to give advice to others. It is easy to tell somebody what is the morally upright thing to do. I have to admit that I do not know how I would react if I were in that situation. For that reason, I hope I would be humble enough to admit to being a mere mortal and to try to get away from the usual judgmental advice that is handed to us, as it were, from some higher authority that we dare not question in relation to a subject about which we know little. After this debate, I hope there will be peace in the land in relation to this subject. I am not in favour of abortion but it is easy for me to say that since I am not likely to have to make a personal decision in relation to it. That is one side of the argument. The other side of the argument is the right to life, which I accept and endorse. I do not accept that anybody has a higher moral ground or stance. Each Member of the House is equal in their knowledge of the situation and of the circumstances likely to arise in the future. I do not believe, therefore, that we should be deferring to opinion, whether it be eminent legal opinion, the Supreme Court or medical opinion. We all have the right to make up our minds and to state our views. That is the best way to be fair. In 1983 we were told the referendum was the end of the debate. I am reliably informed by those who know such things that this proposal is also the end of the debate. I do not think so. In the event of a hard case arising – there are many variations of what would constitute a difficult case – what happens then? Who takes the decision? Do we have a referendum? Do we go to the Supreme Court? The Irish solution to the Irish problem is fine but I hope that whatever happens hereafter will be humane, compassionate and caring. Those are elements in the debate that were lacking in the past. I hope they are present in the current debate. What happens in the future when we might have to deal with the situation as it arises again? A couple of things can happen. We can do nothing. We can throw up our hands and say we do not want to discuss the issue further. If somebody is caught on one or other side of the argument, we can say 'tough luck' and walk away. That would not be a compassionate or caring thing to do. I have no doubt that circumstances will arise at some stage in the future which will [1158] be so compelling as to make it virtually impossible for people to claim it does not concern them but is a matter for the law courts, the medical profession or for another referendum. I am not sure we can go down that road. Unfortunately, I fear it will come to that. One of the issues that arose in the landmark X case was the risk of suicide and the threat to the life of the mother creating a situation where the life of the unborn could be terminated. It is not an easy decision. Who is in a position to come to that judgment now? What has happened in the meantime to prove beyond doubt to the various professions involved that in such a situation the methodology of the proposed legislation is sufficient to address the issues raised? Nothing has happened. I hope I am proven wrong. In the event of that situation emerging again, what do we do? What will we do if a tragedy occurs? Will we have another referendum? Will we seek legal advice once again? What will we do? Fine Gael has been castigated by Government Deputies. It is unusual for them to do so and I know it pains them greatly to embark on such a tirade. The leader of my party requested replies to a series of questions which were carefully considered and well phrased. The questions were mindful of the history of this issue. Some of the replies were vague and unsatisfactory, to say the least, so further information is required. I do not feel embarrassed that Fine Gael has not decided one way or the other just yet. By considering the issue, we are doing the right thing. There will be no time for reflection after the referendum. Therefore, before the referendum, there should be a full clarification of the matters raised by Deputy Noonan in relation to abortion. Deputy Kenneally claimed that the Independent Deputies who support the Government had nothing to do with the timing of this referendum, but that is not what they say as they claim to have been instrumental. The political question that automatically arises is whether the Independents are wrong. Have they told a fib? Are they spinning a yarn? I would be careful if I was a Government Deputy as I would not be able to rely on my Coalition partners. I would quiz them carefully to be absolutely sure of what is being said. Although we are approaching a general election, the landing may go wrong. Instead of suggesting that the Independents had nothing to do with the timing of this Bill, perhaps Deputy Kenneally could have admitted that it was brought forward and the Government is responding to the views of the Independents. I started by pointing out that I am a mere male Member of this House. I have the right to comment during this debate, but I do not claim to have the same knowledge or clarity on this matter as female Deputies. It is a normal and natural state of affairs. It is unlikely that I will have to make a personal decision in relation to this matter but I respect the views of those who have had to make such a decision. Compassion and understanding of the events that led to the problem [1159] should be demonstrated. Our society should support those who have made decisions and who may later have felt that the decision was right or wrong. Hindsight always brings clear vision, but we should be caring and compassionate to those who have to make difficult decisions. If we do not display such values, we have lost our way. It is to be hoped that this matter will not have to be revisited again. It seems extraordinary that a Bill and a constitutional amendment are to be linked. I assure the House that this will happen again, when people learn about the possibility. People on housing lists may call for their needs to be incorporated in the Constitution. Similar provisions may be made in areas like education and health, for example, for those looking for orthodontic treatment or for those on waiting lists. Why is it not written into the Constitution that such people may have recourse to the Constitution to have their needs addressed? It is a thorny operation and I hope the right decision will be made. This should be the last time we have to address the issue of abortion in my lifetime, but I am afraid that will not be the case.;3242404
1900;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;F;Ms. Deirdre Clune;Fine Gael;I was not involved in a public fashion in the debate that took place in the House [1146] previously, but as an ordinary voter I followed the debate with interest. I was aware of the highly charged situations that arose in the House and in debates around the country and I am aware through family members of the difficult experiences many public representatives faced in 1983 and 1992. The same tension, bitterness and disrespect do not pervade the debate today although I am not sure the Tánaiste will receive the consensus she seeks. We will have the debate, that has been missing so far, only when this proposal is teased out in the public domain and when people get a chance to go over the detail. Like others, I have not received a large volume of correspondence on this issue but in the past week all the correspondence I received on the matter opposes the legislation. Many positive things can be said for the Government proposals. The most welcome is the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. Fine Gael published a Private Members Bill over the summer, the Care of Persons Board Bill which demonstrated our desire to address the lack of support for women with crisis pregancies. Support is essential, as acknowledged by many speakers today. An issue that is of great concern is that we are now attempting to reverse the X case judgment and to state that in legislation. In 1992 the Supreme Court determined in the X case that a threat to self-destruction can amount to a substantial risk to the life of the mother. Today we have a proposal which specifically excludes self-destruction. In the Government's wording this legislation excludes from the definition of abortion any medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which, or as a result of which, unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction. Why is this? Why do we decide that suicide and the threat of suicide are not real illness and therefore do not entitle a woman to an abortion? I have been told by various professionals that suicidal tendencies cannot be measured and that their existence is based on opinion only. Where does the psychiatric profession stand on this question? I know of no study of suicidal pregnant women. I understand that pregnancy is a protective state of being and that most pregnant women develop nurturing and protective tendencies towards their unborn child. I am sure this is true for most pregnancies but what studies have been carried out on crisis pregnancies? What were the feelings of the unfortunate 14 year old girl at the centre of the X case and what attitude did she have towards her pregnancy? None of us will ever know. The debate at the time centred around her right to travel. How many studies have been carried out on suicidal women in crisis pregnancies? I do not believe such a study exists. We have heard much discussion on the non-risk of suicide among pregnant women. However, not all preg[1147] nancies are normal. Many pregnancies exist in a situation of crisis rather than of happiness and support. Age, poverty, family commitments and the fear of social stigma can all create a crisis for a pregnant woman. A crisis pregnancy is completely different from a normal pregnancy. The Master of the Rotunda Hospital, Dr. Peter McKenna, wrote in a recent article in The Irish Times: I have reservations concerning the fact that the risk of suicide has been removed specifically as a justification for termination. I personally have never seen a patient where a termination is necessary for psychiatric reasons but I have a niggling fear that some day I might. [He goes on to say] I am still unhappy that a specific cohort of patients are being excluded for no better reason than their inclusion could be open to interpretation. This expresses my own concern. I am aware of the report given by Dr. Anthony Clare to the all-party Oireachtas committee in which he appears to exclude a pregnant woman having suicidal tendencies. Doctors differ and opinions vary but we are being asked to make a judgment on something with which we are not medically equipped to deal. I am neither a medical nor a psychiatric expert. I could get several different opinions from a number of medical professionals. Which of us could stand with our hands on our hearts and say that no pregnant woman should ever be allowed an abortion if she is suicidal? Which of us can say that such a situation will never arise? The fact that we are attempting to attach such a provision to the Constitution is alarming. I fail to understand why mental health does not have the same standing as physical health in this area. Have we made any advances in our sympathy for mental illness or our understanding or recognition of it? What will this referendum and legislation mean for the recent advances in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression or post-natal depression? Society now regards these conditions as illnesses and treats them accordingly. Are these advances to be downgraded? It is being argued that a person, male or female, who says he or she is suicidal cannot be trusted. How do psychiatrists stand on this question? Are they to be trusted? It is implied that a pregnant woman could easily claim to be suicidal and thereby demand an abortion in this jurisdiction. If that were the case we would have seen such claims made since the Supreme Court judgment of 1992. Following that judgment any woman is entitled to an abortion in this country if she is suicidal. The Minister said that the inclusion of suicide 'would not command wide support and could, in effect, ultimately open the way to social abortion'. If this were the case the Minister's fears would have already become a reality since 1992 but the floodgates have not been opened. The Supreme Court judgment has [1148] not led to abortion on social grounds. However, the number of Irish women travelling to the UK for abortions since 1992 has increased to more than 6,000, and this is merely the number of women who give Irish addresses. The essence of the current proposal is exactly the same as that put to the people and rejected in 1992. I do not believe the views of the electorate have changed since then. They made their judgment on three proposals in 1992 and I believe they will do so again, when and if they vote on the referendum. We are going back over the same ground. The same positions were articulated in this House at that time, although I believe some Members have changed their opinions since then. The proposal has been described as anti-women. It says to a section of the community that we do not accept their bona fides in a particular situation. It is dangerous to ask the people to make a judgment on the mental health of a pregnant woman. The women of Ireland will reject this amendment and many men will support them in their views. I agree with Deputy Michael Ahern when he says this is not an issue for women only. Many women who travel to the UK for abortions do so with the support of their male partners, many of whom travel with them. Many men play a part in supporting women when they are pregnant and in the period following pregnancy or abortion. The issue affects men and women, although women deal with the physical reality of pregnancy. The Supreme Court judgments following the X case and the C case both stated that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and a substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother and that this real and substantial risk could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination would be lawful. Having been through the process in 1992 I fail to understand the value of putting the issue to the people again. From what I have seen and heard I have no doubt the proposal will be rejected. Much of the debate so far has centred on arguments for and against the constitutional amendment. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency also deserves to be discussed in detail because it can make an enormous difference. The recommendation of the committee on the Constitution to establish such an agency followed a proposal from Fine Gael. It is in this area that we will do most to reduce the level of abortion. While the legislation will do nothing for the 6,000 women who travel abroad each year, the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is a very valuable initiative. I hope we will be able to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies through education and raising awareness, particularly of contraception. I welcome the Minister's statement today and in a number of earlier press releases that the agency will address the needs and concerns of women who have already had abortions and provide them with the kind of support that has been lacking to date. As the debate progresses, we should [1149] not forget that choosing to travel to the United Kingdom for an abortion is a very lonely journey for any woman. These women have few supports in this country. The committee report outlined the reasons women cited for proceeding with an abortion. Job related concerns were cited by 36 women, the stigma of lone parenthood by 30 and the needs of the child by 30. A further 28 cited financial concerns, 27 were not ready to have a child, 34 could not cope, 32 stated they were too young and 19 already had a child. Others mentioned education and training while some said they never wanted a child. Social stigma, however, is cited again and again. The recent report on lone parents produced by the National Economic and Social Forum outlined the problems many single parents face. They include poverty and barriers to employment such as child care, housing problems such as finding accommodation, and rent problems such as dependency on local authorities for rent and supplementary welfare allowance. These issues need to be addressed. I welcome the fact that the new agency will underpin and support the work being carried out by these agencies which already provide a valuable resource for women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies, particularly young women. To reduce unwanted pregnancies, particularly among young people, there must be a greater emphasis on education, notably sex education and the use of contraception, in particular. We have heard a great deal about sex education programmes prepared for children. However, some schools, including some I know, have not adopted these very valuable programmes. Many parents depend on the education system to provide their children with practical information and education on sexual matters. While there will always be some who do this at home, we cannot depend on parents. It is important that sex education is available in schools also. Many unhelpful labels, both pro-life and pro-abortion, have been bandied around in this debate. The majority of Irish people do not want abortion made available and I do not know of anyone who wants abortion made as readily available as in the United Kingdom. However, people do want to ensure the life of the mother is protected in all circumstances and that medical opinion is respected. I hope the debate will advance with respect shown to both sides. Although I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I would like to contribute on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to hold Committee Stage in the House in order that we can tease out the matters of concern to my party.;3242405
1901;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Joe Higgins;Socialist Party;(Dublin West): I am opposed to the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. It has one purpose only, to overturn the 1992 ruling of the Supreme Court in the X case in which it stated that termination of pregnancy was allowed by the Irish Constitution when there was a substantial risk that continuation of a pregnancy could pose a serious threat to the life of the woman through self-destruction. The only change this Bill makes is to make [1130] illegal such a termination in such circumstances and therefore its effect is that the death by suicide of a woman is acceptable to the Government and preferable to the ending of the pregnancy which caused the state of mind that would trigger suicide. The Bill cannot, therefore, claim to protect human life in pregnancy because, stated at its most extreme, it elevates a fertilised embryo of some days old and virtually invisible to a pre-eminent position over the life of an adult woman. Even in the terms of the Government's own reasoning there is much absurdity in this because, according to it, it is fine to attempt to expel from the body of a woman before implantation a fertilised embryo that may have been some days in existence, but as soon as implantation has occurred, with virtually no difference in the state of the embryo, it becomes a serious crime to be prohibited, if the Government has its way, by the Constitution. The only change the Bill introduces is to make illegal a woman's choice to have an abortion in the case of a threat or danger of suicide. It does not deal with the trauma of the thousands of women who end crisis pregnancies each year by travelling to Britain. It recognises existing practices, including the use of the intra-uterine device and postcoital applications. It, therefore, has nothing to do with the interests of women or morality. Its purpose is naked political opportunism. The Government believes it can copperfasten a small percentage of the conservative vote in the forthcoming general election and in that way make a bid to improve its chances of holding on to power after the next general election. It is quite incredible that the Progressive Democrats Party, which styles itself as a party of democrats and liberals, fully supports this proposal which has undoubtedly come primarily from Fianna Fáil. They do not, on this issue, deserve their title of Progressive Democrats, if they ever had a right to it. Pathetic Democrats would be more appropriate. There is naked hypocrisy in the Government's approach to the trauma suffered by thousands of women. The Taoiseach in presenting the Bill said: In the last few days we have had further confirmation of the 6,500 occasions in the last year alone when women, giving an Irish address, have had abortions in Britain – about 18 women every single day of the year. Each of these stories is a cause of sadness in itself. Each of these stories demands a fair, compassionate and honest response from all of us. What is the fair, compassionate and honest response from the Taoiseach and the Government? It is to criminalise every woman who opts to terminate a pregnancy should she attempt to do so in the State rather than travelling to Britain. It is hardly honest and compassionate to threaten a woman with 12 years in jail at the most distressing time in her life. A woman, for example, in desperate circumstances, who tries to self-administer an abortion to end a crisis pregnancy and [1131] who ends up in a hospital in the State because things go horribly wrong will be at the centre of a criminal investigation as a result of what the Government is proposing in the Bill. It raises a big question about the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which I will speak about later, which is supposed to give aid, comfort, counselling and support to women who seek support and who have terminated a pregnancy. If that termination is carried out in the State in violation of the criminalisation policy of the Government, is the agency to which that woman turns obliged to notify the Director of Public Prosecutions that a crime has been carried out in the State, which would merit 12 years in prison, and is the DPP obliged to investigate and bring charges? That question should be answered by the Minister in his reply. The Taoiseach claims the Government is providing an honest response and then he proceeds to enshrine blatant dishonesty in legislation. Section 1 decrees that an abortion is not an abortion because the Government does not wish it to be characterised as an abortion. Section 1 states that abortion 'does not include the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction'. What does that mean? Abortion takes place in Ireland in registered hospitals by eminent obstetricians when that need arises. In November 2000 at the public hearings of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution the master of the Rotunda Hospital made clear the position in that regard. He was frank and honest because he must deal with the real situation and not the fiction which politicians on the Government side create to try to gain political advantage and solve political problems. As regards terminations carried out to save the life of a woman in maternity hospitals, he said: Personally, I think that you are better to be up front and clean about this and say that the pregnancy is being aborted. That is the treatment. It's not that it is a side effect of the treatment, it's not that it's an unintentional side effect of the treatment. The treatment is you end the pregnancy. That is I think abortion. Yet the Government has stated that is not abortion because it knows it cannot ban abortion in those circumstances. However, if abortion is right in this circumstance, why is it not right in other extenuating circumstances? That is why the Government tries to say abortion is not abortion in certain situations it knows it cannot ban. As regards suicide, we have an incredible situation where the Government puts the life of a woman at a much lower standing than the embryo she is carrying. Those who wish to enshrine this in legislation are eager to play down the possi[1132] bility of women in crisis pregnancies committing suicide. Happily, it is not a common occurrence, but it is a possibility and it should be provided for in law. The master of the Rotunda Hospital, when dealing with this point, said: In medicine it is very dangerous to say things don't happen. I certainly was of that opinion but last year – the first time again – we had a woman – I had never seen it before – was brought into hospital, attempted suicide quite far on in the pregnancy, and it was a very serious suicide attempt, so it can happen. When you are dealing with humans you simply can't say it never will happen. There is a real and substantial risk to the life of some women from suicide because of crisis pregnancies, but the Government wants to trample on the right of a woman to safely terminate a pregnancy in such a situation. It is justifiable that the woman has the right to choose a termination in other cases. There is no question about it in the case of rape. If there is a violent attack on a woman, which is a crime of unspeakable proportion to begin with, and that crime is compounded by the woman becoming pregnant as a result, it is monstrous to force her to continue with such a pregnancy. It is reprehensible that a male dominated Parliament would seek to compel a woman in the State to continue with such a horrific pregnancy in such circumstances. A woman is justified in choosing to terminate a pregnancy which is caused by the violent acts of a man. Let no one be in any doubt that if the male species was transmogrified overnight and could become pregnant, the male dominated Parliament in the State would not compel men to carry the pregnancy through to a conclusion in the event of rape. As regards incest, particularly of young children, it is entirely justifiable that the woman concerned should have the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy which occurs in such tragic and criminal circumstances. If a woman opts not to terminate, every support should be made available to her. All counselling, psychological and financial aids should be provided but if a woman wishes to terminate a pregnancy, that must be respected. The Bill is laced with hypocrisy and goes as far as to state categorically that the right to travel to avail of an abortion in another state or the right to information in regard to abortion facilities in other jurisdictions are not interfered with. The Government's message in the legislation is to point the way to England for the thousands who experience crisis pregnancies in Ireland on a yearly basis. England is used by the Government and the Establishment as the convenient safety valve to deal with the problem they do not want to address and to allow women with crisis pregnancies to escape this jurisdiction. If England or any other jurisdiction with safe facilities for terminating pregnancies for women [1133] who opt to do so did not exist, Ireland would be faced with a different dilemma which the Government of the day or the Establishment could not escape because it would then be faced with the horrific reality of unsafe and back street abortions resulting in the deaths of women or the crippling of their health permanently. Undoubtedly, there would be an outcry that this would have to stop, even by those who find it morally difficult or objectionable to countenance abortion. A total of 80,000 women die each year as a result of complications from unsafe or back street abortions. Most die in the poorer areas of the world ruled by dictatorial regimes where abortion is banned and abortion facilities are not provided as of right. Abortion is a difficult issue. I respect fully that many people have moral objections and in their own case would never choose to have an abortion. Their choice should be fully resourced and supported but, equally, the only solution to this problem is that the choice must be left to the woman at the centre of the problem. It is repulsive to again hear Fianna Fáil politicians and others loosely tripping off their tongues terms such as 'the danger of social abortion', 'abortion on demand', etc., trivialising what is at any time, no matter what is one's view, an extremely difficult and painful decision for a woman. Politicians should read the stories of women in the book, Irish Journey, which was published recently. Above all else they speak about the silence imposed on them regarding the trauma they have gone through and the difficulties they had. They are condemned largely to silence because of the hypocrisy of the Establishment. A total of 100,000 women have made the journey abroad over the past 20 years. A substantial number of people, including partners and families, have had to deal with the reality of abortion as opposed to the theory. It is time we faced up to the issue honestly. Committee Stage must be taken in the House so that there is adequate time for every Member who wishes to contribute. If the referendum takes place, the constitutional amendment will be defeated in the same way as the Nice referendum by a combination of those who are opposed to the criminalisation of women envisaged in the Bill and a collection of the more conservative elements in society who object for their own reasons. It will, therefore, be a wasted exercise. I finally turn to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. There should be an agency and every support for crisis pregnancies but I condemn the fact that the establishment of the agency was delayed to coincide with the presentation of the anti-abortion Bill, when it could have been established years ago to support women facing these difficult circumstances. That was done again for political reasons to pretend that the agency was dependent on the legislation being passed. That is not the case and the agency could stand on its own. It should be properly resourced and brought into being immediately.;3242406

I make that criticism specifically of Deputy Shatter, not Deputy Barnes whom I know has a genuine concern on the issue. Deputy Shatter, however, has no genuine concern on it whatsoever. He is merely deploying the usual rhetoric of opposition. We now need to look at the Labour Party which is taking an each way bet on the issue. Its party conference is conveniently voting for the pro-choice position while the leadership is rapping it on the knuckles and stating it would like to see the matter go another way. It is not unusual nowadays within the Labour Party to want an each way bet and claim victory no matter what the result. Conference delegates will claim victory if it is defeated while the leadership will claim victory if it is passed. It is typical of the confusion that seems to exist in the Labour Party. I suspect that we will see more confusion in the months ahead as to whom it will choose as a coalition partner. No doubt it will try to confuse its own delegates on that issue too.

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Conor Lenihan;Fianna Fáil;—a solution that could get over the essential hypocrisy on the issue. For once it is not hypocrisy in this House, but hypocrisy among the public. In 1992 it voted for quite contradictory things. It voted for the right to travel – to the United Kingdom or elsewhere – to secure an abortion and the right to information about how to travel and how to obtain an abortion. As we know, it did not vote for the proposal in relation to the substantive issue. In effect, therefore, public opinion is hypocritical. There is a central defining hypocrisy in the Irish mind on the issue. It wants women to have the right to travel and the right to information, but does not want to have abortions performed within the State. Between those twin positions the political class must come up with a reasonable and workable solution. That is what the Minister, Deputy Martin, has done. His proposal is reasonable, practicable and addresses the particular issue. It would not be responsible for any Government to advocate the pro-choice position in the full knowledge that it would be defeated by the electorate. That would be a wasteful, damaging and injurious exercise. We need to look at the practicalities of the issue. The supporting legislation and agencies being put in place to provide backup for women in crisis pregnancies are a positive development. Fine Gael played a positive role in relation to the all-party committee on the issue in bringing forward the idea of a crisis agency. That is something that has changed in the House since the 1980s. [1110] Then it seemed that the public and politicians were blithely prepared to pass a pro-life amendment to the Constitution and forget about the consequences and the people tragically caught in these particular circumstances. Politicians in the 1980s wanted to ignore that underlying reality. Today's politicians are not prepared to do so and have provided within this legislation a supportive framework. That is appropriate and right. I acknowledge the positive role played by Fine Gael in relation to it. I hope it will come round and support the actual campaign when it gets under way. Most of us know that many Fine Gael Deputies will vote one way in the House and listen earnestly to their spokespersons on the issue and will then go to their constituencies and advocate a 'Yes' vote. That could be called hypocrisy, but on this issue it only reflects the complexity of the debate, even within political parties. In Fianna Fáil there are many who would advocate the pro-choice position, but they will remain quiet and silent throughout the campaign. That is their choice. The political class should not campaign in the vigorous, no holds barred manner that it normally does on this particular issue. It should focus on the conveying of information. If the Opposition has concerns they should be expressed in a reasonable and proper manner and not in a scaremongering way. I am not sure when would be the best time to hold a referendum on this issue but it must be resolved well before a general election and this would indicate a referendum in the early part of the new year. The Minister may address this question when he closes the debate. It is important that the debate throughout the country is conducted in a proper manner. Notwithstanding her heartfelt and deep seated reservations and concerns, I hope the tone of Deputy Barnes's remarks do not mean she intends to scaremonger and attack the issue aggressively.;3242425
1921;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Eamon Gilmore;The Workers' Party;I oppose this Bill. My party and I are opposed to the Government's attempt to foist on the people another referendum on abortion. I am opposed to the proposed amendment to the Constitution which is contained in the Bill and which will reduce the equal right to life of mothers which is part of the Constitution. I am also opposed to the Bill's attempt to overturn the decision made by the people in a referendum in 1992 arising from the Supreme Court's judgment in the X case. It is something of a cliché to state that people do not want another referendum on abortion. I believe this is generally the case, although I acknowledge that some people want another referendum. However, that is not the reason this Bill is before the House. The Bill is before the House because Deputies Fox, Blaney, Healy-Rae and Gildea want a referendum on abortion. These Deputies have made the holding of such a referendum a condition of their continued support for the Government. That is the sole reason this Bill is before the House. This proposal is before the House because the Taoiseach promised the four Independents who support the Government that he would hold a referendum on abortion in return for their continued and loyal support. To be fair to the Taoiseach, when he makes a political deal, he keeps it. However, this Bill and the proposed referendum on abortion are products of a political deal. In essence, what is happening is that Deputy Fox is prepared to come into this House and stand shoulder to shoulder with her constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, over his lamentable handling of the Sellafield and nuclear safety issues, provided she gets a referendum on abortion. Deputy Healy-Rae is prepared to vote for the dismantling of parts of the [1136] local government system to which he has given a lifetime of service, provided he gets a referendum on abortion. Deputies Blaney and Gildea are prepared to vote with the Government on health, education and other issues about which they would normally be concerned in their constituencies, provided they get a referendum on abortion. I normally take political deals and their consequences with a degree of equanimity. However, we must oppose such deals when their price and currency is to play some kind of coalition roulette with the lives of women and mothers. The price of this referendum and this political deal will be paid by women for generations to come. I am particularly surprised by the Progressive Democrats' participation in this squalid deal. I could not believe my eyes and ears when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, attended the Government's press conference to advocate support for this referendum. If the referendum goes before the people, I would find it hard to believe that Deputy O'Donnell would go into the privacy of a polling booth and vote for it. If that is the case, I do not understand how she can come into this House and vote for it. Neither can I understand the position of Deputy O'Malley. When this issue was before the people ten years ago, he stated: We must be willing to consider the fact that some very unusual suicide case may arise where a woman cannot for some reason or another leave the jurisdiction and where a real and unavoidable risk of self-destruction exists. For example, a young pregnant girl may become severely anorexic after a multiple rape. Acting Chairman: Does the Deputy have a reference for the quotation?;3242426

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Conor Lenihan;Fianna Fáil;Fianna Fáil got it right in 1992. The people may not have voted for the substantive issue but the rights to information and travel were the important issues at that time. Deputy Barnes rightly spoke about the young girl at the centre of that controversy. As far as she and her family were concerned the rights to information and travel were the substantive issues. It ill behoves us to talk about that matter because the young girl involved is now a young woman and has made her own life. The less we talk about her the better. The rights to information and travel, which were most important to the family concerned, were copperfastened so that a similar case could not recur and an unthinking and insensitive State could no longer stop a woman achieving what she wanted to achieve in this regard. Dr. Upton: I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate on the protection of human life in pregnancy. The current view that is being ascribed to the Labour Party in relation to abortion – supposedly abortion on demand – is not one to which I subscribe. I am opposed to the decision taken by some members of the party at the recent conference, if the interpretation of that debate was to infer that abortion on demand was the agreed outcome. I hope Deputy Lenihan will understand my clarification of this matter. For many years the statistics on the numbers of abortions on Irish women taking place outside the jurisdiction of the State have continued to shock us. In a modern outward looking society there is still a sense of shock at the increasing number of Irish women purported to travel to Britain annually to terminate crisis pregnancies. The tragedy of these statistics is that the relative effort and support dedicated to the prevention and management of crisis pregnancies has been dismal. The support given to vulnerable young and not so young women who find themselves in a crisis pregnancy has been appallingly poor. Compared to the supports dedicated to other problems in Irish society, the support for women with crisis pregnancies is embarrassingly small. The education, treatment, counselling and management of unfortunate victims of drug abuse, for example, receive moderately good support. Large tracts of public money have been set aside to research the causes and symptoms and to provide for the needs and treatment of drug addiction, and rightly so. The amount of resources dedicated to the management of the drugs problem is still far short of what is needed, based on the current level of abuse of illegal substances. A high profile campaign was launched recently to reduce the level of smoking. Large amounts of public money have been spent on this campaign, and rightly so again. These are just two very worthy examples which are entitled to full support but there is surely a [1112] reasonable expectation that crisis pregnancies should be given the same level of support, counselling and management. The State has a responsibility to ensure the rights of all individuals, including the unborn. It is not fair or just that supports and services for some crises fall far short of the norm that is provided for many others. Money has been well spent in supporting sports activities, for example, and there continues to be a great need for better sports facilities. Earlier this year it seemed probable that £1 billion could be used for the building of a sports stadium that would be available largely to the sporting elite. I could continue with the list of social needs which have been or are being addressed by substantial investment of State money, yet when we look to the fundamental question of support for the protection of human life in a most basic way it is clear that it has dropped off the agenda of supports for crises and social concerns. Only last month a commitment was finally given for financial support for women with crisis pregnancies with the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. The sum of money promised – £5 million for 2002 – is a mere drop in the ocean compared with the real need of those women who are in crisis pregnancies. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been set up with a brief to co-ordinate existing voluntary and non-governmental agencies. I welcome the establishment of this agency but it should be given substantially more resources than have been committed to it. On the basis of a reported 6,000 women travelling to Britain every year for abortions, the amount set aside for the agency amounts to less than £1,000 per crisis pregnancy. This does not rate as placing a significant value on the protection of human life. For a number of months while the all-party Oireachtas committee was debating the complex matter of abortion, the number of Irish women travelling to England for abortions continued to increase. The work and subsequent report of the committee were very welcome but the number of abortions continued. The social stigma that was once associated with unwanted pregnancy has abated somewhat. However, it is still difficult for a young woman to access the necessary supports, to be assured of a quality child care service that will allow her to continue her education, to be guaranteed an acceptable level of accommodation, to be assured that she will be able to live a quality of life that will not restrict her social and personal development and at the same time assured that her child will be secure, safe and socially well adjusted. Education designed to ensure young women do not become pregnant is a first target and an area where significant resources must be invested. There is no problem with providing information for young people on the dangers of alcohol, other drugs or smoking. The same commitment should be given to sex education so that young people are well informed and aware of the risks of unplanned pregnancies and the possible risk of [1113] sexually transmitted diseases. The number of teenage pregnancies continues to increase and the underlying causes of this must be addressed through education and information for young men and women. Last week a national newspaper carried a report of a young woman who had chosen to have an abortion because having another child would have obliged her to give up her career. Having children and a career should not be mutually exclusive. If this country truly values its women it will provide the level of support, care and opportunity that allows a woman to continue with a pregnancy and a career. The care and support for women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies have largely been left to voluntary organisations which have few resources with which to offer support and are very often dependent on good will and, effectively, charity. The prevention of crisis pregnancies and the follow through for those women who become pregnant have never been given the same level of care and consideration as other social problems. Many teenagers drop out of school due to crisis pregnancies. This group must become the focus of a much enhanced support network. The vicious circle of disadvantage, which is linked to lack of education, will continue unabated unless the necessary supports to allow young women to continue in education are provided. For those who have already dropped out and now find themselves unable to find a job, provision must be made to allow them to return to education. Re-entering the education field, however, is about much more than returning to a classroom. Child care needs to be addressed through major investment and support. Quality affordable child care must be available to allow young women to complete or resume their education. Enhanced social welfare payments should be provided, linked to school attendance and completion of courses, if necessary, to give these young women with commitment the opportunity and incentive to reintegrate and achieve an appropriate level of education. There are many heart-rending accounts of women who felt they had no choice but to have an abortion and many sad and moving accounts of women who chose to have their baby and were rejected by family or society. This attitude and mindset must be changed, coupled with appropriate supports. I welcome the commitment of the Government to provide the resources to support women in crisis pregnancies, but the level of commitment and support, not just financial, needs to be greatly increased to give any woman who feels vulnerable or threatened the opportunity to ensure her quality of life and that of her child is not compromised. The culture of secrecy and fear which has dominated Irish thinking on crisis pregnancies must be replaced by a culture of openness, care and security. There are a number of issues in the Bill which are far from clear and give rise to concern, some [1114] of which may just be matters of detail that can easily be clarified. However, the lack of clarity raises a concern about the substantial intention of the Bill, for example, medical practitioners of any hue or training are to be allowed to perform the medical procedures. Despite the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea's passionate defence of the Bill he is entirely wrong to dismiss the use of the term 'medical practitioner' as unimportant. I have raised before in this House the question of alternative practitioners, a group not governed by legislation. Under the proposal in the Bill there is nothing to stop such a practitioner, or anybody who cares to classify himself or herself as a medical practitioner, from carrying out the prescribed medical procedure. Deputy Roche emphasised that philosophical, moral and theological questions are to be ignored in the Bill. Surely the voting public needs to know the very implications of the questions he dismisses. He also submitted that irrelevancies should not be addressed and added that we come, as legislators, to have a reasoned debate. It is precisely for this reason that it is important we avoid the fudge factor and address the detail of the Bill in order that when the question is put we are all very clear on what we are being asked to decide. Deputy Lenihan referred to confusion in the Opposition parties. There is a lack of clarity and a degree of fudge in the detail of the Bill and the Opposition parties have by no means a monopoly of confusion as far as the Bill is concerned. I was intrigued by the Deputy's proposal that his colleagues remain silent. This is hardly a responsible way to discharge one's duties as a legislator.;3242432

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Tony Killeen;Fianna Fáil;I welcome and support the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, which will provide constitutional and legislative protection for human life in pregnancy. It is a reasonable, comprehensive, fair and compassionate response to a difficult topic. The Medical Council's guidelines from 1993 and 1998 have provided a de facto legislative substitute in relation to abortion in recent years, which is hardly to the credit of this Parliament. Although we have waited for this Bill and the constitutional amendment, at least they are here now. Some of the criticism of these Houses that has been heard in recent years, especially since the X case, has been warranted. Certain issues needed to be addressed by the Oireachtas, but they were ignored. It was not as though the issues could be addressed in a day or a week or a shorter length of time and it is understandable that it has taken so long. I welcome the fact that comprehensive legislation, which includes a proposal for a referendum, has been brought forward. Taking up the point made by Deputy Durkan, there may well be merit in revisiting this legislative model in the future, although perhaps not for the issues he mentioned. There may well be instances where it will be desirable to enshrine legislation in the Constitution. It is something that future Parliaments may look at. I find it difficult to follow the logic of those who oppose the holding of the referendum and the discussion of the Bill on the grounds that they have not had enough time to absorb the issue. I could understand if somebody outside the Houses made that point, but it is difficult to understand why Members do so. Deputy Durkan made a good point when he said that politicians should be wary of making [1160] pre-election promises. It is good advice, regardless of the issue under discussion. Political leaders find it difficult to resist making such commitments when the battle has commenced and when rumours are circulating that other parties are about to make promises. Although we may consider ourselves to be clever parliamentarians, we have to admit that various lobby groups frequently outfox us. Despite the sophistication of party machines, individual candidates give commitments when adrenalin is running a couple of weeks before an election and they later find they are surprised to have made such promises. I do not make my comments with specific regard to the issue of abortion as the status quo could not have been maintained, even if no commitment had ever been made. I doubt if circumstances could have led to a better resolution of this problem than that proposed by the Government. There has been much debate on the matter in Oireachtas committees in recent years. Although many people will disagree with me, it is fair to say that a huge majority of those who voted 'Yes' in the 1983 referendum disagreed with the subsequent Supreme Court interpretation. Many people were sympathetic regarding the specific case and may have understood the leeway afforded by the Supreme Court decision, but the overturning of the referendum, which was the de facto outcome of the Supreme Court judgment, was a step too far for many people. The question of whether male Members of the House or male members of society are entitled to hold a view on this matter has been raised and they are, but female Members of the House and female people in society have a valid but different perspective which they manage to put across to the men in their lives strongly enough for it to be taken on board. It is a very high standard to set for legislation or for a constitutional referendum that it should forever more comprehensively address the issue under consideration. It is not a fair benchmark to set for any legislation or constitutional amendment. The only reasonable requirement is that it should address the current situation as comprehensively as possible and provide for reasonably foreseeable circumstances. We would do well to take a commonsense approach to issues that come before the parliament and make the best judgment we can on the basis of current knowledge. That is what we are doing on this occasion and the great majority of people who have contributed to this debate have done so along lines of commonsense, compassion and justice in the interests of seeking to do the best that can be done. It is interesting to listen to the veterans of the campaigns of 1983 and 1992. Although I have been here quite a long time, I was not here for either of those debates and that gives me a different perspective.;3242433

1930;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Eamon Gilmore;The Workers' Party;I will supply that reference. The Deputy continued: 'Such a girl with her unborn could be condemned by this amendment with the hands of the Supreme Court tied, thus preventing any sensible intervention to save her life.' Nothing has changed since then. This Bill is about removing suicide as a grounds or justification for availing of an abortion. Deputy O'Malley was so strong on this issue almost ten years ago, yet we are led to believe that his party will support this proposal in the House. Similarly, I cannot believe that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, will vote in favour of this measure. Close observers of exchanges in this House will have noted the significant differences in the replies given by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harney, as to whether this referendum will be held. The Taoiseach stated that the referendum will go ahead and indicated it will take place next February. This appears to be the case as we are debating the Bill in November. However, Deputy Harney seems to be implying that no agreement has been made on the date for the referendum and that it may not be held. It appears the Pro[1137] gressive Democrats, embarrassed by the support they have given to this measure to date, are now seeking refuge in not having the amendment put to the people. The Constitution is not the place to deal with an issue which is as complex and, ultimately, as personal as abortion. I was opposed to the 1983 referendum and campaigned against it. I have opposed the holding of another referendum and I believe legislation should be introduced to give effect to the X case decision. I very much recall the debate in 1983. During the course of it when it was argued that exceptional circumstances might arise, when cases like the X case and C case, which eventually occurred, were being postulated and when it was suggested that they would cause enormous legal, constitutional and human difficulties, those who supported the referendum argued that these cases could not happen. The argument that it cannot happen is again a feature of the debate we are having at present. The essence of the current proposal is to remove suicide as a grounds on which an abortion may be permitted. I find it astonishing that this is being seriously considered. Is it being suggested that illness or risk to life comes only in physical form? Surely after 100 years of the separate discipline of scientific psychology and after a couple of 100 years of psychiatric medicine, it must be recognised that there are behavioural, psychological and mental factors which may give rise to a risk to life. Is it also being suggested that medical practitioners are only to be entrusted with decisions in these matters where their practice relates to physical medicine and not to the practice of behavioural or psychiatric medicine? If, for example, a woman presents as suicidal no matter what the circumstances – for example, a woman who may be very seriously mentally ill – it is now being included in our legislation and with the force of the Constitution that medical practitioners may not intervene in that pregnancy no matter what the risk to her life. No matter how one can dance on the head of the pin, that is reducing the rights of that woman and the so-called equal right to life of that mother. That relates to what is being excluded by the Bill. However, we also have to look at what is in the Bill and what we propose to put in our Constitution. Up to now abortion has been regarded as a physical operative procedure performed usually a number of weeks into pregnancy and performed in a medical facility or hospital. That situation is changing due to two developments, in particular. First, pregnancy testing can now be undertaken at a much earlier stage of the pregnancy and, second, post implantation pills are now being developed – some have already been developed and are available – the effect of which is to induce a termination of pregnancy. I suppose, and without being flippant about it, what is being developed is probably the 21st century version of the bottle of gin and the hot bath. Let us move a number of years forward. The [1138] abortion response, if one can put it that way, to a crisis pregnancy will not be what our experience of it has been to date – in other words, the pregnancy test takes place two or three weeks into the pregnancy, there is a number of weeks of agonising by the woman about what she is going to do and then she makes an arrangement to have a physical abortion in a facility in the United Kingdom. In ten years' time or probably much earlier than that – arguably even now – a pregnancy test will take place within a couple of days of pregnancy and a pill will be available which will induce a termination of pregnancy. Let us look at what is in the Bill and how it responds to that. The Bill defines that as an abortion because it states that abortion means the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation. What that means is that the taking of a pill in those circumstances would be regarded as an abortion. The Bill then goes on to define that as an offence which is punishable on conviction by up to 12 years in prison. Let us think about what we are putting not only into the legislation proposed here but into legislation which will have the force of the Constitution and which cannot be changed without a change in the Constitution. We are going to create a criminal offence that can put a woman in prison for 12 years for taking a pill which will induce a termination of pregnancy. We are not just saying that – we are going further. What is being proposed is that if one attempts to do so, one will also be guilty of an offence. For example, a woman who has the pill in her handbag could be charged and convicted under this legislation because section 2(2) states, 'For the purposes of this section, a person shall be presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his or her conduct '. Similarly, a doctor who assists a woman or who prescribes the pill would be guilty of an offence. Let us deal with the 'it cannot happen' scenario. Given the way life goes on in this country and the way society sometimes deals with these things, even if this provision is put into the Constitution, we all know women are taking the abortion pill, as it may be called, and life carries on. What happens if a complication arises? Sometimes people can have a bad reaction to taking a particular pill or form of medicine. If a woman has a bad reaction and goes to her doctor, what happens then? Is the doctor required to report that a woman who has come to his surgery has taken a pill which is illegal not only under law but under the Constitution? What happens if a garda searching a woman's handbag under other legislation finds she has a pill which is not just banned in law but banned by our Constitution? If this legislation and referendum are passed, we will find ourselves back to the X case all over again. We will find ourselves in a situation where a women will be charged with an offence under this legislation for having taken the pill, about to take it or having it in her handbag and a file will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. [1139] Do not tell me it will not happen. It happened in the X case. The unexpected and the so-called impossible scenario materialised. If charges are brought, we will all sit around and hope the judge who hears the trial of the action will use his or her good judgment and common sense. We will all hope that not only will the woman not receive a 12 year sentence but that she will not even receive a 12 month or even a 12 week sentence for this offence. If a woman is sent to jail for even a day under this legislation, the telephone lines to Joe Duffy and Marian Finucane will be jammed. The telephone lines to every Member of this House will be jammed with people asking us what we will do about it. The reality is that by then, we will not be able to do anything because we will not be dealing with legislation but, according to this proposal, with the Constitution. It will be enshrined and embedded in the Constitution and it will not be able to be changed without another referendum. I understand and respect that there are differing views on the subject of abortion and that it is a complex and difficult issue that gives rise to complex and difficult ethical considerations. I ask Deputies, however, whether they agree that a woman should be sent to jail for 12 years for taking an abortion pill or for having an abortion of any kind. I put the same question, through this House, to organisations and individuals who urge us to have another referendum on abortion and place a complete ban on it. Do they agree with the proposal that women should be sent to prison for 12 years or for any period of time for terminating a pregnancy? This is not an abstract question because the provision in the Bill is black and white. Section 2(3) states that a person who contravenes section 2(3)(1), or attempts to do so, or aids, abets, counsels or procures any other person to do so, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 years or a fine or both. I do not agree that women should be sent to prison for terminating a pregnancy. I do not agree that we should create in this House criminal law which, by definition, applies to only one gender. Not only that, but it is criminal law which is to be enshrined in the Constitution. No matter what circumstances arise, no matter what opinions we may form in the future about the offence which is alleged to have been committed or the decision of a judge in a court case, we will not be able to change it in this House, as we would any other criminal law, except by way of a change to the Constitution. I urge the Government to rethink this proposal and withdraw it. In particular, I appeal to Progressive Democrats Members, who do not support this proposal unless they have had a most extraordinary change of mind, to oppose and vote against it. This is not something that should be put to the people. If it is, it should be defeated.;3242435

I started off by being persuadable for want of a better description. As each wave of persuasion came, I tended to go in the opposite direction, such was the degree of passion, for want of a better description, delivered in the course of correspondence and debate. I am glad there is a more rational debate on this occasion. I distinctly remember it being said at the time that the debate arose as a result of a promise made by party leaders before an election. If there is one lesson to be learned from this, it is to beware of making promises before elections, especially those that one might have difficulty keeping.;3242436

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Tony Killeen;Fianna Fáil;Many of the people involved in those debates were pursuing particular agendas. Even if I disagreed with some of them, I was prepared to allow that their beliefs were genuine and that they pursued their agendas with vigour and commitment because of those beliefs. In some respects this debate has been bedevilled, as perhaps all debates are, by people on opposing sides refusing to accept that what is said by people on the other side might be coming from some genuine base, perhaps fear of what change might bring or some other consideration. We need to be mature enough to accept that the considerations that inform contributions to a debate have validity in their own right. Deputies Barnes and Shatter were quite critical this morning, unfairly in some respects, of people who hold views broadly similar to mine. However, the arguments they presented were well thought out, clear and honest. Deputy Shatter frequently draws attention to deficiencies in legislation, even legislation passed by his own Government, as happened on one occasion. On that occasion it turned out that he was right in relation to legislation on marriage – I dealt with a few cases where difficulties arise because of that legislation. It is well to be open-minded and listen to the views of those who present clear and well thought out arguments, even if in the end one continues to disagree. One point which deserves further consideration – it is not central to this legislation but it is much more than peripheral to it – is the issue of adoption and the obstacles put in the way of Irish families seeking to adopt children. I can understand why it could not be centrally included on this occasion but it is a hugely important issue. The current situation reflects badly on us. We are far too mistrustful of those who are prepared to welcome children into their families. Part of the resolution of the difficulties of crisis pregnancy resides in the whole area of adoption. I hope we will deal with that much more comprehensively than we have done heretofore. Not having been here for the debates in 1983 and 1992 I believe the active protagonists in the debate laboured under the illusion that the debates were equally divisive outside this House and outside the milieu of the debates themselves. They were close to being irrelevant for the vast majority of Irish people. I was a reasonably well-informed 30 year old citizen in 1983 and the divisiveness passed me by entirely, as it did my friends, colleagues and family. We all weighed up the evidence and voted according to our best judgment. That is all we can expect of people on this occasion, and that is what will happen when this is put to the people. One of the paradoxes of modern liberalism – and I seek to be as liberal as I can – is that it sometimes seeks to marginalise and vilify people of orthodox Catholic background. Despite being in many ways considered a man of the world I [1162] attend mass and the sacraments. I strongly believe in the power of prayer and I find great support and consolation in my religion. At one time I could have said that with impunity, but I realise that nowadays those relatively innocuous statements make me almost a figure of ridicule for some in liberal circles because their liberality extends only to those who agree with them. There is a remarkable intolerance of people who do not share their views. Despite my pitiful status as an arch-conservative, I voted 'yes' for divorce, 'yes' for the right to travel, and 'yes' for freedom of information. For all those things I might be at least equally vilified by people on the other side of the debate. In making these points I seek to bring into the debate a balance, or perhaps the perspective of the ordinary citizen in the street. All I have done on this occasion is to weigh the evidence. I followed the proceedings of the constitutional committee quite closely and found it enthralling. I listened to the arguments of the medical and the legal experts and found out many things I had not known. Having considered myself reasonably well informed, I was disabused of that notion early in the proceedings. Having had that opportunity to listen in, I believe the Bill before the House adequately addresses the outstanding issues, especially concerns about the life of the mother. I commend the Minister for having brought it to this stage. Like Deputy Bernard Durkan and several others who spoke today and previously, I am not burdened by any medical or legal training so I bring to the debate only the perspective of a lay person, at least on those points. The constitutional review committee did excellent work and produced an excellent report. I confess I did not read all of it. I found the bits that were of some importance and read them. Colleagues who served on the committee put in an extraordinary amount of time and effort on the kind of work that seldom gets noticed in the media and that will not bring them any political advantage when they face the people in the next general election. It is difficult to commit oneself to that kind of work in the House. Many other committees do similar work which is not recognised and which is greatly important in achieving a balanced outcome in terms of legislation. The level of participation by people who have been to the forefront on all sides in this debate was quite extraordinary and quite excellent. I listened to some of them and found them to be much more humane and sensible than my previous perspective of them would have judged. It was an excellent exercise for parliament to engage in and one that is to be commended. I hope the Members of the next Parliament will seek to continue it in relation to many issues where public participation can be facilitated and medical and legal experts, lobbyists and others with a particular interest in a subject can effect democracy in the old Greek sense that allows the people to participate in the work of the parliament. We are always wailing and [1163] bemoaning the fact that people do not vote in elections and are not prepared to sit in cold halls at branch meetings of political parties. We are always saying that people do not participate. Parliament has a role to play in encouraging participation. Virtually all the polls on this issue have shown that a substantial majority of people want the matter revisited in a referendum, although not all of them are in favour of the pro-life or pro-choice position. However, they want to have a say and there is good reason for taking account of that. There are good reasons for saying the current situation in relation to abortion and crisis pregnancy needs to be addressed. Many members of the public and the media distrust politicians. They feel they will have a greater say on this matter, regardless of the outcome, if it is put before them in a referendum, and that is true. We have tended over the years to make the mistake of not referring issues to the people on a frequent basis. Other countries, particularly Switzerland, have referenda several times a year on issues that Governments here would not dream of putting to the people. We have tended on balance to err on the side of excluding the people from decision-making. There are many issues we might usefully put before the people. Even if only 50% of people vote, as happened in 1983, or 40%, as in the referendum on the Nice treaty, they have the right to vote. Whether they exercise that right, they have made a decision. They have effectively participated by attempting not to participate. The essence of democracy is the right to extend to the people the possibility of participation in decision-making. I understand why people do not want this issue referred to the people. They consider it to be as divisive an issue outside the House as it is inside the House. While that is wrong, there is some validity in making that point. This debate is probably more political than it might have been 12 months or two years ago. We all know that everyone here, except those fortunate enough not to put themselves before the electorate again, will be knocking on doors in the near future. One's view of life is tempered by the fact that an election is imminent. No one can blame Opposition Deputies for not being able to resist the temptation to have a cheap or good shot at the Minister or the Government.;3242438
1934;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Michael Ahern;Fianna Fáil;This is a proposition that should be put to the people who are the final arbiters, especially on issues such as this. We should trust them, whichever way they vote. For the past 20 years Members of this House and those outside have been well aware of the concerns expressed on all sides of the issue. It would be a failing on our part if we continued to ignore the problem and the views expressed in society. Despite what Deputy Gilmore said, the Government did not depend on the support of Independent Deputies before it made the decision to put a referendum to the people. It was a matter discussed prior to the last election when we gave a commitment that it would be considered when we came to power. The Government did not set out to arbitrarily bring forward its own propositions, but established an all-party committee which did tremendous research and took great time before bringing its report to Government. It was well attended and assiduously supported by its members during the years that it sat. It listened to an unprecedented number of submissions from all sectors of society. It came up with three different proposals rather than one decision. The Bill before us is based on the proposal that the Government has decided to put to the people. The Bill was launched in October. It addresses the complex issues surrounding the protection of human life. It is important to remember that it is about protection. Listening to some contributions it would be easy to believe that it is about the destruction of human life, which is far from the truth. As it protects unborn human life, it ensures pregnant women will continue to have access to all necessary medical treatment if problems arise in the course of their pregnancy. This is one of the issues that helped defeat the previous referendum when it was felt that women would not have access to all necessary medical treatment if problems arose during their pregnancy. The Bill recognises this and should take away some of the fears present during the previous referendum campaign. Medical people acknowledge this. Irish maternity services have a high reputation. The Government is anxious that the law should protect best medical practice and remove any doubt about the legality of treatment that doctors may consider necessary when rare life-threatening medical conditions occur during pregnancy. This is something of which people must be informed. It must be made clear that best medical practice is available to those with problems during pregnancy. This is important for men also. Some imply that fathers have no interest in their wives or their children, but I do not hold to that theory. Both fathers and mothers have deep worries if anything goes wrong, although the mother will, naturally, have more contact with the child. This protection of best medical practice should take away concerns and the misconceptions about what will happen if the Bill is passed. Since coming to office the Government has engaged in exploring the issues in depth. It has [1141] listened to many individuals and organisations. Up to 100,000 submissions were made detailing views on the protection of unborn life. It considered ways of moving forward which can command the support of the people. It would have been wrong and a waste of time if it brought forward a proposition which was not well thought out and feasible in order that it might have a chance of success if put to the people. That success will be for the best possible motive – the protection of human life. The Government is aware that addressing constitutional and legal issues may have little impact on Irish women who choose to travel abroad for abortions. Many of those who participated in the consultation and discussion process which preceded the production of the Green Paper and later the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution have recognised this also. The study, Women and Crisis Pregnancy, commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and carried out by the department of sociology in Trinity College, was very useful in providing an understanding of the factors leading to crisis pregnancy and the experiences of women in this situation. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution identified a range of issues to be addressed in a strategy to combat crisis pregnancy. It also pointed out that several Departments, State bodies and voluntary organisations have responsibilities for aspects of these issues. The complexity of the programmes needed and the co-ordination necessary for their success requires a single planning focus. It proposed the establishment of an agency to draw up a strategy to combat crisis pregnancies, promote options other than abortion where a crisis occurs and provide post-abortion services. The agency would also have responsibility for overseeing implementation of the strategy. Having considered the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the Government decided to set up a statutory agency to be known as the crisis pregnancy agency. Some £6. 5 million is being provided by the Government to fund this new agency which will be established initially for a period of ten years. Not only will it deal with the health sector, but also with education, employment and housing. It is important for the agency to be all-encompassing, especially for the many single women who become pregnant. They not only require health care but also education, employment and housing. Preventative issues concerning the education of young people and adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles, will be addressed. Much concern has been expressed about the need to make women more aware of their options should they experience a crisis pregnancy, to enable them to consider these carefully and to assist them before making decisions about the course of action they want to take. This is another major area which will be addressed by the new agency. [1142] One of the conundrums in our society, where levels of education are higher than ever before and so much information is imparted via the mass media, is that many young people are not aware of the facilities available to help them in times of crisis. I hope the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will help to reduce these deficiencies. I wish to refer to another issue which was highlighted in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Concern was expressed that legislation on abortion might have implications for the use of the morning after pill. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution felt that legal uncertainties that might exist with regard to the morning after pill should be removed. These treatments are intended to prevent pregnancy and, as such, do not come within the definition of abortion as set out in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill. This legislation will, therefore, remove any doubts about the legality of emergency contraception in the form of the morning after pill and the IUD. The question of licensing any particular medicinal products will remain a matter for the Irish Medicines Board, the independent agency with responsibility in this area. The Bill would overturn the Supreme Court decision in the X case, including suicide as a ground for abortion and other aspects of the judgment which could introduce wide-ranging abortion services. It would recriminalise deliberate, intentional abortion for anyone who aids or abets it and would differentiate between abortion and cases where the baby may die or be harmed by treatment necessary to save the life of the mother, but where practicable effort must be made to preserve the baby's life. This is the first time this has been done anywhere in the world. It could be argued that the legislation is unattractively written and off-putting, but essentially it does the job it was intended to do and will be a definite brake on the development of an abortion culture in Ireland. Even though, theoretically, Ireland has had abortion since 1992, no legal abortions have been performed here due to the strict guidelines of the Medical Council as adopted in 1993 and 1998. However, things are changing and that may not hold in the future. That is one of the reasons it is necessary to have a legal underpinning for current medical practice. I would ask some people who are opposed to abortion and misunderstand the proposals to study them carefully and consider the consequences of rejection. If the referendum proposal were to be defeated it is most probable that abortions along the lines of the X case would follow some time in the future, and the situation may be further liberalised by court action if this loophole is not closed. I recommend to those individuals to heed what the Pope said in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, which stated: A particular problem of conscience can arise in cases where the logistical vote would be [1143] decisive for the passage of a more restrictive law aimed at limiting the number of authorised abortions, in place of a more permissive law already passed or ready to be voted on. Voting for such law does not in fact represent an illicit co-operation with an unjust law, but rather a legitimate and proper attempt to limit its evil aspects. People should take note of that pronouncement by the Pope. Some misinformation has been spread concerning the Bill, some of it through misunderstanding and some deliberate. Wild stories have been spread: that the Bill redefines life as starting at implantation, but it does not that it redefines the word 'unborn' and leaves the way open for experimentation on human embryos, but it does not and some even say that it allows abortion on demand up to 12 weeks. It does absolutely none of these things and people who make such statements should be challenged. I wish to make some comments on suicide in pregnancy as that issue is being bandied about a lot by those opposed to the legislation. Suicide is a rare event and the suicide rate in Ireland is approximately ten per 100,000 per annum. The risk of suicide during the year following attempted suicide is approximately 1%, which is about 100 times that of the general population. The most identifiable risk factors are: male sex aged over 45 years unemployment or retirement living alone receiving medical treatment within the previous six months or having a pre-existing psychiatric disorder. Pregnancy is not a risk factor in suicide. Pregnancy reduces the overall risk of suicide compared with the sector of the population that is not pregnant. In a study in the US, the estimated suicide rate for specific groups was: 0. 6 per 100,000 pregnant women 3. 5 per 100,000 non-pregnant women and 16 per 100,000 men. A study in England and Wales over a ten-year period found pregnant women aged 15 to 44 were 20 times less likely than non-pregnant women to commit suicide. Another study based on autopsy reports of all female residents in New York city, aged ten to 44, who committed suicide between 1990 and 1993 found that the number of suicides of pregnant women was only one third of that expected. Not only is the risk of actual suicide lower in, and following, pregnancy but also the incidence of parasuicide is low despite the high rate of psychiatric morbidity in pregnant and post-natal women. While pregnancy is a potent protector against suicide, induced abortion appears to be a risk factor. A review in Finland of 73 women who committed suicide between 1987 and 1994 found a mean annual suicide rate of 11. 3 per 188,000. The suicide rate associated with birth was 5. 9 and that associated with induced abortion was 34. 7. The report on confidential inquiries into maternal deaths in the United Kingdom 1991-1993 reports two deaths due to suicide within 42 days of the abortion and another two deaths in [1144] women known to be substance abusers who died of substance abuse overdose within one year of an abortion. Suicidal thoughts are relatively common in normal adolescent girls occurring in up to 16. 5%, while in girls referred for psychiatric treatment suicidal thoughts occur in 36%. Actual suicide rates for teenage girls were 0. 0003% for those aged ten to 14 and 0. 0034% for those aged 15-19 years. Prediction of suicide is at the basis of the decisions, relating to abortion, in Irish courts. Writing about the Supreme Court decision in the X case, Dr. Kelleher pointed out that suicide is a rare event and in all rare events the greatest likelihood is that the event will not occur. Research evidence indicates that medicine and psychology do not have the ability to predict suicide, even with a moderate degree of accuracy. Numerous studies have attempted to predict suicide in high-risk populations. The most thorough assessment showed that the prediction of suicide was wrong 97 times out of 100. There is no literature on the association between threats and completion of the act since threats are so common and completed suicide is so rare. Therefore, extrapolating clinically or statistically from threats to complete suicide is impossible. All those who attended the oral hearings and were asked about suicide agreed that it is much rarer in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. Those questioned included Dr. Seán Daly, master of the Coombe, Dr. Peter McKenna, master of the Rotunda, Dr. Anthony Clare, director St. Patrick's Hospital, and Dr. John Sheehan, consultant psychiatrist at the Rotunda Hospital. Even Dr. Alannah McGee, representing psychologists for freedom of information agreed when she said: Our evidence would concur with the general thrust of the findings that have been presented to you that completed suicide during pregnancy is significantly reduced over and above levels in non-pregnant women of similar ages. Dr. Anthony Clare and Dr. John Sheehan outlined the difficulty in predicting suicide. Dr. Clare referred to a statement from Dr. Kelleher to the effect that for every hundred cases of suicide predicted the prophecy was wrong ninety seven times. Dr. Geraldine Moane representing psychologists for freedom of information accepted this figure when questioned closely on the matter by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and she said 'certainly, they are 97% wrong'. A number of contributors referred to the psychological impact of having an abortion. Dr. John Sheehan, consultant psychologist to the Rotunda quoted from a Finnish study on suicide which found a six-fold increase in suicide after abortion. This study was cited by a number of other contributors. Perhaps the most telling analysis of the suicide question in relation to abortion was the statement of Dr. Anthony Clare: [1145] So if I were to summarise, I would say that the only real reason you will find psychiatrists involved in this is because we have been drawn in to try and get people off the hook over this issue. Who better than to get the psychiatrist to tell you that ‘if this is refused, this woman will kill herself.' Well no such statement can be made with any great safety whether the person making it is a psychologist, psychiatrist or a general practitioner. It is also worth noting the findings of the 1994 commission of inquiry, chaired by Lord Rawlinson, into the operation and consequences of the Abortion Act, 1967, in Britain, which concluded as follows: The Commission heard from witnesses representing the Royal College of Psychiatrists who stated that although the majority of abortions are carried out on the ground of danger to the mother's health, there is no psychiatric justification for abortion. Thus the Commission believes that to perform abortions on this ground is not only questionable in terms of compliance with the law but also puts women at risk of suffering a psychiatric disturbance after abortion without alleviating any psychiatric problems that already exist. It would be ludicrous to allow a procedure on grounds of suicide risk if that procedure itself increased the risk of suicide, as clearly demonstrated by the Finnish study. The response to those who are suicidal in pregnancy is to offer appropriate psychiatric help. The complete range of psychiatric services is available to these women and should be utilised in full. Those Deputies who continue to raise the issue of suicide as grounds for abortion are re-inventing the wheel and obviously have not read the contributions of the mental health professionals to the all-party Oireachtas committee. Their antics would seem to be a classic psychiatric case of denial – denial of what has been detailed in the report of the all-party Oireachtas committee on abortion and denial of the scientific information available on the risk of suicide in pregnancy. Deputy Owen pondered the question last week of why the body of psychiatrists had not publicly condemned the Government measures. The answer is that psychiatrists recognise that the disorders and behaviours they treat do no constitute grounds for abortion. If objectors on the Opposition benches really cared about women, instead of hurtling accusations of misogyny at speakers, they would welcome these measures and voice their concern at any proposal that sought to legislate for procedures, such as abortion, that place women at risk of suicide, instead of playing political and ideological football with this proposal and ultimately with pregnant women's lives and those of their pre-born children.;3242439

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Brendan Kenneally;Fianna Fáil;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. I commend and thank the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children [1150] and the Cabinet for bringing the Bill in its present format before the House. It is the result of a great deal of research, debate, thought and deliberation and represents the best possible solution to our legal dilemma. It best represents what the people have said consistently in successive referenda and is the best option for the future of Irish society. The proposal will overturn the Supreme Court decision in the X case, including suicide as a ground for abortion, and, perhaps more importantly, other aspects of the judgment which could introduce wide-ranging abortion. Other suggestions, which would further copperfasten the intended effect of this move, will be taken on board by the Government. No one has the monopoly of wisdom, especially in this 20 year debate, but the proposal contained in the Bill represents an honest attempt to finalise a debate and campaign which have dragged on for more than two decades. It could be argued that the legislation is unattractively written and off-putting. We have seen this type of legislation used effectively with regard to the Good Friday Agreement. The essential point is that it does the job it was intended to do and will act as a brake on the development of an abortion culture in Ireland. I welcome the possibility that it will be the ultimate solution, but I am realistic enough to know that, even if this measure is passed in the Oireachtas and approved by the people, medical advances, both good and bad, which are currently beyond our imagination, may force us to return to this Chamber in the future. We, or our successors, will have to deal with that. I am convinced, however, that this logical and reasoned amendment is the best possible course and will find favour with the vast majority of our people. Occasionally, legislation is presented in this House about which one can be totally positive. This is, thankfully, one such item. Few subjects generate as much emotion or controversy as abortion. Now that the debate is under way the media will be filled with opinions of every shade and hue and tempers will rise accordingly. Already we have seen the predictable articles from eminently predictable journalists, primed no doubt by equally predictable politicians, declaring that the last thing we need is another divisive debate and referendum campaign on the subject of abortion. I do not agree and their stance is the usual hypocritical one. Those who favour abortion often disguise the fact by using phrases such as ' the right to choose'. Change for them means the widespread availability of abortion. Change means making available what they claim to be a civil and basic human right of being able to kill another individual, albeit one still in the womb in the protection of its mother. How anyone could either reason for that or see any possible right or logic in the claims is beyond me. I believe it is beyond the comprehension of the majority of the Irish people who, at the end of this process, wish to see a legal regime in place which protects, not [1151] only the rights of every individual, but their dignity and right to life as well. That is what we are charged to bring about. That is our duty and that is what this measure sets out to achieve. Perhaps such people would like the old absolutist dictatorial way of no debate, only decree. It would suit their purpose to have their proposal slipped through on the nod, with little or no debate, no consultation and no opportunity to endorse the will of the people in a constitutional provision or even legislation. I support this Bill and would ask people who are opposed to abortion and misunderstand the proposals to study them carefully and consider what the consequences of rejection would be. If it were defeated it is most probable that abortion along the lines of the X case would follow sometime in the future and perhaps be further liberalised by court actions if this loophole is not closed now. One must give a certain grudging respect to the Labour Party, who on this occasion has shown no equivocation and has made its stance abundantly clear on the subject. It has gone as far as having its annual conference give it a clear direction in favour of abortion on demand and, by extension, the opposing of this measure before the House today. Fine Gael are less clear on its position, but Fine Gael does not seem to know which way to jump on any issue. All it can be sure of is that it will eventually choose the losing option. A certain expression from Fine Gael's past involving soup and a fork comes to mind. I think that so far – we have to acknowledge we are not very far advanced nationally with this debate – we have seen a colouring of the waters by the media and an emphasis that leads us towards a liberal abortion regime. I oppose that strongly. I consider it wrong, bad law and a very backward step for this country. I believe the proposal before us is the best option possible and is the result of proper preparation. There has been much misinformation spread about this Bill some of it through misunderstanding, some deliberate. Wild stories have been spread that it redefines life as starting at implantation, redefines the word 'unborn' and leaves the way open for experimentation on human embryos. Some even say it allows abortion on demand up to 12 weeks. It does none of those things and people who make such statements should be challenged. I repeat the same words I have spoken in this House before. I am not a spokesperson for the pro-life lobby or any other pressure group. If my views, opinions and beliefs run parallel to theirs, then so be it. I accept their right to campaign for a particular view, just as I accept the right of those opposed to put forward theirs. I do not see this as a Catholic Church or any other church issue. It is an issue of right and wrong, of what is acceptable in our society and what is not. Most of all, it is a matter of what has [1152] been approved and accepted by the people in the democratic privacy of the polling booth. That, and only that, is what is at stake here. The previous Government shirked its duty on this issue, but it will forever stand to the credit of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Government of today that it is now being tackled head-on and the path being chosen is that which has been dictated by the people in two referenda. On previous occasions, the intent of the Oireachtas was frustrated in this matter and once more we have to place our intent on the record and ask the people to endorse it. The simplicity of the proposal before the people and the comprehensive way it is being dealt with on this occasion leaves me in no doubt that the people will come out to vote and will give it their resounding approval. Loath as I am to mention the June experience, I feel that on this occasion the approach by the Government has been impeccable and will be shown to be so in the polls. There will be attempts to muddy the water. There will be the campaign of misinformation, some of which has already started. There will be the cry of 'not another divisive campaign'. By its very nature, any proposal being put to the people will show that there is a body of opinion for and against the proposal. That is the nature of politics. Every proposal is opposed for a variety of reasons, not all of which are even complementary. As one example of less than clear and responsible reporting, I quote from the Evening Herald of 4 October, where under the title of 'Abortion: Saga Goes On' Mary Carr attempts to give the background of the two decade history of the abortion debate. It is woolly to say the least and if it were not to have an effect on how people approach the matter at present, it is one piece which could easily be discarded. Under the sub-heading: 'It's back' it says: In 1983 the nation was convulsed by a bitter abortion referendum campaign. Now the issue that has divided Ireland ever since is back to haunt us. But how has it come to this – and why has Bertie Ahern decided to act now? Politics itself is divisive. There is a natural division of opinion in every facet of life, especially in politics, otherwise we would not have five parties represented in this House or the need for them. There are few enough questions on which there will be anything approaching unanimity, though I am convinced that the majority of people are still fully committed to a ban on abortion. In explaining the eighth amendment of the Constitution, the right to life amendment, Mary Carr states: In the early Eighties, there was a vigorous campaign from the Pro-Life campaign and the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child to have an amendment inserted into the Constitution prohibiting abortion. The argument was that abortions may one day be legally possible unless such a safeguard was in place. But [1153] aside from the vocal and well-funded pressure groups, no such demand was coming from the general public. Nevertheless, both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael caved in and committed to supporting such an amendment. There is an immediate suggestion there that it is in some way wrong to hold pro-life views. The parties we are told 'caved in' to doing what was right. That is a misrepresentation of the facts. The reason there was no widespread demand from the people for a referendum at that stage was that very few knew it would be required. It was a subject which was out of sight until brought to the forefront by the pro-life campaign. Thankfully, there were people alert to what was on the horizon, including members of Fianna Fáil, who had the foresight, commitment and courage to fight for constitutional protection for the unborn. Is there anyone today, almost 20 years on, who does not believe that without that campaign, which both alerted the people to the possibility of the introduction of abortion and eventually brought about the constitutional amendment, attempts would not have been made to have abortion brought in through legislation and on the pretext that it was a human right? I do not believe so. The people responsible for that chain of events have earned the gratitude of the people and I know that in time there will be a better understanding of the service they rendered to the people. Having sketchily traced the history of abortion to 1992 and the passing of two of the three amendments, the newspaper article asks why things cannot stay as they are. 'Politics' is the reply, suggesting that the sole reason for action is to retain the support of the Independents. Whatever validity might have been attached to this in the early years of the Government, given that we are within six months of a mandatory election, it will matter little when the next election is called or precipitated. This is just one more cheap shot, one which the people may choose to believe, but which is wrong. Everyone in this House knows that for the past nine years we have been in a legal limbo in regard to abortion and a situation has existed which should have been remedied by a referendum or legislation. Even taking two years to lay the groundwork properly and have the necessary consultation as well as publish a Green Paper seems to be a reason for criticism rather than an acknowledgement that a careful, prudent and proper course was followed. It appears that one is damned if one does and damned if one does not and even when action is necessary and long overdue, credit cannot be given by some to the Taoiseach and the Government for having the courage to enter where the last Government feared to tread. The Herald also reported: The Pro-Life lobby have been fretting about the possibility of further court cases paving the way for a form of social abortion. They don't [1154] accept abortion can ever be the answer to a life-threatening medical condition. I am not a spokesperson for any organisation or lobby, but I do not think that a majority within or without the pro-life movement would totally disregard the threat to the life of the mother. I am aware and accept there are occasions where applying medical procedures to save the life of the mother results in the death of the foetus. This has widespread acceptance among the medical profession and the general public and to say otherwise is an outdated argument. Everyone agrees that the current legal position in regard to abortion needs attention. There is a division of opinion on how the problem should be tackled. Some argue for a legislative solution in order that down the line it can be easily re-entered, changed and altered all too easily. The opposite view suggests it should be tackled via a referendum. Given the people's clear indications on several occasions previously, any objective assessment would suggest this would be the proper course. The foundations have been laid, the groundwork done, and all the indications are that the current proposal represents the views of the people and, by extension, will find favour with them. This is one of our functions, to interpret and represent the will of the people and turn it into legislative action. I want to make my position clear on this matter. I am totally opposed to abortion, whether carried out in Britain or any other jurisdiction, and equally opposed to such a service being available here. Those who hold this view are regularly accused of exporting our problems. I do not agree. This is the only jurisdiction for which we, in this House, have a responsibility and we can only ensure that what happens here is in accordance with the wishes of the people and the law of the land. I would prefer if women did not go to Britain or elsewhere for abortions. I would prefer if they were actively encouraged and assisted to stay in Ireland and bring their pregnancy to a successful conclusion. That would be in their best interests in the long run and that of their baby. That is the reason I also welcome the parallel proposal to establish a crisis pregnancy agency to help achieve this and I am pleased that the Minister has done this in advance of the current proposal. It is long past time that the voluntary agencies, funded privately and voluntarily or by the Churches, were relieved of some of the burden of dealing with crisis pregnancies. I have no doubt that, through their work during the years, they have not only prevented a great many abortions, but saved mothers the subsequent trauma which inevitably follows an abortion. We should formally thank them for doing this work, which was at least as appropriate to the State as it was to the volunteer bodies. There is no quantifying the work they have done and the misery they have prevented. We could well wonder whom among those young people who walk our streets, attend our schools or toil in our work[1155] places, might have been denied an existence but for the intervention of these agencies. That is what it boils down to, people alive today who might otherwise have been consigned to oblivion. The title of the Bill indicates it is a positive measure. It is not couched in any anti-style of language, but proclaims that it is positively for the protection of human life in pregnancy. There is a new clarity, too, about what constitutes life before birth, which I also welcome. The legal and parliamentary mechanism whereby this provision is being inserted into the Constitution requires that similar legislation be enacted within six months of a successful referendum. I urge the Taoiseach to complete the business of having the legislation passed within the life of this Dáil in order that this difficult question can be solved once and for all. The public wants this matter brought to a finality and has indicated precisely in what fashion it wants this done. The current proposal fulfils that duty and I unreservedly support it.;3242441
1937;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Pat Carey;Fianna Fáil;The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, is the first legislative proposal since the Supreme Court decision in the X case in 1993 which seeks to honestly and comprehensively address the issue of abortion. It is the result of an exhaustive process which started in 1997 when the Taoiseach initiated the Green Paper on abortion. This led to the wide ranging consultations of the all-party committee on the Constitution chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan which published its detailed report in November 2000. The process, initiated in 1997, resulted in the most detailed legal, medical and social examination ever undertaken anywhere in the world of the sensitive issue of abortion. All those from many differing standpoints who participated in the process are to be commended for the manner in which the consultations were conducted. I was struck by the evident maturity with which people representing every shade of opinion approached the committee. They attended in good faith and put their case with conviction. The hearings were marked on all sides by a tone of mutual respect and a determination to adopt and maintain a measured tone throughout. I hope this House can conduct its business of moving the twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution in the same atmosphere of reciprocal [1115] regard for those with whom we disagree. Let us use moderate language. The matter is too weighty to be addressed in a tone of recrimination and name calling. For this reason I was disappointed by the tone of some Deputies' remarks in the opening weeks of the debate. Surely we are mature enough to debate without seeking to demonise each other. Calling those who differ from us misogynous raises the temperature and does not advance our understanding of the proposal one iota. If we are genuinely concerned about the welfare of women in crisis pregnancies and their unborn children, there is an onus on us all to conduct ourselves in a calm and reasoned manner. The Oireachtas hearings on the issue identified the key areas of consensus which laid the foundations on which the current proposal has been built. The broadest area of consensus is surely the universal sense that abortion is a terrible experience for any woman. It is a tragedy in every instance. No one who attended the hearings spoke of abortion as something positive, it was universally regarded as a negative experience. There was, however, a pervasive sense that we all have a grave responsibility to support women in crisis pregnancies, to be there for them in order that they do not feel abandoned when making their decision and put in place whatever practical supports they need to enable them to feel there are real and positive alternatives to abortion. Every crisis pregnancy represents an urgent call to all of us to do more to ensure women do not feel abandoned to cope alone. For this reason every woman who feels she has no real option other than abortion represents a failure on our part and of social solidarity because, as the people around her, the members of society, we have a civic responsibility to step in and put in place the full range of supports needed. We owe it to every woman who has had an abortion and to women who find themselves facing a crisis pregnancy in the future to commit ourselves to surrounding them with strong, warm, personal support and, as a society, to put in place an ample range of practical supports in order that there will be real and positive alternatives to abortion. I am an optimist. Our abortion trends are not irreversible. The numbers of women seeking abortions are distressingly high and rising, though lower than in most countries. These trends can be slowed down and eventually turned around by addressing the reasons that drive women to seek abortions in the first place. This is a central part of the role of the new crisis pregnancy agency chaired by Ms Olive Braiden, a respected person in her profession. As a recent Trinity College study, Women in Crisis Pregnancy, showed, the reasons many women seek an abortion are the very real practical problems posed by the unexpected pregnancy and the considerable difficulties involved in rearing a child alone. If we adequately address these [1116] difficulties, we will gradually begin to meet the real needs of women in crisis pregnancies and help to considerably reduce the abortion rate. The Government approach to this issue is being adopted at three separate levels, constitutional, legislative and social. The twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution will protect best medical practice in the care of women in pregnancy while at the same time restoring clarity to the law regarding the right to life of the unborn child. It is important to recognise that Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world in which to be pregnant and the Green Paper on abortion recognised that our maternal mortality rate could hardly be improved upon. The twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution takes account of the consensus of psychiatric opinion in the Oireachtas hearings against making a threat of suicide as grounds for obtaining an abortion. The evidence was starkly illustrated by the Finnish study from the Finland National Research and Development Centre, published in the British Medical Journal in 1996. This study compared the number of women in the general population of women of child-bearing age who committed suicide with the number among women who had a baby and with the number who had an abortion. They found that the number of women who committed suicide after having a baby was only half the number in the general population of women of child-bearing age but the number of women who committed suicide after an abortion was nearly six times more than the number of those who had a baby. Having a baby was strongly linked to a lower rate of suicide but having an abortion was very strongly linked with a significantly higher rate of suicide. If the legislation followed the line advocated by those Deputies on the other side of the House who are seeking abortion to be allowed on the grounds of threatened suicide the results could be expected to show a rise not a fall in the numbers of women committing suicide. The Government's proposal takes account of the consensus in the expert psychiatric testimony presented to the Oireachtas hearings. I remember the harsh criticism voiced in the X case rulings of the failure of the Oireachtas after 1983 to fulfil the duty laid upon it by Article 40. 3.3: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. The Oireachtas should have enacted a law to indicate how that balance should be kept how in seeking to preserve the mother's life, the doctor had also to keep in mind the need to preserve the life of the child as far as practicable, but it failed to do so. The twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution is a genuine attempt to discharge that responsibility, made more complicated by the X case ruling. The twenty-fifth amendment repairs [1117] the damage done by the Supreme Court ruling to the protection of the right to life of the unborn in Article 40. 3.3. The X case ruling breached the protection which the people intended to be provided to the unborn in Article 40. 3.3. by inappropriately foreshortening the protection to be extended to the unborn when seeking to preserve the mother's life. To repair that breach, the X case ruling needed to be reversed. The 25th amendment does this in two steps: by removing the threat of suicide as grounds for abortion in line with the expert testimony of the psychiatrists in the oral hearings by requiring the doctor when intervening to preserve the life of the mother to have regard to the need to preserve the life of the unborn, as far as practicable. It safeguards the legal availability to women of medical treatment that they may need if they face a risk to their own life in pregnancy, in line with the consensus among obstetricians and gynaecologists as established by the Oireachtas hearings. The proposal criminalises the intentional destruction of the unborn after implantation in the womb. It defines abortion for the purposes of the Act but does not seek to define where human life begins. The alternative approach to that being adopted by the Government is to legislate for abortion in line with the Supreme Court decision in the X case ruling which would allow for abortion up to birth. This is the reality of abortion laws in Britain and other countries. It would have the support of the official Labour Party although I respect that there are members in this House and elsewhere who do not see themselves as party to it. It would not, I believe, have the support of the Irish people. The Government proposals are a genuine attempt to confront the reality of crisis pregnancy and to address the very important issues relating to the right to life. I support the Bill and ask some people who are opposed to abortion and misunderstand the proposals to study them carefully and consider what the consequences of rejection would be. If it were defeated it is most probable that abortion along the lines of the X case would follow some time in the future and may be further liberalised by court actions if this loophole is not closed now.;3242442

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. John Browne;Fine Gael;(Carlow-Kilkenny): Nuair a thosaigh mé sa tSeanad sa bhliain 1983 bhí reifreann á phlé chun focail a chur sa Bhunreacht chun an bac ar ghinmhilleadh a dhaingniú. Bhí an bac ann i gcónaí ach ba é an plean an bac a chur isteach sa Bhunreacht. Tá sé suimiúil domsa go bhfuilim anseo, ag tarraingt ar dheireadh mo ré sa saol polaitíochta, agus go bhfuilim ag caint faoi reifreann chun focail eile a chur isteach sa Bhunreacht. Níl díospóireacht na bliana seo leath chomh fíochmhar is a bhí sí sa bhliain 1983. Is dócha go bhfuil ciall ceannaithe ag a lán daoine. Ba chóir, mar sin, nach mbeadh baol ar bith go mbeadh an toradh céanna againn is a bhí i reifreann 1983, nuair a thug an Cúirt Uachtarach breith ar na focail. An bhfuil an baol sin ann anois? Sin an cheist. Before the great debate of the early 1980s there were two definite positions in Ireland. The first was that abortion was banned by the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and the second was that doctors decided on the medical treatment needed by a pregnant woman even if this treatment led to the death of her baby. Why was there an amendment to the Constitution in 1983 which resulted in introducing legal abortion to this country? What have we gained from the 1983 effort? How much have we learned from it? Putting words into the Constitution to protect life was an attempt to adopt a belt and braces approach in case politicians went wild and introduced legislation to allow abortion. After approximately 20 years we are trying to get back [1165] to the stage where abortion is banned by legislation, as it always was, and doctors will make the necessary decisions. This is going backwards. Abortion is banned by our legislation without the need for any words in the Constitution. It is ironic that the inclusion of these words has left a loophole. I listened to almost all the debate today and while I respect everyone's views, I am amazed that some Members on the Government side seem to think this Bill is about having or not having abortion in Ireland. We are discussing a legal document. Abortion is banned in Ireland by the 1861 Act and doctors have the right to make decisions. That has always been the case. Is the Minister shaking his head?;3242443

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Tony Killeen;Fianna Fáil;Absolutely. It is important to bear in mind that the political context is different from what it might have been at another time. One argument which does not stand up is that the referendum is taking place because of the input of the Independents. It is fair to recognise and acknowledge that they have had an input, but other people have also had an input. If one was to take on board the views of people whose sup[1164] port was needed to keep the Government in power, would it not be better to do that earlier in the life of the Government to keep them on board? It does not matter if the election is in three weeks or in three or six months. The many people who support the pro-life view, as I do, must be more active than they have been in the past. The experience of the debate and the referendum on the Nice treaty was that most of the political parties assumed that because they were in favour of it, most of the people would also be in favour of it. Issues are usually more critically analysed by the people than we accept. This issue will also be critically analysed by the people – I hope it is a big number – who bother to make their way to the polls. It is important for those who have an interest in this issue to become involved and not to leave it to political people. I welcome the establishment of a crisis pregnancy agency, although I do not have time to go through the details of it. The Minister said in his speech that last year alone 6,500 women who had abortions in Britain gave Irish addresses. There has been criticism that the agency should have been set up two, five or 25 years ago. Perhaps that is a valid point. However, it is useful to set it up in the context of this debate, the proposed legislation and the constitutional amendment. I hope it will have a strong impact on the lives of those with crisis pregnancies who must make difficult decisions.;3242444

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. John Browne;Fine Gael;(Carlow-Kilkenny): That will be made clear later, but it is a mistake. The wording of the 1983 Act was suspect from the time Dr. Garret FitzGerald was advised by the then Attorney General that if it was challenged in the Supreme Court it would lead to abortion. I was at the parliamentary party meeting when that advice was given. The challenge came in the 1990s. The warning was correct and, mirabile dictu, the effort to copperfasten an already copperfastened case managed to blow it wide open. As a result there has been legal abortion since the X case. Dr. FitzGerald did his best to prevent this by introducing different wording but he had to suffer outrageous insults from many who were not fit to tie his shoe laces. Those who held strong moral views can be forgiven for their genuine zeal but many politicians of the day hardly deserve the nation's thanks for playing politics with a serious problem. The question is whether we will be in the same position regarding the new wording. With greater potential for challenging even some of the words, will the scope for abortion be further widened? The members of the Supreme Court will interpret any phrase or word that is challenged and the intentions of the voters will mean nothing. What happened to the wording in 1983 must be recalled. The debate is about what will happen the constitutional amendment when it is challenged in the Supreme Court and not about who supports or opposes abortion. Promising a referendum before an election may be a help in getting votes while doing so following an election may be a major help in acquiring the support of four Independents but promising a referendum without proposing definitive wording is akin to flying by the seat of one's pants. Inserting words in the Constitution has proved extremely difficult and, even though the [1166] Taoiseach knows this, he still promised a referendum five years ago without having any clue as to the wording. As proof of the ongoing difficulty the Minister for Health and Children stated when he opened the debate on behalf of the Government: 'The Government has concluded that there is no simple sentence or paragraph that can be inserted into the Constitution which by itself will amount to a balanced, effective legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy'. Almost five years since the Taoiseach said 'no bother' and following continuous debate over the past 20 years, including the months of deliberation by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, there has been a realisation that it is not possible to arrive at the correct wording, yet we have been presented with fresh wording for another referendum. I am not making this contribution because I am leaving the scene and not seeking re-election. I experienced awful bitterness in 1983 when it was almost dangerous to move around in public because of the belief that the wording would be interpreted as it was ultimately. I am baffled that the Minister has announced it is not possible to draft the correct wording and it will be patched up. Botched wording was proposed in 1983. Will the same be proposed in 2002? During his contribution the Minister also stated: 'The proposals are aimed at achieving a reasonable compromise'. There was no such thing as a compromise in 1983. It was a very black and white situation. One side spoke with the authority of God and the other was influenced by the devil. A compromise has been proposed. Who will be compromised? Will it be the pro-life lobby, the pro-abortion group, the Church or the Legislature? Are politicians playing politics with a serious problem once again? If some of the strongly held views of the past are no longer important, will there be apologies for the carry on in 1983, particularly for the way a good man such as Dr. FitzGerald was treated in his effort to do his best? He faced various accusations by people who were not fit to tie his shoe laces. When people realise that approximately 100,000 have travelled to England for abortions since 1983 they should ask themselves what effect had the 1983 referendum. Abortion was banned, doctors continued to make decisions and another referendum was introduced yet 100,000 women travelled abroad for abortions. What, as legislators, are we doing when we introduce various wordings? Some people miss the point. The Government and Opposition engage in a performance to insert wording in the Constitution that is supposed to be useful. What is the advantage of using compromised wording, knowing that the Supreme Court may be asked to define words and phrases such as 'unborn', 'the conception implantation difficulty' or 'medical practitioner', which Deputy Gay Mitchell pointed out should be defined as [1167]'registered medical practitioner'? I have received communications from the pro-life lobby, as I am sure the Minister has, questioning the definition of 'medical practitioner'. They pointed out that an individual who has been struck off the medical register for misconduct could be a medical practitioner. The Minister will probably amend the definition on Committee Stage. However, a problem could result if simple wording such as this gets through in the legislation on an issue such as this where every word is important. The wording will only mean something when it is challenged in the Supreme Court, not when it is put before the people. The legislation can be challenged by both sides and the Supreme Court will sit in judgment. If the word 'registered' is not included in legislation what will we be faced with in future? If after all the deliberations such a fundamental mistake can be made in the wording, are we leaving ourselves wide open to further interpretation by the Supreme Court that will negative any plans we have? The All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which sought an agreement on wording for the referendum, accepted a Fine Gael proposal to set up an agency to help pregnant women by giving them advice on their options. I am glad this agency will be set up. I hope it will help many women to change their minds about having an abortion in England and, above all, I hope the agency will give them help when they need it most. I have never tried to be subjective on this issue. I would not like to be a 16 year old girl who has been raped or pregnant in my innocence having to face my parents and make up my mind about what I will do. Those are awful situations for the female members of the community and I do not want to pontificate objectively because in the long run objective and subjective views are far apart on this issue. The provision of £5 million for the crisis pregnancy agency is to be welcomed as it provides scope for its establishment. Since the referendum will have no effect whatsoever on the number of women who travel to England each year, we can only hope that as the agency becomes established and women gain confidence in it, it will lead to a reduction in the number of abortions carried out on Irish women there. However, a referendum is not needed to establish this agency. Debate adjourned.;3242448

We would be accused of not making a serious contribution to the debate if we rattled on off the top of our heads as some people would love to see us do. There has been much misinformation spread about this Bill, some through misunderstandings, some deliberate. Wild stories have been spread that it redefines life as starting at implantation, redefines the word 'unborn' and leaves the way open to experimentation on human embryos. [1118] Some even say it allows abortion on demand up to 12 weeks. It does absolutely none of these things and people making such statements should be challenged. The 25th amendment has achieved the proper balance of protection. It writes into law the two-patient model of pregnancy that has always informed the ethos of Irish medicine. It also provides a secure legal foundation for current ethical medical practice. The 25th amendment is a humane and enlightened proposal worthy of our support and I commend it to the House.;3242450

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;I have a dreadful feeling of déja vu about all this. It was back in 1983 when Deputy Barnes and I sat together in this House and voiced concerns about the 1983 amendment which the Fianna Fáil party was hell-bent on putting to the people. It was in 1983 when Deputy Barnes and I in this House voted against that proposal and it was in 1983 when each of us in our contributions to this House predicted practically all the difficulties that have arisen from that proposal and predicted the manner in which the courts would interpret it. The latest abortion referendum proposal is built on a bedrock of hypocrisy, decorated in the colours of political expediency. It is a constitutional flagship which highlights the capacity of the Government parties and others outside this House to indulge in a denial of reality and self-delusion at a level only psychologically possible because of our proximity and easy access to England. In an area of human conduct which cannot be regulated by constitutional amendment because of the private tragedies annually affecting the lives of thousands of women, we retain an extraordinary post-colonial dependence on English termination services to preserve a national fundamentalist illusion of moral purity and superiority. This proposal has been described by some as yet another Irish solution to an Irish problem. That is not an accurate description. This proposal seeks to constitutionally fasten an English solution to an Irish problem. The constitutional and legislative architecture of this latest abortion proposal is supposed to be politically admired for its cleverness and cuteness in attempting to integrate fundamentally diverse positions. At the time of its unexpected publication and launch at a well-managed Government press conference it seemed that its very complexity was enough to warrant praise and support from commentators who are usually more sceptical and discerning. In the days immediately following its publication it seemed that to analyse the substance of what it is proposed we now do was likely to be portrayed as politically dangerous and unnecessarily divisive. Deputy Lenihan revisited that territory earlier this morning. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste presented this constitutional proposal as a consensus measure worthy of support. Too often in politics, the mention of political consensus is used to avoid direct [1119] and informed political debate on controversial, difficult and sensitive issues. Those issues frequently have a heavy theological overlay. After two decades of parliamentary agonising we should know better and we should confront reality. The proposed 25th amendment of the Constitution and the Bill to which its proposers intend to give a constitutional status is a morally bankrupt and pernicious Bill. Its political objective has nothing to do with any issue of substance. Its political objective is to enable the Taoiseach say he has delivered or attempted to deliver on his promise to hold a referendum. That is to shore up political support from his four Fianna Fáil dependent Independents until an election is called and to ensure, should any of them be re-elected as it is anticipated some may be, that when the next Dáil sits the Taoiseach can rely on their support and that they would be available to him should he again attempt to form a Government. That is the sole political purpose of this proposal. If it were not for Deputy Healy-Rae and his colleagues in this House, this proposal would not be before us and were it not for the Government's dependence on four Independents, the proposal would not be before us in the manner in which it is framed. In terms of the campaign run over the past 20 years by the self-proclaimed pro-life organisations, this proposal is a betrayal of the originally proclaimed objectives of its chief protagonists such as Mr. William Binchy. The original objective of those chief protagonists was to constitutionally prohibit abortion in all circumstances and to prohibit any termination from the moment of conception. This proposal is based on a denial of the principle that life starts from the moment of conception. In the best Orwellian traditions of the book, 1984, it redefines abortion to exclude any termination up to the time of implantation and gives legislative recognition to the fact already constitutionally acknowledged that abortions may be lawfully undertaken where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, except where the risk is posed by suicide. It is my personal view that an abortion should be permissible where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. However, until recently all of the self-proclaimed pro-life groups denied that mothers' lives were ever placed at such risk as to justify a termination of pregnancy. By engaging in word games and semantic gymnastics the Government's proposal hides the fact that it is not delivering the amendment proposal for which the supporters of Mr. Binchy and the Government Independents have campaigned throughout the lifetime of this Government. Mr. Binchy, who is quietly briefing a select targeted group of TDs in different parties of his happiness with the proposal, is at odds with his former ally, Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon, who understandably has denounced the proposal. Mr. Binchy is also at odds with and has caused great [1120] confusion for a large number of people who followed his lead in 1983 and in 1992, many of whom are writing to Deputies from the self-proclaimed pro-life perspective urging that this proposal be rejected. I remind those who look to Mr. William Binchy as the legal guru on this issue that it was he who conceived and gave birth to the original 1983 amendment. It is he who since the 'X' case has campaigned for another amendment and claimed it was the Supreme Court, not he, who got it wrong. The reality is that William Binchy and the small group around him have been proved consistently wrong on this issue over a period of 20 years. The advice they are giving to Members of this House and to members of the general public should not be trusted. I say this with regret because I regard Mr. Binchy as a lawyer of great eminence for whom I have much admiration across a broad range of legal learning. Unfortunately, this area is his Achilles heel. Unfortunately, in his pronouncements with regard to this very sensitive and difficult issue, which primarily affects the lives of women, he has been proved consistently wrong. In 1983, when we had the first debates in this House on constitutional amendments relating to the abortion issue, approximately 2,500 women were recorded as travelling from this State to England to effect pregnancy terminations. In 2001, it is estimated that 6,500 women will travel from this State to England to effect terminations. The objective of the 1983 amendment was to protect life, to discourage abortion, but the reality has proved entirely different. If the Government was serious in trying to encourage women in crisis pregnancies to take other options and not to go the termination route, the package of measures announced, essentially as decoration at the press conference held by the Taoiseach and his Ministers when the constitutional proposal was unexpectedly launched, would have been put in place four years ago. Why were those measures not put in place in 1997, in 1998 or in 1999? If the Government is truly serious about reducing the level of abortion, why have these proposals been produced only in the dying days of the life of this Government? If the Government is serious about encouraging options other than abortion in crisis pregnancies, in the almost five years of this Government's life why has a single step not been taken to modernise our adoption laws to make them more user-friendly to women in crisis pregnancies and to make the option of adoption more attractive to pregnant women who feel they are not in a position to care for a child? The Government has failed to do anything in that regard. This proposal is bringing us back to the future. We are revisiting Deputy Reynolds's 1992 proposal when he was Taoiseach. Suicidal pregnant teenagers and women are to be denied the possibility of a pregnancy termination here. With great cynicism and a total lack of humanity the Taoiseach has explained, as has his Attorney General in a sort of folksy way, that this is okay because [1121] they can all go to England. It is Government social policy that we should export distraught, raped and suicidal teenage girls who wish to terminate a forced pregnancy across the water to preserve a self-delusion of moral superiority. If as a result of rape, a man could become pregnant, I doubt whether any such proposal would be contemplated in this House. This proposal fails to treat women as people it treats them as a commodity. As my colleague, Deputy Barnes, said, it treats women as if they cannot be trusted. It is argued that if a raped woman becomes pregnant, the very fact of pregnancy diminishes the possibility of suicide. Finnish research has been cited, but I seriously question that research and this proposition. What research has been undertaken in this State to determine the number of rape victims who have committed suicide? How many women have sustained a pregnancy resulting from rape and in the months or years subsequent to the birth of their child committed suicide? No one knows the answer to that. One of the most extraordinary aspects of this proposal is the attitude of the Progressive Democrats. In 1992, Progressive Democrat Members of this House stood on their feet in a state of moral outrage to condemn the proposal put to the people in the 1992 referendum to exclude the possibility of a termination where there was a risk of self-destruction. We now have the Progressive Democrats in Government and a former Progressive Democrat Attorney General producing a proposal which simply replicates what occurred in 1992. The Attorney General's attitude to this is particularly astonishing and deserves some brief examination. It cannot be dealt with to the degree I would like to deal with it today. He states it is impossible to allow terminations to rape victims should they be suicidal or should they not be suicidal but simply rape victims, and he gives reasons. He states that if we did, it would allow any person below the legal age to have an abortion, but if a girl below the legal age is pregnant, it means she is the victim of statutory rape. Are we saying that 12 and 13 year olds who have been raped should not be allowed a termination? It seems we are, but even more astonishingly, the Attorney General claims that if we had to decide a woman was the victim of rape and we allowed a termination, that could jeopardise a fair trial of the person alleged to be the rapist. The Attorney General's logic is that a pregnant suicidal girl or woman who is the victim of rape should be prevented from a pregnancy termination because the alleged rapist, if a termination was allowed, might be denied a fair trial. That reasoning is not only unacceptable but extraordinary.;3242451

Following a woman conceiving as a result of rape, the central issue should not be whether the woman is suicidal. After suffering the trauma of being raped, it is for the pregnant victim with the help of counselling to determine whether to maintain her pregnancy. Having suffered such personal violation, only a barbaric society would deny to a rape victim the opportunity to terminate a pregnancy conceived through rape. If asked whether a woman who has been raped and is pregnant as a result of that rape should be allowed to terminate her pregnancy, the vast majority of people in this State would answer 'Yes'.;3242454

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;How many male Members of this House would deny to their wife, daughter or partner the possibility of a termination where their wife, daughter or partner had conceived as a consequence of rape? I do not believe many Members would go on public record to say that if their daughter was raped, they would compel her to maintain the pregnancy. Curiously, I have not heard any Members of the House who favour this legislation address that issue in these personal terms, despite the fact that this proposal seeks to ensure that within this State a rape victim should not be allowed the possibility of a termination, even if they are suicidal. It is 18 years since we addressed this issue in the first abortion referendum. I opposed that proposal at great political cost personally and I am opposed to this proposal. Instead of trying to deny the possibility of termination to suicidal rape victims, be they adult women or teenage girls, we should change our laws in a different direction. We should be mature enough to debate this issue and to allow the pregnant victims of incest or rape the right to a termination in this country where the pregnancy results from incest or rape. For the State to attempt, through constitutional measures, to deny the possibility of termination to a raped pregnant teenager or woman, it can truly be described as State abuse and, in relation to teenagers, State constituted child abuse. The Government presented this Bill as a means of addressing the concerns of the pro-life lobby. It ends the possibility of a suicidal raped teenager to effect a termination while it claims to be addressing the general concerns of women in providing for terminations in approved hospitals. However, it is worth looking at what the legislation provides. The legislation extends the possibility to a Minister of approving places that may conduct medical procedures to terminate pregnancies where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. However, it provides no guarantee that an order will ever be made by the Government or its successor to approve any [1123] hospital or clinic anywhere in the State to carry out any such terminations. What would the position be if this proposal was successful and this Government or its successor was dependent after the next election on the four Independents who warned that should any hospital or clinic be approved for the carrying out of terminations they will either not support the Government or bring the Government down? This legislation is a charade. It makes a pretence of addressing what is referred to as the substantive issue, to allow for the carrying out of terminations in this State where women's lives are truly at risk, but gives no guarantee that any hospital or clinic will ever be approved for the carrying out of such terminations. The Bill only guarantees to end the possibility of young women who are the victims of rape or young women who are pregnant and suicidal having those pregnancies terminated in this State. In that sense the Bill is a charade. There is another interesting question. If this Bill is enacted and approval is given for a hospital or clinic to carry out terminations, there is no measure in the Bill for that approval to be withdrawn. I share the views expressed by Deputy Barnes when she criticised the use of the term 'social abortions'. However, I raise the following proposition for those who wish to engage in that type of language. Should a hospital or clinic be approved, as is envisaged, for the carrying out of terminations, should the medical personnel in that hospital or clinic take a broad view of the circumstances in which terminations can be effected and should they effect what the Attorney General has referred to as social abortions, it is clear that, in the context of this measure being given a constitutional imprimatur in a referendum, there will be no mechanism available to Government to withdraw the approval previously given. For the above reasons and many others I do not have time to discuss, the Bill should be opposed. I wish to give the Government a warning. There is a suggestion that Committee Stage of this Bill may be taken by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Health and Children instead of on the floor of the House, but that should not happen. Committee Stage of the Bill should be debated on the floor of the House with all Deputies having an opportunity, under the glare of public monitoring, to participate in that debate and to tease out the fundamental and fatal flaws in the proposal.;3242456
1952;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;08.11.01;M;Mr. Noel O'Flynn;Fianna Fáil;I am pleased to support a Bill which will give the people of Ireland an opportunity to express their view on abortion. Political research over the past decade has consistently shown that the people stand by their decision in 1983 to provide for a constitutional ban on abortion. If anything, support has grown for that ban since 1983. A new generation of young voters, too young to vote in 1983, will go to the polls to [1124] express their support for a constitutional ban on abortion. The current debate was sparked by the extraordinary judgment in the so-called X case in 1992. It seems perverse to many people that a constitutional wording designed to protect equally the unborn child and its mother could have been interpreted in such a way that the mother could threaten to kill herself and, in effect, her unborn child and use this threat to demand an abortion. It is my opinion, which I express under Dáil privilege as a Member of the Legislature, that no reasonable person could conclude that the people of Ireland or the Oireachtas intended to create any abortion right in passing the eighth amendment in 1983. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court ruled in February 1992 that such an abortion right had been created. That was the court's privilege. It is now our privilege to give the people a chance to right this perceived wrong. When this amendment goes before the people, it will be their privilege to vote 'Yes' to it and I will join them in casting a 'Yes' vote. I have used the term 'abortion right'. Those two words lie at the centre of the decade of debate since 1992. Let us get to the heart of the matter. In our society, as in almost all societies, there is a group of people who actively campaign to introduce abortion on demand. That is the ultimate abortion right. The way in which these people and groups work is to start with a hard case and press for the introduction of a limited abortion right which they then campaign to extend. In Ireland, the tactics of the pro-abortion lobby have been to try, despite the eighth amendment in 1983, to get something, anything, defined as an abortion right. Their main approach has been to attempt to have defined as abortion the long-standing medical practice of intervening to deal with an illness that threatens the life of a pregnant woman, where the treatment has a high probability of causing the death of the child, who would probably die anyway if the mother was not treated. The main reason for the opposition of those who support abortion to this constitutional amendment is that if it is passed, procedures intended to save a woman's life, as opposed to killing an unborn child, would not be defined as abortion. Those who campaign for limited abortion use the phrase 'termination of pregnancy'. Pregnancy is the stage of human life between the fertilisation of a conceived human being in the womb and the birth of that human being. This constitutional amendment will prevent the intentional taking of human life during pregnancy. It is clearly and unambiguously anti-abortion. The twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution will continue the unambiguous right of a woman to life during pregnancy, a unique phase of life during which two human beings physically co-exist, each with an equal right to life. When a medical threat to one or both lives occurs, very difficult decisions have to be made. The threat [1125] must be addressed with the intention of saving both lives, but unfortunately one life may be lost. Very often the unborn child, the weaker of the two, will not make it through. The death of the child in such circumstances is a different moral situation, however, to the deliberate destruction of the child. As medical interventions during pregnancy are intended to save life and not to kill it, these interventions are not murder and cannot be referred to as abortion. This Bill intends to facilitate the practice of such medical interventions. Natural occurrences lead to the need for medical intervention. There can be no question of the bona fides of an intervention that is made in response to the diagnosis of a serious physical problem. In plain language, such a problem cannot be put on for the purpose of procuring a social abortion. Much has been said about the rare cases of ectopic pregnancy, where the fertilised egg does not reach the womb, rests in the fallopian tubes and develops there. Action has to be taken in such circumstances as the unborn child will not survive in the tubes and the mother may also die. The key point is that action should be taken to save life. The proposed amendment makes clear that intervention may happen in such cases without being seen to constitute abortion. There is no threat to the life of a woman in the twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution, but there is a ban on abortion when a woman threatens her own life. If constitutional law allowed it, it would be the easiest thing in the world for a woman to announce that she is suicidal and to threaten to commit suicide if she cannot have an abortion. The Medical Council has protected this country from the introduction of such social abortions. I regret that the council has been targeted recently by the pro-abortion lobby, which tried to overturn the council's long-standing guidelines in a ham-fisted manner. The Medical Council should not have to hold the front line against abortion as that is our job as legislators, as Members of the Oireachtas. We have been elected by the people, to whom we will have to answer next year. Those of us opposed to abortion have put the onus on the Medical Council. We have asked doctors to take the main stand. Those of us on the Government side have taken a courageous stand to tackle this issue as legislators in a democratic manner, as desired by the people. Great credit is due to the Taoiseach for his leadership on this issue. The Government has taken time to think carefully about this issue. Deputy Brian Lenihan has played a key role in the process and it has been shown beyond doubt that his recommendations reflect the will of the public for a referendum on life. Members of Fianna Fáil have seriously doubted the resolve of the party and the Government to tackle this problem. Suspicion had started to build up against politicians as a result of years of delay and debate, but I hope people now clearly see that we will not let them down. Particular tribute is due not only to the Taoiseach and Deputy Brian [1126] Lenihan, but also to Deputies from the Progressive Democrats Party, who have displayed decisiveness. Although it is seen as a liberal party, it has put the democratic wishes of the people above the personal views of individual members. Deputies from that party will be seen as greater statesmen and stateswomen as a result. Such decisive leadership in an election year contrasts with the behaviour of the Opposition. I give credit to the leader of the Labour Party for announcing a clear policy favouring abortion in certain circumstances, although I oppose it. The problem faced by Deputy Quinn is that his party's policy directly defies the democratic expression of opinion at its conference. Members of the Labour Party voted to make it party policy to support abortion on demand. It is clear to all that the Fine Gael Party is incapable of demonstrating leadership on any matter related to the liberal agenda, as there are two totally polarised viewpoints within the party. It is united only in its defunct policy of civil war politics on the North and by its anti-Fianna Fáil tendencies. At least two Fine Gael Members of the Oireachtas from Dublin have based their political careers directly on their promotion of a pro-abortion stance. At the other end of the country, Fine Gael Oireachtas Members are completely pro-life. The result is that Fine Gael is incapable of taking a stand as a united party.;3242457

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;13.11.01;M;Mr. John Browne;Fine Gael;(Carlow-Kilkenny): Previously, I outlined that Members on the Government side were debating this Bill as if it were a question of introducing or preventing abortion in Ireland. I have pointed out that this Bill is simply trying to patch up the botched wording that was inserted in the Constitution in 1983. Arising from the X case, that wording has led to the legalising of abortion for people who threaten to commit suicide. I do not know why we are discussing wording to be inserted into the Constitution that will in turn be challenged. Previously I mentioned that the challenge would be on whether it is conception or implantation. Members got a letter today from pro-life representatives questioning that. If this wording is inserted in the Constitution it will be challenged immediately. My forecast is – as happened in 1983 – that this will be challenged by one side, or both sides, on a couple of grounds and that more amendments will have to be brought forward later. If we had left the matter as it was in 1983 – when the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, made abortion illegal – we would not be in the mess we are in now, because abortion would be illegal. It is because we tried to copperfasten something that did not need it that we have got into these difficulties. It stems from inserting a wording in the Constitution that is not necessary. If the Government started from scratch again, we might save ourselves a great deal of bother and rows might be avoided, although this debate is more peaceful than in 1983 when the debate was savage at times. I cannot see what is to be achieved by introducing this legislation because the Minister went out of his way in his contribution to point out the question of the girl who was permitted to have an abortion by the Supreme Court because she was going to commit suicide and that a girl in a similar position would still be free to travel to England to have an abortion. Are we not playing with words? When people look back on this debate in 25 years they will say we were talking about preventing abortion while saying that women may still travel to England for an abortion. The problem is that 5,000 to 6,000 women travel to England for abortions annually and this debate will not have the slightest effect on that. People will say in 25 years that we were playing around with words and were fiddling like Nero while women travelled for abortions. We pretend we are doing something about this in the legislation. Words will be inserted in the Constitution which will be challenged in the Supreme Court. I received letters today stating that the word 'conception' should be inserted for 'implantation'. That is the first sign of a challenge and will result in a Supreme Court case. I do not know why the Government is bothering with this Bill. The Government gave a commitment four and a half years ago after the election so that it could stay in power.;3243229
1956;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;13.11.01;M;Mr. Seán Power;Fianna Fáil;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. I have listened to contributions on this Bill in recent weeks from Members on all sides of the House. We should not be surprised that there appears to be a difference of opinion as to how this matter should be dealt with. The issue of abortion has been the subject of much debate [1359] in Ireland and throughout the world. Regardless of the measures taken by Governments on this issue, there will not be consensus in any country. The Government cannot be held responsible for how other countries decide to address the matter of abortion. It is important when looking at this Bill to look at how this issue has been dealt with in the past so that we can understand how we have arrived at the situation in which we find ourselves today. The fact that past abortion referenda, including debates on the topic inside and outside this House, have been divisive does not mean that we should not deal with the matter today. Concerns have been expressed by Deputies who feel we should not proceed with a referendum as it may be bitter, but that is not a sufficient argument for the postponement of action on abortion. This House cannot take credit regarding this matter, given that it has taken a great length of time to deal with it. In 1992 the Supreme Court ruled that abortion is lawful if there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, including the threat of suicide, and the ruling has been with us since that year. While two of the three referenda held in 1992 to deal with the situation were successful, one was defeated. Abortion has been legal in this country since that time, although to the best of my knowledge no abortions have been carried out. It was important for the Government to respond to the Supreme Court decision. The Government has gone to great lengths to consult as widely as possible in an attempt to reach a consensus on the matter. It is obvious from the debate that has taken place in this House that such a consensus has not been reached and I do not think such a consensus will be enjoyed. Nevertheless, it is important that the Government proceeds along the lines that have been outlined. Regardless of the sides that have been taken in the abortion debate or when voting in previous referenda, most people agree that the situation that has prevailed since 1992 is unacceptable and requires action. While successive Governments have been reluctant to deal with the situation, great credit is due to the Taoiseach and his Cabinet for grasping the nettle. Abortion is not an easy subject to deal with as complex matters can arise. The Government has treated the issue in a mature fashion and I hope its efforts bear fruit. Before the Government came to office, the Taoiseach gave a commitment to deal with the issue of abortion. Shortly after he became Taoiseach, he announced that a Green Paper would be published on abortion, and that happened two years later. At all times the public and interested bodies were invited to participate and the consultation that took place was as wide as there has ever been on any matter. All submissions were given consideration before publication of the Green Paper and no individual or group should have felt ignored in the consultation process. Following its publication, the Government referred the Green Paper to the All-Party Com[1360] mittee on the Constitution for consideration. Like many other speakers, I pay tribute to all members of the committee for the long hours they put in to consider the Green Paper. The medical profession, representatives of various Churches and many experts in different areas were given the opportunity to state their cases and to explain how they would like to see the matter resolved. While the committee did not agree on the best way to proceed, every effort was made to appreciate and understand the huge complexities that surround the abortion issue. I listened to speakers this evening talking about turning back the clock to the situation before 1983. I am convinced that most Irish people consider themselves to be pro-life. While they are anxious to have a ban on abortion, they are also anxious to ensure that best medical practice is protected and that women in need of urgent medical care during pregnancy are allowed and afforded the necessary attention. The question of what the Government is trying to do has been asked. The purpose of the proposed constitutional amendment is to deal with the most unsatisfactory legal situation that has existed since the 1992 Supreme Court decision. While there is no such thing as perfect legislation, I am convinced that the formula presented by the Government is inspirational and I commend all those involved in its production. Many questions have been asked in the year since the all-party committee published its report and the Government announced its plan to deal with the abortion issue. The two most important questions, however, relate to what will happen if the proposal is carried and what will happen if it is defeated. If the Government is successful, it can be said with certainty that three things will happen. Maximum protection for the unborn will be ensured, the medical treatment required to protect the life of pregnant women will be provided and future change on this matter will only be made in a referendum. When the proposal becomes law, no future Government will be able to change it. If the proposal is defeated, abortion will become a reality in Ireland. It will be permitted for any woman who can prove a real or substantial threat to her life. The courts will have to decide who can or cannot have an abortion. I am not convinced that such a scenario is desired by the people. They would like to bring some clarity to a situation that has been clouded for almost 20 years. I thank the Government for its efforts in trying to bring some clarity to this matter. I accept that some people have genuine problems with the proposal. People should think seriously about the consequences of their vote in the referendum. It is ten years since the Government dealt with the matter. The opportunity being presented is as a result of a long process of consultation, deliberation and debate. I doubt such an opportunity will be presented again for a long time if the Government proposal is defeated next year. While I respect the duty and the right of all parties and individuals in the House to state their [1361] own case, it is a pity we do not have cross-party support on the issue. Perhaps some of the Opposition were caught offside by the Government's announcement of a referendum and as a result are reluctant to support the measure proposed by Government. The only opinion coming from the Labour Party seems to be from those who might consider themselves the liberal wing of the party and they imply that the proposal is crazy and off the wall. I am convinced that the vast majority of Irish people will support the proposal when it is put to them in a referendum next year. I am convinced too that many members of the Opposition support the Government's proposal but are reluctant to express that view in the House. It is unfortunate that politics and the prospect of a general election have been allowed to cloud people's judgment on the issue. That is unnecessary and brings a lack of clarity to the situation. We have dealt successfully with the issue of travel and information but the real or substantive issue of abortion has yet to be dealt with. People have been critical of the decision by the Government that the risk of suicide will not be acceptable grounds for an abortion. Any fair-minded person should accept that to allow a threat of suicide provide justification for aborting a child is not acceptable and cannot be tolerated. I am pleased the Government has decided to remove that. That is not to say, as Deputy Stagg suggested, that the Government does not trust the women of Ireland. Our duty is to legislate and provide leadership. It may seem hypocritical to bring in legislation preventing women from having abortion in this country and at the same time allow a situation where people can travel to Britain and have abortions, but it is not our duty to legislate for Britain. We have enough to do to provide the best legislation we can in the best interests of the country, and I do not apologise for supporting the Government in that. None of us had a say in our conception or birth, or the circumstances surrounding our birth. It is important that the unborn are protected and I am honoured to support the measure proposed by the Government. People have written and spoken about abortion in the case of rape. It is difficult for us to be critical of the actions of parents who find themselves with a young daughter in this terrible situation. I do not wish to pass judgment on parents who feel pressurised into taking a particular course of action in such a situation, but I would like to think that if I were in a similar situation I would give the same consideration to the unborn child as I would to my own. Irish women have travelled to Britain for abortions for many years. The Taoiseach mentioned that 18 Irish women a day have abortions in Britain. For every woman travelling to Britain, there is a father of a child so we are not just talking of 18 women but of 18 women and their partners. Unwanted pregnancies are obviously a huge problem. [1362] I welcome the establishment of the new Crisis Pregnancy Agency as announced by the Minister for Health and Children last month. The job of the agency is to draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and promote options other than abortion where a pregnancy occurs and to provide for post-abortion services. The Government will be providing £5 million next year to fund the new agency which has a very difficult job. It will have many clients desperately in need of help. Listening to the contributions of several Members this evening would lead one to believe that abortion answers all problems. While it might provide relief for some, studies show that in the long-term it can create more problems than it solves. Looking back as a nation we can only be ashamed of our treatment of young single women who became pregnant in years past. Pressure was brought to bear on them, forcing them to take the boat to England rather than cause embarrassment to their families at home. We all know of situations where young women who became pregnant were left with the choice of abortion or adoption. The shame families felt led to the alienation and isolation of their pregnant daughters who were put into hiding until after the birth of the child. I would like to think that there have been major changes in our attitudes and that we have become more tolerant. We must accept that many children born today are born out of wedlock, but that does not make them any less valuable than children born to married couples. We often refer to the vulnerable in our society. A country can be judged by how it looks after those who cannot look after themselves. The unborn are the most vulnerable group of all and I am proud and satisfied to support the Government proposal to protect the unborn. News of a pregnancy is usually greeted with much joy and expectation but for some it can be a terrible crisis. A teenager still at school or college, a young woman making a career for herself or an older woman concerned about her health and that of her baby might be forced to take the boat to England. I ask people not to be judgmental. We are all mature adults and responsible for our own actions but we should not be too critical of people with whose actions we might not agree.;3243230

I am amazed the legislation is before us because it has nothing to do with whether abortion is carried out in the State because abortion is still banned under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. This so-called effort to provide for abortion under the Constitution will be referred immediately to the Supreme Court for interpretation and what people vote for will make no difference. If the Supreme Court judges say the word 'black' means 'grey', that is it. They will interpret the legislation and I do not know what we are at.;3243234

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;13.11.01;F;Ms. Mildred Fox;Independent;I welcome the fact that we have reached this stage of the human life in pregnancy Bill and that this issue has been given so much attention by a Government. It is certainly not before time, coming nine years after the difficult X case left unfinished business in relation to the protection of the unborn. Abortion has been a taboo subject for too long, with successive Governments declaring when asked that it was a complex subject. While I acknowledge that it was not an easy subject to deal with, unfortunately, not much more progress was made. I was most surprised for this reason to see the subject appear in a Fianna Fáil election manifesto with a promise to hold a referendum in the lifetime of the Government. This was one of the factors which allowed me to discuss support for the Government. I acknowledge that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution had a huge workload to get through following publication of the Green Paper in 1999. The committee held hearings and, in general, facilitated a full and fair public consultation process involving a wide range of groups holding an even wider range of views on this subject. Despite criticism from me regarding the time it was taking to make recommendations, I compliment the all-party committee on the work it did [1348] at that time, regardless of the individual opinions of committee members on the subject. I welcome this proposal which tackles head on, through a number of means, issues that have proven difficult in the past. It will enable three very important goals to be achieved, protection of the unborn, protection of current medical practice and consulting the people. Achieving balance in the attainment of these three goals is not simple and that is why the proposal to couple legislation with a referendum is the only realistic way to deal with the issue. There are very real fears that if this issue remains in limbo the Supreme Court decisions somehow will become the thin end of the wedge. In general, it is felt that both judgments require a response in constitutional or legislative terms. The history of how we got to where we are today is long and difficult. I hope the lessons of the past have been learned. The fact that no laws were enacted following the passing of the 1983 referendum left the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, as the basic law in this area. Following the Supreme Court's decision in the X case in 1992 where it was found that if there was a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct to the health of the mother and if this could only be averted by a termination such a termination would be legal, we had a situation which was contrary to the intended effect of the 1983 amendment and which went against the wishes of those who voted for the pro-life amendment in 1983. Abortion, albeit in limited but hard to define circumstances, was now legal in the country that had voted nine years previously to reject it. The C case in 1997 further underpinned the risk of suicide as a reason for termination. The question of suicide, which will no doubt feature as an issue in the forthcoming referendum, whenever it takes place, deserves to be debated. While the decision of the Supreme Court in relation to suicide may have been deemed to be correct in that particular case, I do not believe that the laws for the population of a country should be made on the basis of an individual case. The simple expression, 'hard case makes bad law', applies to this issue. Attention was paid in the 1999 Green Paper to suicide and a submission by the pro-life campaign highlighted surveys carried out on suicide in Norway where, unlike in Ireland, comprehensive studies have been carried out. It was found that pregnant women were among the lowest risk group to commit suicide and that women who have previously had an abortion were among the high risk group. One issue that caused great disquiet following the 1983 referendum was the unclear status of the mother. Her rights to life were not clearly safeguarded and it became obvious that this could cause major ethical problems for the medical profession. Section 1 addresses for the first time the role which the medical profession plays. It states: 'Abortion does not include the carrying out of a [1349] medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self destruction.' I support this principle 100%. The section clearly protects medical practitioners in the carrying out of necessary medical procedures on pregnant women. It cannot be considered a criminal offence to treat a pregnant woman with necessary medical practices, even if that procedure results in the death of an unborn child as a result. I acknowledge that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world to have a baby, thanks to our medical professionals, and it is only right and just that their position should be safeguarded after all this time. Aside from protecting the medical profession, the section also has the effect of attempting to clarify the definition of abortion. It makes the distinction between medical practice and abortion, a matter which has been ambiguous and confusing for too long. When the Minister for Health and Children introduced the Bill on 25 October he acknowledged the 6,500 women who travelled abroad to have abortions over the past 12 months. A magic wand cannot be waved to prevent this from happening. The argument that has been put forward in some quarters that it is time all of us in the pro-life campaign grew up acknowledged that many Irish women are travelling abroad to have abortions and that introduced abortion as a result is ridiculous. A number of Irish women have had abortions abroad and a number of women will travel abroad to have abortions following the introduction of this Bill. While we can do nothing about that fact, we still have control over this jurisdiction and we should still have a say in how our country is shaped. It is up to us to decide whether it is acceptable to legalise abortion or to criminalise it regardless of what the laws are in the UK. Likewise it is up to us to decide to criminalise drug use, unlike another neighbour, Holland. The fact that so many women travel abroad must be tackled in a humane and non-judgmental way. I am sure the decision to have an abortion must be a very difficult decision to make and is not made lightly. For that reason I very much welcome the introduction of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to examine the situation and formulate a compassionate and realistic strategy to deal with crisis pregnancies. I know that this recommendation was made by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and I understand that Ms Olive Braiden has been appointed to the chair of this committee. Her appointment, coupled with funding of 6. 5 million for 2002, gives me great confidence that a meaningful strategy to tackle crisis pregnancy will be formulated. Much has been made in the media of statements made from time to time by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney who has stated on a number of [1350] occasions that she does not want a divisive and bitter referendum. I certainly share that view and I would ask that all sides in the forthcoming referendum participate in a measured, calm debate dealing with the facts. The media have a large role to play in this regard and as a pro-life person, I hope it is not only the negative issues that are highlighted in the course of the campaign. On an issue which has been raised by Deputy Browne, certain elements of the pro-life movement have been concerned about the whole question of conception versus implantation. A number of people have written to me who are genuinely concerned about this matter. A recent article in the Irish Catholic newspaper attempted to address and clarify this issue. It said that there has been no attempt in the Bill to define when human life begins. The protection offered to an embryo between conception and implantation is not weakened in any way by this proposal. Article 40. 3.3º prevented Ireland from signing the recent Council of Europe's convention on bio-ethics because it allowed for human embryo experimentation. As I said, the protection for the embryo between conception and implantation will not be weakened in any way by this proposal. I see this as the last chance to provide meaningful protection to the unborn. There is no other formula on offer. Adopting impossible positions will not achieve any means to forward the protection of the unborn. All it will succeed in doing is paralysing any chance of mainstreaming the pro-life issue. This proposal is a balanced and fair proposal worthy of support. It safeguards the life of the mother, medical practice and unborn children. It puts the decision-making process back into the hands of the people and it is now up to the people to decide on the future of Ireland's unborn.;3243237
1964;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;13.11.01;M;Mr. Emmet Stagg;The Labour Party;I sincerely hope the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is defeated in the House. The Bill is flawed and the philosophy behind it is anti-woman. If passed, it will serve only to plunge this country into yet another bitter, divisive abortion referendum, the only goal of which is to pander to the most right-wing groups in society. In the past two decades, these groups have opposed the introduction of divorce, the introduction of sex education in schools, the introduction and widespread availability of contraception, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the constitutional referenda in 1992 on the right to information and the right to travel. They are also the groups whose fanatical pursuit of a constitutional prohibition on abortion has created the constitutional and legal mess that has pertained in this country since 1983. It appears these groups, which have been proved wrong on every question of sexual, marital or reproductive reform for more than 30 years, now have the ear of the Taoiseach. He will dance to their tune and foist an unwanted referendum on this country during the spring. The tragedy of the Government's proposal is that it will do absolutely nothing to reduce the rate of Irish abortions. We have an abortion rate in Ireland. Today at least 18 Irish woman will tra[1354] vel to England to terminate a pregnancy. Figures indicate that approximately 11% – one of the highest rates in Europe – of all pregnancies in the State result in termination. Every year the number of Irish women travelling to England has steadily increased. At one of the most stressful times in their lives these women, and girls, are effectively exiled from this country. Their citizenship is temporarily suspended. They are told that official Ireland does not want to know. Officially, Ireland is a shining light of protection for the unborn. Officially, we have no abortions in this country and, officially, we will have a referendum that will even prevent women who are suicidal during a pregnancy from having an abortion here. During this time, on a daily basis, Irish women, struggling with the complexities, doubts and dangers of a pregnancy, choose to go to England for an abortion. The sole purpose of the Bill is to roll back the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case. The X case conferred a legal right to an abortion in this State for the very rare number of women who are suicidal during pregnancy. During the past decade, only two such cases have come to public attention, the X case and the C case. Both cases involved young girls who were raped by men and who were in such a state of mental and physical turmoil that they were suicidal during pregnancy. The Taoiseach now believes the whole country must vote to prevent young women such as Ms X and Ms C seeking an abortion in Ireland. To justify this nonsense the Taoiseach has raised the spectre of the X case judgment being used to introduce what he has decided to term 'social abortion'. In his speech on 2 October last, at the launch of the Bill, the Taoiseach stated: I think that to legislate for the decision in the X case, and, in particular, to make complex legal provision and control for the suicide risk as a ground for abortion, would commence an inevitable slide to freely available ‘social abortion' in Ireland. I do not know what the term 'social abortion' means. I know of young Irish women who, during a crisis pregnancy, chose not to bring the pregnancy to full term and travelled to England for an abortion. In each and every case these women thought deeply and profoundly about the choices before them. Not one of the abortions could be termed a social abortion. Each and every decision is a profoundly personal one that no Irish woman has taken easily. The Taoiseach's comments at his press conference were extremely revealing. He believes that legislating for the X case would lead to 'an inevitable slide to freely available ‘social abortion.'' What the Taoiseach is really saying is that we cannot trust Irish women. He suggests that if we were to legislate for the very narrow grounds on which Irish women could obtain an abortion in the State, such as the grounds elucidated in the X case, it would not stop there. The Taoiseach's rationale for the referendum was [1355] even more clearly spelt out by his party colleague, Deputy O'Flynn. During his contribution last week, Deputy O'Flynn revealed the real thinking behind the Taoiseach's comments at the press launch. The Deputy declared: There is no threat to the life of a woman in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution, but there is a ban on abortion when a woman threatens her own life. If constitutional law allowed it, it would be the easiest thing in the world for a woman to announce that she is suicidal and to threaten to commit suicide if she cannot have an abortion. There it is in a nutshell. The Government believes we must have a referendum because Irish women cannot be trusted. If one legislated for the X case, within days the mendacious mná na hÉireann would be casually declaring that they were suicidal or threatening to commit suicide just to obtain an abortion. The Government will not legislate for the X case because the women of Ireland, or at least those of a child bearing age, cannot be trusted. That is what Deputy O'Flynn said in the House last week and that is what the Taoiseach meant at his press conference. Deputy O'Flynn went on to say that the X case was 'based ultimately on what a woman in a distressed state of mind was prepared to threaten to get her own way on abortion . . . The purpose of the Twenty-fifth Amendment is to put a stop to that route to abortion. There is no secret about this.' The premise on which this referendum is based could not be clearer. The women of Ireland cannot be trusted. To legislate for the X case would result in freely available abortion in this country because women would distort the truth and lie, even about an issue like suicide, just to get their own way on abortion, as Deputy O'Flynn told us. Shame on the Taoiseach, shame on Deputy O'Flynn and shame on Fianna Fáil. That the Progressive Democrats are willing to support misogynist nonsense like this beggars belief. That they are willing to support an amendment to our Constitution which denigrates and belittles Irish women is shocking. Is their love of power and perks such that the Minister and Minister of State, Deputies Harney and O'Donnell, are willing to turn a blind eye to the most anti-woman piece of legislation brought before this House in decades? I remind these two Deputies, in particular, of the clarion call to be either 'radical or redundant' issued by the current Attorney General. We now know the answer. As far as the principles of liberalism are concerned, the Progressive Democrats are redundant. Shame on Deputies Harney and O'Donnell. The Taoiseach's reasoning for this Bill and the proposed referendum is repugnant to women in this country. If passed, we will continue to export to Britain and other European countries those Irish women who seek an abortion. Not one abortion will be prevented because of this refer[1356] endum. This referendum will result in an important right being taken away from Irish women. This right, which states that Irish women who are suicidal during a pregnancy can have an abortion in this country, is rarely used. It applies to only a very small number of Irish women but it is an important and humane right. Now that right is to be taken away. Now we are telling Irish girls and women that if they are pregnant and if the prospect of carrying the pregnancy to full term is such that they are contemplating suicide, we will force them to get on a plane, go to a lonely English city and have their pregnancy terminated there. We are telling them not to expect any sympathy or assistance from the Irish State. We are saying 'we will temporarily send you into exile, forget officially that you exist and maintain our utterly useless moral superiority in saying that Ireland is abortion-free'. That empty, misleading formula seems to be more important than the real life trauma and heartache that some Irish women will undoubtedly face in the years to come. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. With his now customary use of weasel words, the Taoiseach has called for public debate on this issue to be informed by a 'spirit of reason, tolerance and open-mindedness'. The Taoiseach's naivety is hardly convincing. Like many in this House, he has seen at first hand the emotions raised before in previous abortion referenda. Last July, Emily O'Reilly, an experienced commentator on these issues, stated that 'an abortion referendum, almost by definition, would be bitter and divisive'. She is right and the Taoiseach knows it. He has lit the fuse on a divisive debate and has attempted to walk away. It is the height of political cowardice. If the Taoiseach wants proof of the type of debate we will soon have to endure, he need look no further than the contribution of his own Deputies to this debate. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, wasted no time in using the serious issue of schizophrenia to throw a cheap jibe across the floor of the House. Deputy Roche was hardly on his feet before using the words, 'nonsensical, illogical, extraordinary and hysterical' in reference to Deputy Owen's speech. Not to be outdone, Deputy O'Flynn declared that 'we should show support for women's rights by helping to pursue rapists, but we cannot do so by killing innocent children'. If the Taoiseach cannot even manage to get his own backbenchers to adhere to his call for reason, tolerance and open-mindedness, what hope is there during a referendum campaign?;3243238
1965;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;13.11.01;M;Mr. Dan Neville;Fine Gael;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. In particular I want to deal with suicide in the context of the Bill. I am president and director of the Irish Association of Suicidology, but the views I express are not those of the association, though I have discussed it with many members of the association by way of informing myself. Without doubt suicide is a terrible act against human nature. It creates terrible difficulties and trauma for family, community and friends. The level of suicide is unacceptable and we urgently need suicide prevention programmes. Suicide was part of the hidden Ireland. Less than ten years ago it was the responsibility of the Department of Justice as it was a crime the Department of Health had no involvement. It was taboo and the stigma surrounding it ensured it was not debated or discussed. The first discussions which took place in the Houses were tentative and people were very frightened of discussing it as they did not understand it and because of the implications it has in terms of thinking about people taking their own lives. While we have made much progress since the publication of the report of the national task force on suicide, we have a long way to go. Last year, 413 people died by suicide, while 415 died in road accidents. There is agreement that suicides are under-recorded, though not by much, so it is fair to say more died by suicide last year than in road accidents. In response to recent parliamentary questions the Minister informed me that £1. 2 million was spent last year on suicide prevention and research. If one does not count Garda costs, £21. 174 million was spent on road accidents, and rightly so – it was probably not [1369] enough – almost 20 times the amount spent on preventing suicide. The issues concerning suicide and pregnancy have been simplified. It is an extremely complex issue. There are women who are pregnant and suicidal who can be shepherded through their pregnancies and who after the births can fully recover and lead full lives. There are others who are depressed or suffering from suicidal ideation before becoming pregnant, through the pregnancy and after the pregnancy due to mental illness. It is also recognised that there are a few women who are deeply traumatised during pregnancy who are suicidal and are likely to take their own lives. The Government rightly says a pregnant woman in danger of death because of a physical injury must have her life protected. Does it not discriminate against those who are mentally ill to say a woman in serious danger of death because of her mental illness cannot be protected in the same way? It is discriminatory to say a woman who is seriously suicidal and who is suffering from a serious mental health condition cannot be protected in terms of terminating her pregnancy while this can be done where a woman is in real danger of death due to a physical illness. It will be said that those who have mental illness or are suicidal may not recover from their condition if the pregnancy is terminated, and that is so, but a person who is physically ill may not recover if she receives treatment which terminates the pregnancy. For example, a person with cancer whose treatment results in terminating the pregnancy may not recover. Cuireadh an díospóireacht ar athló. Debate adjourned.;3243239
1966;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le Linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;13.11.01;F;Ms. Frances Fitzgerald;Fine Gael;Abortion has been an emotive, difficult and divisive issue in this country over many years. Here we are again faced with a constitutional referendum on an issue that almost nowhere else in the world is dealt with by way of the Constitution. We must surely ask what is so different about Irish women and their pregnancies that they must be dealt with by way of the Constitution. The Government, the Taoiseach and the Ministers, in presenting this legislation, have told us that these proposals are reasonable and middle ground. Are they reasonable? Are they middle [1363] ground? The Ministers insist that the proposals represent a fair, reasonable and compassionate approach. They protest too much. The basic assumptions in the presentations of the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, are that they are taking a fair, reasonable and compassionate approach, but this is a flawed belief. It is interesting that the Government is seeking to have the Bill discussed in committee rather than on the floor of the House where it can be examined and put under further scrutiny. That would be the right thing to do and we owe it to the people to scrutinise this Bill very carefully and to present to the people the choice which the Government is offering. By all means let us have a debate which is measured, mature and thoughtful, but let that not be a cover for accepting unreasonable, anti-woman, insensitive, unethical, hypocritical and politically-driven proposals. These proposals come before us because the Taoiseach made a commitment in the course of a campaign, although it was not in the programme for Government, and now finds himself under pressure from four Independent Deputies and from lobby groups which have put this and previous Governments under pressure on this issue. By 2010, if not sooner, this legislation will be seen as a time-warped reflection on society and social policy, as Government hypocrisy. It is utterly extraordinary on the one hand to talk of excluding suicide and of criminalising a desperate woman and threatening her with 12 years imprisonment if she attempts to have an abortion while on the other hand to protest loudly that the Government will in no way deter such a woman from going to England for an abortion. The Taoiseach did so at his press conference, the Minister has done so in the House and the Bill does so on page 3. On the one hand the legislation denies that 7,000 Irish women have abortions in England every year. We have seen the statistics recently which show that the number is increasing. The denial of this fact looms over the legislation which criminalises the women involved and excludes suicidal women from having a procedure to save their lives. That is extraordinary. Of course, laws alone cannot deal adequately with the tragic realities of crisis pregnancies but surely our Constitution does not have to be used in this extraordinary way. Combining a law and a constitutional change into a single instrument reduces the constitutional powers and obligations of Members of this House. Our Constitution is not the right place to deal with this sensitive and difficult personal crisis for women. If we wanted to help women in this crisis we would not criminalise them in the Constitution. We would not write the kind of measures proposed here into the Constitution. We would be dealing with this issue by way of legislation. Why are we putting the morning after pill into the fundamental law of our written Constitution? Why should a new method [1364] of incorporating a law into the Constitution be used on this occasion and on this issue when the crisis for the woman concerned will not be averted in any way by this measure? This is an extraordinary and bizarre way to meddle with the Constitution, which has stood us in good stead, and it does not address the issue. The format proposed to deal with the issue of abortion could be called an emergency and exceptional one. If we were serious about dealing with the issue we would handle it in a totally different way. The tone of the Minister's speech seems to envisage hordes of women rushing for abortions like lemmings over a cliff, if the legislation is not passed. The Government appears to assume that this Bill and the medical profession are the only constraints on Irish women using abortion. Are we saying that a constitutional amendment is critical in stopping thousands more Irish women seeking an abortion or that it is the instrument which will protect the country? What about Irish women's good judgment and their demonstrated commitment to parenting and mothering over generations? Deputy Stagg spoke very well about the assumption that Irish women cannot be trusted and that a constitutional amendment is necessary to stop this extraordinary move that Irish women will make in relation to their pregnancies. There is a lack of basic trust about how Irish women handle pregnancy. The endless references to social abortion are an example of intellectual acrobatics. These statements tell us much about the speakers' views of the hundreds of thousands of women who have already gone to England for abortions. Deputy Mitchell has referred to the isolation of these women. Isolation has affected not only the women concerned but often their families and their partners. Now it is proposed to amend the Constitution and to criminalise them to an extraordinary degree. It is almost as if such Irish women are seen to act with inferior social motives and do not have good enough reasons to do what they do. The proposal is a commentary on these women who are not willing to become physical and mental wrecks. It is almost as if we question their qualification as Irish women. Are they only good enough to be dumped somewhere else? We are concerned with the effects of Sellafield but this is tantamount to us asking England to take our women in these difficult situations, women that we do not want to talk about or deal with in any comprehensive way. What is the assumption about the UK and its medical services and how we intend to use them, now and in the future? The references to freedom to travel appear to suggest that it is the opinion of the Government that English based doctors and nurses are capable of acts which in this proposal are close to homicide and which, if undertaken here, will attract equivalent sanctions. Yet, we are happy to allow women to travel to England. The Bill is tainted with a fundamentalism which locks women's reproductive rights into a [1365] constitutional framework in an extraordinary way. It amounts to a form of foetal protectionism which fails to find a middle ground of accommodating the rights of pregnant women to be treated with due regard. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, put it very well when, in a speech in 1995 on reproductive rights, she referred to the hard won rights of Irish women. It is disappointing to note the different tone she is adopting now but I recommend that people read the speech she made then. Am I to understand as a woman, mother and Deputy that the only things standing in the way of Irish women descending into this unstoppable morass of abortion seeking behaviour are the medical profession and this proposed amendment? I do not apologise for repeating what has been said, that the tone of the amendment is patriarchal and misogynist in its entirety. It implies that women who travel to England are extraordinary, that they do not really belong here and that they are not Irish. Indeed, there is almost a denial of the reality of their existence, apart from the reference to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which must be welcomed. I hope we will be able to discuss in greater detail the statutory instrument to establish it. Why are the hands of the Oireachtas being tied in terms of helping these women from a legislative point of view, now or in the future? Why is the Constitution being perverted to deal with this issue? It is an abandonment of democracy in an attempt to pander to a lobby group. It also amounts to a control of women's reproductive rights. The choice being presented is false and flawed. A number of Deputies, especially in the Fianna Fáil Party, have said the choice is between accepting this referendum or abortion on demand. That is a false presentation of the facts. There is no evidence that abortion on demand is wanted in this country and it is clear that Irish women should be medically protected where there is a threat to their life as a result of a pregnancy. Any right minded person would agree with that. Such protection should have legal sanction and we should give obstetricians the protection of the law for the difficult decisions that must occasionally be made in the course of pregnancy. It is equally clear that the morning after pill and contraceptives currently available should be legalised but it is absurd to do this through the Constitution. Key questions arise regarding the constitutional mechanism, including the way Ireland should be governed. It tips the balance away from the Legislature. Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to the changes involving the President and these are addressed in the Fine Gael amendment. This, and the changes involving the Supreme Court and the ministerial orders which can vary the effects of a constitutional provision raise fundamental questions about the balance of power and the role of the Constitution. [1366] There has been much talk about the extent of the consultation that took place when drafting the legislation but the fact that there was wide consultation does not mean that a right solution will be found. I pay great tribute to the work done by the All Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the way the consultation process took place. It was excellent and we should use it again as a future model. However, the process illustrated that there were differences of opinion on how to proceed. For example, Dr. Whitaker and his distinguished colleagues said that legislation was the only way forward to deal with the issue of suicide. Ultimately, this issue involves leadership and a Government decision on taking the best way forward. It is about Government and governance. The Government has not chosen the best way forward, indeed there is an abandonment of Government in the attempt to once again take the constitutional route. The people expressed their opinion in 1992 by voting yes to travel, yes to information and no to the substantive issue. In terms of the history of the Constitution the mechanism is wrong. Putting detailed legislative provisions of this kind into the Constitution has huge implications for human rights. Section 2(3) refers to aiding, abetting and counselling. It seeks to criminalise actions in areas of communication that fall short of abortion and has the potential to open up huge areas of constitutional challenge on the nature of freedom of expression. The Minister must address this aspect. The legislation treats women as if they were infantile in their behaviour. It suggests that they are irresponsible and immature and need constitutional safeguards to stop them otherwise committing serious and dangerous acts. I am convinced the Government takes the view that women are almost incapable of making moral decisions. The eighth amendment of the Constitution, dealing with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, will no longer be vindicated since it is proposed that suicidal women will no longer be protected. The legislation proposes that women will attract less protective worth, which is a serious problem. It must be asked, therefore, if the proposal is reasonable and does it find middle ground. Would a reasonable man or woman consider it appropriate? Let me consider the approach in the rest of the EU. Ireland will be the only country that will prohibit abortion in its Constitution. Apart from the UK, Ireland will be the only country that will not allow suicide as grounds for an abortion and, apart from the UK, it will be the only country that does not allow the cases of young girls who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest as grounds for abortion. Is the rest of the EU unreasonable? Is it reasonable to remove suicide entirely? Surely a middle ground approach would have been to define mechanisms for the assessment of suicide very carefully. Would the middle ground not leave this issue to the Oireachtas and [1367] the legislators, who are elected to enact laws? What would a reasonable mother or father occupying the middle ground want for their 14 year old child, a daughter who is pregnant as result of rape? Surely, at the least they would want to be free to consider a variety of options for her future in this country? Rape giving rise to pregnancy is a major crisis for the woman involved. The Government's seven point reply cites issues of consent and prosecution. They are almost arguments against rape as an indictable offence, not against it as a ground for abortion. The Government's reply to the question of incest and pregnancy is tantamount to asking a reasonable man or woman to go along with an incestuous pregnancy. Is there such a thing as a middle ground on incest and a resulting pregnancy? This is a very difficult issue but is a constitutional reply a middle ground response? The Government's middle ground is to pretend it does not happen and to constitutionally say that we will never consider dealing sympathetically through our laws with a young woman who has been raped. Is that reasonable? For many years the Church prescribed sexual and moral behaviour for women. Why should the State take on this role at a time when separation of Church and State is a given and when religious belief is a ground for non-discrimination in our equality laws? Why should the Government seek to endow one view of the protection of human life with a constitutional lock? As institutional religion recedes among some strata of the population, why should the State advance itself as the new protector, making a charge of the light brigade through our Constitution? Would a reasonable woman who could be potentially pregnant or her partner be worried by this legislation? They would because unexpectedly their planned and wanted pregnancy could become a health and life threatening condition for the woman, and the Constitution would not protect the family. Such a woman has every right to be worried under this Bill. There is no certainty the UK will forever permit abortions to be carried out on Irish women who travel to the UK. This area needs further discussion but I do not have time to go into it now. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, talked about being sincere, genuine and honest. Women know more than most that many laws have been passed which were honest, sincere and wrong, and this is another of them. It is Pontius Pilate legislation which washes our hands of women, of care and of counselling. It washes our hands of the X and C cases. The proposal is neither reasonable nor middle ground, but injurious and insensitive. It reduces women's rights. It is democracy taking a hit. The Dáil remains the bulwark of democracy, even if good times have caused citizens to take it for granted. There has been consultation the Government has asked the [1368] audience, telephoned a friend and opted for 50:50 as a middle ground. Many people have been asked but the solution is not good enough and I regret that the protective spirit in the Title of the Bill is not directed at women. The Government that expects 60% of women to take up paid employment under the national employment action plan, often without child care, at the same time expects them to accept legislation over their ova in the Constitution. This law infantilises women, who were treated as minors by the Catholic Church in the past. It will not stop one woman from having an abortion in England. It denies the reality of the problem here and expects another country to deal with our social problems. It builds in a constitutional level of denial which is dangerous and frightening. The Constitution will be aesthetically perfect in forbidding abortion, but pity the women whose decisions will spoil this purist picture and who by their reality will be treated as repugnant to the Constitution. I hope that if this is put to the people they will reject it. I hope the people will get every opportunity in the next few weeks and months to hear in detail and understand the legislation, and I hope we can debate it on Committee Stage in the Dáil.;3243240

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;13.11.01;M;Mr. Emmet Stagg;The Labour Party;The great tragedy is that the tens of thousands of Irish women who have had abortions in recent years will have to listen to this kind of nonsense. They will have to listen to fanatics on the pro-life side echoing Deputy O'Flynn's remarks about killing innocent children or worse. [1357] These women will have to endure this barrage of abuse in every newspaper and on every radio and television programme and for what? What purpose will this referendum serve? Its only purpose is to roll back the X case decision. Its only purpose is to force women who are suicidal – the two cases we know of involved 12 and 13 year old girls – to go to England to terminate their pregnancies. Is there any other State in the developed world which would insist on exiling people who are contemplating suicide? Is there any other State that, when confronted with the prospect of a citizen committing suicide, would decide to banish that person from its territory? That is what this referendum proposes and it is wrong. The introduction of this measure is disgraceful and I firmly believe the proposal will not win the support of the majority of Irish people. This country has matured and developed significantly in recent years. Approximately 100,000 Irish women have had an abortion since the 1983 amendment to Article 40. 3.3º. These are not cold statistics. They are the real life experiences of our daughters, sisters, grand-daughters, wives and partners. Abortion is a reality in Ireland. Abortion will remain a reality in Ireland, irrespective of what happens this ludicrous constitutional amendment. We do not have a debate on abortion in Ireland, we have a debate on geography. What seems to matter to the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party, the pro-life movement and the Progressive Democrats is not whether abortions occur but where they occur. To this end, thousands of women every year are sent abroad so that the myth that Ireland is abortion-free can be maintained. This referendum is another attempt to shore up that meaningless myth. If women have to borrow from money lenders to fund a trip to England, so be it. If women have to place their health at risk by having late abortions, so be it. If women have to engage in stories of a weekend away in London to maintain their privacy, so be it. Day in, day out, year in, year out, women have had to pay the price for our self-delusion on abortion. Irish women have suffered. Irish women have been plunged into debt. Irish women, at one of the most traumatic and difficult times of their lives, have been abandoned and exiled by this State. This happens so that we can pretend there is no abortion in Ireland it happens so that we can maintain the big myth, the big lie. This is dishonest and dangerous. This Government now wants to make the situation worse. It wants to drag us back to 1983. Its proposals criminalise pregnant women and those who assist them in seeking a termination in this country. In conclusion, I restate my total opposition to this Bill and the referendum it proposes. The legislative process by which the Government intends to pass this referendum is nothing more than constitutional vandalism. Regardless of a person's views on the issue, this proposal should be rejected out of hand for the bizarre and unpre[1358] cedented manner in which it intends to amend the Constitution. Most dangerous of all, we are writing into the Constitution, and protecting from amendment, detailed legislation which affects the life and health of women. It will take another referendum to amend this legislation. I ask the Minister, in replying to this debate, to outline what will happen to a pregnant woman who is suicidal and cannot, for whatever reason, leave the State? This scenario was raised by Deputy O'Malley during the debate in this House on 21 October 1992 on the substantive issue at that time. The Progressive Democrats may have conveniently brushed such concerns under the carpet now, but the question is as valid today as it was then. There is no doubt the terms of this legislation will tell a suicidal woman, who cannot leave the State, to continue with the pregnancy. The consequences of that approach are clear to everyone in the House. For that reason alone, this Bill should be rejected by the House, as the referendum proposing such lunacy will doubtless be rejected by the people. This referendum is unwarranted and unwanted. It is based on the principle that women cannot be trusted, that we cannot legislate for the X case because Irish women are devious liars and would use every trick in the book to qualify under the X case test. That is the simple truth of what is presented to us. That is the principle we will be asked to write into the Constitution and that is the principle the Progressive Democrats now appear to support. The referendum will ignore the experience of Irish women over the past 17 years. It will do nothing to reduce the number of abortions and will serve only to further alienate and marginalise the tens of thousands of Irish women who have opted to terminate a pregnancy since the original 1983 amendment. Ultimately, this legislation may dictate that a pregnant woman who is suicidal and cannot travel must bring the pregnancy to full term. The only other option open to that woman need not be spelt out as it is clear to everyone. This is appalling legislation. We do not need a referendum to roll back the X case decision. We should have the humanity and courage to legislate for women in a similar situation to the girl in the X case. The proposed constitutional amendment is dangerous in the extreme as it takes a right from Irish women when they are at their most vulnerable. It criminalises pregnant Irish women and is based on the principle that Irish women cannot be trusted. It does not deserve the support of this House.;3243242

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;13.11.01;M;Mr. John Anthony Moloney;Fianna Fáil;I thank Deputy Fox for allowing me to share her time. I welcome the proposal for a number of reasons. It deals effectively with the issue and unlike previous debates on abortion, we are starting at a point where people are reconciled to listening to the other point of view. Clearly the effect of the submissions to the Oireachtas committee has brought forward various strands of opinion and these have been effectively dealt with in the proposals. In the last general election, Fianna Fáil gave a clear commitment of support to a referendum. I am satisfied that we are now honouring those commitments. I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Cabinet for bringing this Bill before the House. It is the result of a good deal of research, debate, thought and deliberation over recent years. The object of the 25th amendment to the Constitution is to resolve the very unsatisfactory legal situation regarding abortion which has existed since the Supreme Court decision in the X case of 1992, and to resolve it in a way that gives the people of Ireland a direct say in doing so. This [1351] was our stated position in the 1997 general election campaign. When the Government came to office in 1997 it gave that clear commitment. I recognise the honourable role played by the Taoiseach in this fundamentally important issue. We made a promise to the people at the last election that there would be a referendum on this issue. The Taoiseach and the Government have been working towards honouring that promise since 1997. When the Government took office in 1997, the Taoiseach immediately set up a Cabinet committee to prepare the Green Paper on the subject of abortion. This committee, chaired by the Minister for Health and Children, oversaw the work of an interdepartmental group of officials who carried out the preparatory work. The Bill represents an honest attempt to finalise a debate and campaign which has dragged on for many years and it comes before the House following a careful and inclusive process of consultation and public debate. I hope that over the next few months the process of public debate, without the heat of previous debates, can continue and that the justifiable concerns of people can be dealt with. I met some people in the pro-life group in the past few weeks and they clearly felt that politicians had not been dealing adequately with the issue. They are now saying that they are satisfied with the proposal. It represents a careful and inclusive process of consultation. The preparation of the Green Paper included the invitation of submissions from interested parties and organisations on the issues under consideration. When the Green Paper was published it was referred by the Government to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution for consideration. I am very pleased the committee then embarked on a detailed process. Speaking to people who made submissions, they said that the consultative process was very helpful in examining the complex legal, medical and social issues involved. The difficulty in past referenda was that people felt the legal issues were too complex to grasp. Recognition has been given to concerns in that regard and it has been explained in layman's language. The outcome of the aforementioned deliberations has led the Government to conclude that there is no simple sentence or paragraph which can be inserted into the Constitution which by itself would amount to a balanced, effective and legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy. The Government sees that the proper place to strike the complex balance is in legislation, not in the Constitution. These proposals are the first legislative response to the issues raised by the 1983 amendment and by the X case. I am pleased the Government has decided to put an amendment to the people which will add two new subsections, 40. 3.4º and 40. 3.5º to article [1352] 40. 3 of the Constitution. Article 40. 3.4º proposes that the life of the unborn in the womb will be protected in accordance with the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2001. The exact provisions of this proposed Act will be published with the wording of this proposal, thereby giving constitutional protection for the enactment by the Oireachtas of the legislation, the terms of which will be seen and approved in advance by the people. Article 40. 3.5º provides that any future legislative amendment to be made to the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2001, must be approved by the people by way of referendum before it is signed into law by the President. A key element of the proposal is that the amendment will only take effect if, within 180 days, the Oireachtas enacts the Bill in exactly the same terms as the text seen and approved by the people at the referendum. This mechanism of making a constitutional amendment conditional on a later legal development was successfully used in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement. The Minister is to be congratulated on putting this issue on a legislative basis where it belongs. The constitutional changes ensure that this legislation has a sound constitutional base coupled with the effect of giving the people reassurance that they will be consulted in the event of change being proposed in the future. During the last debate people felt that there was some back door mechanism which would mean that they would not be consulted and they feared that any glitch might lead to abortion on demand. The fact that any future legislative amendment to the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, must be approved by the people by way of referendum ensures that those calling for complete legalisation of abortion cannot succeed without the people first being consulted about any such future proposal. Although it places the entire matter primarily in the legislative domain, the proposed amendment takes on board and acknowledges the reality that the abortion issue is near and dear to the hearts of the people and a matter on which they want to have the final decision now and in the future. The proposed amendment will protect both women and the unborn in pregnancy. This is welcome and should be highlighted. In addition, it will accommodate existing medical practice which safeguards the life of the woman from exposure to real and substantial risk. The current approach will, therefore, protect the best medical practice while providing for a prohibition on abortion. I also welcome the amendment because it creates a basis for the legislative protection of human life in pregnancy. It will ensure the maximum degree of protection for unborn human life in pregnancy while, at the same time, ensuring a pregnant woman will receive necessary medical treatment to protect her life. This is achieved by the Bill excluding from the definition of abortion any medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved [1353] place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction. The Bill, therefore, affords maximum protection to the unborn while, at the same time, ensuring that women in pregnancy who are suffering from certain life-threatening medical conditions receive all necessary medical treatment. The proposed law also provides that the risk of suicide will no longer be a ground for legal abortion in the State and I welcome this development. It overturns the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case, which had the potential to commence an inevitable slide towards freely available social abortion in Ireland. It must be pointed out that the suicide risk has been advanced only in cases where the State sought to restrict the freedom of a woman to travel abroad for an abortion. It should be noted that the terms of the new law do not attempt to restrict this right to travel, which was enshrined in the Constitution following the referendum in 1992. In addition to the measures outlined in the Bill, the Government has decided to establish a dedicated agency, to which Deputy Fox referred, to help reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and to ensure that all arms of the State work together to help women who find themselves in such a situation. I support the proposals and I hope the issue can be debated in the coming months without the divisiveness of previous abortion referenda.;3243243

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;F;Ms. Jan O'Sullivan;The Labour Party;I fear this debate will add to the cynical or indifferent view of politics held by many Irish people. It is estimated that 7,000 Irish women will have abortions this year, which means we have one of the highest rates of abortion in Europe. Irish women's abortions do not take place on Irish territory. Instead of addressing the real issue, public representatives are being asked to try to include an exact wording in the Constitution to balance the conflicting rights of a mother and her unborn foetus. This seems to happen once every decade, but we have to ask if we will ever succeed. The issue has been addressed seriously in this debate, particularly by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has just acknowledged that there are no simple words that can be put in the Constitution to resolve the complex matter of the conflicting rights of two humans, a mother and [31]her unborn child. It is impossible to determine an appropriate wording. Have we learnt nothing from 1983 and 1992? Do we not believe the X and C cases happened? Is it not likely that we will get it wrong for a third time? Do we have a guarantee that the proposal to be put before the people in this case is better than that in 1983 or 1992? While this House engages in a hand-wringing ritual, a Riverdance on the pure stage of holy Ireland, 7,000 people go to England to have abortions. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has rightly said, little or no attention is being given to the plight of such women. Instead, we are once more concentrating on trying to get an appropriate wording into the Constitution. Has this debate made a difference to the numbers of Irish women travelling for abortions? That the estimated number of women who will travel for an abortion has increased this year, to 7,000, suggests it is obvious the debate has not had an impact. On this occasion, the people are being asked if they would like to change the 1992 decision, when a physical or mental threat to the life of a pregnant woman was considered an appropriate reason to allow a woman to choose to have an abortion. It is now proposed that the mental threat should not be considered an appropriate reason. It is considered that in 1992, an emotional reaction to a particular case made the people a little irrational. They say we may be more calm and rational on this occasion. What if there is another case, which appears to be as unlikely as the X or C cases? What if a woman says she fears she may take her own life in a moment of despair, as the circumstances of her pregnancy have made her distressed and upset? In such a scenario, the law would not allow her to consider abortion. If she attempts suicide and is brought to the accident and emergency department of her local hospital, it may be considered that her life is in physical danger. The legislation that it is proposed to include in the Constitution means that in such circumstances, she may be allowed to terminate her pregnancy. If her suicide attempt is successful, we will have failed to save her life or that of her unborn child. Such a possibility means we should think again. Should we have intervened before her distraught state led her to attempt to kill herself? I do not believe such a case is less likely than the X or C cases. If it happened after we had changed the Constitution according to these proposals, the Irish people would react, as in the X and C cases, by saying that attempts should have been made to intervene when the lives of the woman and her unborn child could have been saved. I put this case forward as we seem to be proceeding with the view that we have got it right on this occasion. We got it wrong in 1983 and 1992, however. The issue of abortion is too complicated to put into the Constitution in this manner. If this legislation is put into the Constitution, as proposed, it is likely there will have to be another referendum in a number of years. I am alarmed [32]to hear the concerns expressed by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who is a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution, about departing from normal procedure by putting an entire Bill into the Constitution. The Deputy said that such a move is dangerous. What will happen if a psychiatrist says to his medical colleagues he believes a patient who is threatening suicide will carry out the threat? What should the psychiatrist's colleagues do? I am posing genuine questions that should be discussed before we career once more into the certainty of 1983, when we believed we had found the right way. I was involved in the 1983 campaign and I remember that those of us who opposed the amendment asked how the balance of rights between the mother and her unborn child was to be addressed. We were told that our concerns were groundless. When we continued to ask questions about the use of the morning after pill and certain methods of contraception, we were accused of wanting to kill babies. It was as simple as that in 1983 and accusations flew at the time. The very people who pushed for the amendment in 1983 decided, because of the judgments in the Supreme Court, that in fact the wording was wrong and needed to be changed. So we had the referendum in 1992 and now we propose another which will probably be held in 2002. We are again asking people to make difficult decisions in relation to the Constitution. I believe that we should legislate instead for what was decided by the people in 1992. We should address the issue of legislation seriously and should consult psychiatrists, medical people and those with strong theological beliefs and should try to get the legislation as close as possible to what the majority of Irish people want – to exclude abortion on demand. We should incorporate the views of the people in legislation rather than try again to encompass such a complex issue in the Constitution. Procedures like the morning after pill and certain contraceptive methods are accepted as part of the compromise being proposed in this constitutional amendment and legislation. Since when did they become morally acceptable to those who led the campaign in 1983? Are they satisfied that this issue, which was such a fundamental moral principle in 1983, is now being dealt with by a political compromise? Some of them are not. I refer in particular to Nora Bennis, a woman in my constituency who has campaigned with clarity and consistency on this issue. She has declared publicly that she is against the proposed amendment to the Constitution because she believes that human life begins at conception. She believes the morning after pill causes abortion to which she is absolutely opposed in all circumstances. I respect that position. To be honest, I am not quite sure when human life begins, whether it is at conception or at implantation. I am not a scientist and I have no moral certainty with regard to the issue. I understand that some people do and, as Deputy [33]O'Keeffe said, all those who sent us those postcards apparently have moral certainty on the issue. The Government proposals do not encompass the sincerely held views of those people or those of someone like Nora Bennis. Neither do they encompass the views of Deputy Neville and others concerned by the trivialisation of suicide in this debate. These proposals are a political compromise designed to get the Government off the hook of a promise it should not have made. Suicide is an issue that needs to be addressed seriously. We cannot simply dismiss the issue of suicide with regard to a pregnant woman because people can quote statistics which show a pregnant woman is less likely to commit suicide than a woman in other circumstances. Of course that is true. Most women are delighted to be pregnant and look forward to the birth of a child with pleasure and experience the first movement of life in their womb as probably one of the most extraordinary, positive experiences of their lives. However, for a small number of women it is life threatening. We should address this issue in legislation and have proper debate on the use and wording of that legislation in order to address the people's concerns that there could be a loophole for, as the Minister described it, social abortion. I do not know what social abortion is but I genuinely respect the view of people who feel that a threat of suicide could be used by somebody who just wanted an abortion for a reason the majority of Irish people would feel inappropriate. Surely we can find wording in legislation that will address that issue. We can take the issue of suicide seriously enough not to completely reject the possibility that a distraught pregnant woman might consider it and might succeed. The case I referred to earlier is a genuinely possible case in the circumstances in which abortion is discussed in Ireland. One of our problems is that we discuss the issue in these almost abstract terms in the House but we are dealing with 7,000 women who actually decide that they are going to have this procedure carried out. These women live in the same towns and villages as ourselves and we know them, even if we are not aware they have had an abortion. Their motivation varies but in some cases it has probably to do with the terror of having to tell their nearest and dearest that they are pregnant. I welcome the fact that we are setting up a pregnancy agency which will address this issue. This is positive and we should discuss how it will work and how it will reach women who do not go to existing bodies such as family planning clinics, CURA, etc. There are concerns about addressing this issue and about getting to the women likely to take such a decision. Many women probably take it because of immaturity. They do not know what to do and have no concept of what it is about. Their immediate reaction is to get rid of the problem. This agency is what we should be providing and is the positive side of what is being [34]proposed but we do not need a constitutional referendum to do this. This could have been done in the last four and a half years during the lifetime of the Government. It should have been done long before now. We could use legislation to address the threat to the life of the mother but what we have in these proposals is essentially a piece of political expediency. We are trying to address an issue that is not appropriate to the Constitution. We should amend the Constitution but in other ways and in order to make a real difference. Instead of this proposed amendment we should use the time and energy being put into this to address issues that will make a real difference. This will not make any difference for the women who go to England and have abortions. There are citizens in this country whose constitutional protection is less than that of their fellow citizens. They are people with disabilities, the homeless and people without access to basic social and economic rights. These issues should be addressed by way of constitutional amendment and that would make a real difference to people's lives. As it is, we are again on the once a decade round of trying to include in the Constitution wording that will protect the rights of the unborn and the rights of the woman. One of those lives is dependent on the other before the child is born. I ask the Government not to proceed with this method of dealing with the issue. Instead we should draft agreed legislation in consultation with those with opinions and expertise in this regard. I would include the psychiatric side of the medical profession in that. We should proceed with the agency this move is welcome. I welcome also the fact that health boards are finally coming to terms with the fact that they have an obligation to women who have had abortions. In the last couple of weeks the health board in my own area organised an information meeting for GPs on post abortion counselling and treatment. This positive step will help us avoid the situation, as outlined by Deputy McManus, where Irish women are put on antibiotics when they have abortions in England because it is assumed that they will not go back to their GPs. That is also a positive step. We must deal with reality and we should have dealt with it a long time ago. If we had done so we would not see large numbers of women going to Britain for abortions. If people felt they could talk about this issue, we would not have large numbers of scared women crossing to England for abortion. A certain number of women will continue to take that option. In accepting the right to travel and information the Government and others acknowledge this. In taking a high moral ground approach instead of dealing with the real issue we will keep it underground and will never discuss the real issues which make women take this option. We are about to put the Irish people into the impossible situation of trying to decide what is [35]appropriate to the Constitution in order to balance these rights. We should move on from 1992 and legislate appropriately for the decision taken by the Irish people at that time. Above all, we should address the real lives of women who take the decision to have an abortion and the very high abortion rate among Irish people. I hope the Government will reconsider its decision. It may well lose the referendum because the Government proposal is a political compromise. There are more appropriate, more humane and more effective ways of dealing with this issue.;3244328
1971;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Mr. Dan Neville;Fine Gael;Last evening I dealt specifically with the issue of suicide and termination of pregnancy in the case of a person who is suicidal. There is still stigma surrounding the whole area of suicide and while much has been done since the report of the national task force on suicide, there is a dearth of discussion and understanding of the complexity of suicide. Last year more than £21 million was spent on road safety and £1. 2 million on suicide prevention. However, more people die as a result of suicide than die on our roads. The issue of suicide in pregnancy has been simplified during the discussion, both in the House and outside. Suicide is a very complex issue and there is a debate over whether women who are suicidal and pregnant should be allowed to have an abortion. I do not accept that. I see women who are pregnant and suicidal who can be treated and recover. There are women who are suicidal who can be shepherded through their pregnancies and come out at the end of it cured. However, there is a small number of cases of women who are suicidal, who are intent on taking their lives and whose lives are in danger if those pregnancies are not terminated. I accept this is a very small number of women, but these are real people. In the Bill, the Government has rightly determined that an intervention can be made in the event of a threat to the woman's life because of physical illness. Is it not discriminating to say that if there is a real and substantial threat to a woman's life because of mental illness and the intent to take her life, a termination should not take [15]place? Surely we are applying different standards in deciding on a termination in the event of a real threat to the life of a mother because of a physical illness and having a different standard for those who are severely mentally ill and suicidal. A pregnant woman who is suicidal would probably not be in position to travel because of the seriousness of her condition. The few people whose lives are threatened because of pregnancy are seriously ill and may not be physically or mentally capable of travelling for abortion to the UK. On the Order of Business, the question of litigation in health and medical care was raised. This issue should be seriously examined by the Government because doctors, physicians and psychiatrists should have protection. I would be extremely concerned about any suggestion of litigation in a case where a psychiatrist decides an abortion should not take place and the woman subsequently dies by suicide. In his contribution, the Minister stated that the Bill removes the possibility of abortion if suicide is threatened, which was a central issue in the X and C cases. I do not believe the threat of suicide should simply be a reason for abortion. I referred to the hard case where clinically a person was at a high risk of suicide – it was almost inevitable that she should die by suicide – which is the situation that should be dealt with. If it were permitted, there should be a detailed, controlled procedure for the final decision. A suggestion I received was for independent second and third opinions on the degree of suicidal risk. It is simplistic of the Minister to talk just about threatened suicide as an issue. It is more complex than that. A panel of psychiatrists should be available to the Department of Health and Children to examine any such cases, and people from outside the patient's health board area should be consulted. It is simplistic of the Minister to state that it is difficult to assess if a risk of suicide is genuine. There are risk factors which can be explored concerning the individual herself, such as if she has a severe mental illness. Some 15% of people who are severely mentally ill die by suicide. Previous attempts, the storing of tablets, and the means used are barometers for the psychiatric profession to assess risks. The Minister is being too simplistic when he says it is difficult to assess the risks of suicide because psychiatrists make that decision on an ongoing basis. The Minister stated the Government is satisfied there would not be widespread support for providing abortions to women in crisis pregnancy, which would open the way for abortion on all grounds. What does the Minister mean by a crisis pregnancy? I have not heard it explained. Most people accept it is an unwanted, unplanned pregnancy, but a crisis pregnancy can arise in many situations. A planned pregnancy can become a crisis one and therefore we must be careful in using such language. A person with a planned pregnancy can subsequently have both physical [16]and mental complications which turn it into a crisis. A meeting in Cork was addressed by the internationally recognised compassionate sociologist, Rev. Fr. Charles Ruby, of Chicago who has been involved for many decades with the suicide bereaved. He works with the Catholic charities of the arch-diocese of Chicago and publishes a monthly magazine, Obelisk, Leaving Outreach to the Survivors of Suicide for the suicide bereaved. He said that death from a physical ailment was a consequence of that ailment, in other words, a death from cancer was due to the consequences of that disease. He compared this to suicide as a consequence of a severe mental and despairing disposition or condition. The Government stated that its proposals are specifically drafted to ensure the non-recognition of a risk of suicide as a grounds for lawful termination of a life of the unborn does not result in persons, who would otherwise be free to travel abroad, being refused permission in any circumstances by any court exercising its personal jurisdiction over them from doing so. The Government is saying it is essential to a suicidal disposition that the woman can travel to the UK, and that there is nothing in the proposed amendment or the envisaged legislation that would render it illegal for the health board to assist the woman to travel outside the jurisdiction. People in extreme distress and in a suicidal condition would not be capable of travelling abroad. Some of them would be hospitalised because they need constant psychiatric care. What is the answer for a person in such circumstances? We must put suicide in pregnancy in context. Studies in this area accept that women who are pregnant are less likely to take their lives than those who are not. Louis Appleby's studies over ten years found that the risk of suicide in pregnancy in the UK was one sixth of that expected for non-pregnant women. A total of 14 pregnant women died by suicide between 1973 and 1984, compared to an estimated and statistically expected 281. 5 non-pregnant women. Research shows that pregnant women had one-twentieth of the expected rate of suicide. That led Appleby to say that pregnancy protects women from suicide. The 1999 study in the United States by Marsock shows that a pregnant woman has about one in three-tenths the chance of dying by suicide as that of a non-pregnant woman of similar age. These percentages are low and the dearth of research in the area limits knowledge in the area of the effects of pregnancy on suicide.;3244329
1972;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Mr. Michael Collins;Fianna Fáil;Abortion by its nature is a highly emotive issue. I believe the Government is taking full cognisance of this fact with regard to the policy it is pursuing on abortion. Before speaking in detail about the provisions of the Bill, I would like to make a few brief comments concerning the background to the legislation. In 1983, a pro life amendment to the Constitution was enacted by a decision of the people. However, as a result of that decision, no laws were put in place to deal with the issue of abortion. That means, in effect, that the Offences Against the Persons Act which dates back to 1861 remains the basic law on abortion. Almost ten years later in 1992 the Supreme Court gave the decision in the X case. As we all recall that judgment gave rise to much emotion. Consequently, in November of that year another referendum, which incorporated three new proposals, was put to the people. One issue on the right to travel was approved by the people. Two other issues which sought to reconcile the rights of the mother and the unborn were rejected by the decision of the voters. In effect, no matter which way one looks at the issue of abortion, there is certainly a legislative vacuum. The Fianna Fáil Party, by way of its general election manifesto in 1997, gave a commitment to the Irish people that a pro life referendum would be held. The Government has approached this issue in a very careful and measured manner. In September 1999, a Green Paper on abortion was published by the Government. This Green Paper in turn was referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which reported in November 2000. It was at this stage that the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee to consider its options and to prepare new proposals. In effect, the Government is now seeking to add two new subsections to Article 40. 3 of the Constitution. The first gives constitutional protection for the adoption by the Oireachtas of a legislative approach. This guarantees the terms of the legislation which will be seen and approved by the people in advance. The second option provides that any future legislative amendment must be approved by the people before it is signed into law by the President. Put in its simplest terms, the Government is seeking to put this issue where it belongs, which is on a legislative basis. Hence the publication of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, which is now before the House for consideration. At this point I would like to say that the electorate is being asked to approve a conditional amendment to the Constitution. This means, in effect, that the terms of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act will be enacted. The provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill protects the life of the unborn child. As a politician, I fully support the need to protect [45]the life of the unborn and that is why I very much welcome the measured approach by which the Government is addressing what is clearly a complex and emotive subject. This new law will protect both women and the unborn child and will accommodate existing medical practice which safeguards the life of the woman from exposure to real and substantial risks. The Taoiseach stated, when he launched the Government's proposals for constitutional and legislative reform on abortion, that doing nothing is not an option. He is totally correct in his approach. Doing nothing just simply means that the legal vacuum, which arguably has been in place since 1983, would remain the order of the day. This would be an unacceptable situation. The Taoiseach also stated that the legalisation of abortion is rightly not an option because the Irish people are simply against this. The Irish people have a right to be consulted on this very important issue and I hope, when an abortion referendum is held, the debate which will take place will acknowledge that the Government has carefully weighed up its options and is presenting a very balanced set of proposals to the people. The proposed amendment to the Constitution is designed to acknowledge that the abortion issue is one on which the people want to have the final decision, while, at the same time, leaving the matter primarily within the legislative arena. I agree with the Taoiseach's statement that the inevitable far reaching public debate on these proposals must take place in a spirit of reason, tolerance and open-mindedness. We need a debate to take place in a calm and mature way. One of the proposals which I strongly support in this Bill is the provision to set up a new statutory agency which will be called the crisis pregnancy agency. This is a recommendation which was included in the proposals brought forward by the All Party Committee on the Constitution. I congratulate Deputy Lenihan, as chairman, and all members of that committee for the time and effort which they contributed to their work. The committee proposed the establishment of such an agency to draw up a strategy to combat crisis pregnancies, promote options other than abortion where a crisis pregnancy occurs and to provide for post abortion services. This agency will, in effect, draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancies. It will work with a wide range of organisations, not just in the health sector but in the employment, educational and housing sectors. The Government is allocating €6. 5 million for the running of this agency in the year 2002. It will be established for a period of ten years, as recommended by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Too many Departments, State bodies and voluntary organisations have responsibilities for many aspects relating to crisis pregnancies. It is clear that better co-ordination is needed with regard to the issue of crisis pregnancy and the setting up of such a new agency would serve a very positive function. This crisis [46]pregnancy agency will play a major role in the development of co-ordinated and appropriate services which will reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among Irish women and give women in a very difficult situation the widest possible range of assistance to help them cope. The Government is also anxious that the law should protect best medical practice and remove any doubt about the legality of treatment which doctors may consider necessary. Section 2 states that no persons shall carry out or effect an abortion in this State. A person who contravenes this section or attempts to do so or aids or procures any other person to do so shall be guilty of an offence. Such a person may be liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 years or to a fine. This constitutional amendment and proposed legislation do not have any implications in terms of legal directives and regulations at European level. There is no aspect of European law, and no jurisdiction on the part of any of the European institutions or of the European Court of Justice, which could challenge or prevent the operation of the law envisaged by these proposals. The Government is not running away from addressing the issues connected with the need to protect the life of the unborn child. In fact, the opposite is the case. The Government has carefully measured all its options and has produced a very sensible and balanced set of proposals which will protect the life of the unborn child. The vast majority of the members of this House should support the proposals in this Bill. As the Taoiseach said recently, our basic choice is either to have a constructive debate which achieves as much agreement as possible or to allow matters to drift until the next court case forces us to confront this issue again. The Government is launching the first comprehensive national initiative to help prevent unwanted pregnancies and to support women who find themselves in a crisis pregnancy. I fully support the provisions included in this Bill.;3244330
1973;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Mr. Jim O'Keeffe;Fine Gael;I have the most serious reservations about the Government's proposals. They deserve serious consideration and both I and my party have given them such but at the end of the day one must examine what the outcome of these proposals will be if they are implemented. Essentially, the result of the Government proposals will be to reduce both the rights of the unborn and the rights of women as they exist now. One cannot deny that incontrovertible fact. On that basis I find it very difficult to support such an approach. The problem for the unborn is that the proposals infer that implantation rather than conception is the first moment of life. Thus the proposals provide no protection for the unborn in the period between conception and implantation. As I understand it this period can range up to about 14 days. I heard the medical evidence at the All-Party Committee and I gather that what happens is that it takes six or seven days before the fertilised ovum – at that stage called the blastocyst – begins implantation. Normally by day 14 that implantation is completed. What is very relevant is that section 1 of the proposed Bill very clearly provides protection after implantation. What is the situation about protection in the 14 days prior to implantation? A satisfactory answer has not been given to that question by the Government. These proposals and the result of these proposals will be to reduce the rights of women. Under the proposals a medical procedure as a result of which unborn human life is ended is not regarded as abortion where, in the opinion of the [22]doctor, such is necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life. However, this exemption specifically excludes the risk of loss of the woman's life by self-destruction. What is currently provided for as a result of the Supreme Court decisions in the X and C cases is being excluded. Essentially the Bill says that serious physical conditions are covered by the exemption but not conditions now covered, such as black depression leading to suicidal tendencies. I take the point made by Dr. O'Hanlon when he analysed the evidence before the all-party committee in relation to suicide. I accept the evidence given that the tendency to commit suicide is reduced as a consequence of pregnancy rather than otherwise. However, from the point of both physical and psychiatric conditions these are rare cases. Similarly, the evidence of the masters of the three main maternity hospitals was that these physical conditions are very rare they talked about a few each year where therapeutic procedures had to be carried out which resulted in abortion for reasons of grave physical difficulty experienced by the expectant mother. We are talking about quite rare conditions. Do we condemn those who suffer from those rare conditions to bear with them and perhaps to die? I do not think we as legislators can very easily differentiate between the two. I question the advisability of setting aside the judgment of the Supreme Court in a way that will reduce the rights of women in that regard. I am delighted with the tone of this debate. We had considerable debates at the all-party committee which were conducted under the very able chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I was delighted to be vice-chair and to participate with him in those discussions. They were very serious discussions but everybody tried to contribute in a very fair and reasoned and reasonable and sensitive way. I am pleased that the debate in the House is along the same lines. The onus of proof is on the Government. It must convince the Dáil and the people that there is merit in the proposals. So far, that onus has not been discharged. To a large degree that is the background for the very reasoned approach that Fine Gael is taking to these proposals. We tabled a reasoned amendment because we believe this is a very complex area. The proposals are quite unusual – a constitutional cocktail that has not been seen before. At the time of the all-party committee report we committed ourselves to giving the most serious consideration to any proposals that would be put forward and on that basis we have strongly proposed a deferral of the second reading to allow further time for discussion to allow the Government time to present to the Dáil satisfactory reasons for the mechanisms being proposed. I am quite concerned about that constitutional cocktail and its implication for the Oireachtas and the courts and the public interest. There is no advantage in rushing this Bill. I was a Member of this House in 1982 and 1983 [23]when I saw an amendment that was pushed on the Dáil against the advice of the Attorney General, against the advice of the Minister, and against the advice of the then Government. There was a tide of emotion behind that amendment. I will never forget that because it showed that one does not legislate properly on a tide of emotion in fact those who pushed that amendment found that the chickens came home to roost. The warnings at the time were that the amendment could lead to a judicial interpretation contrary to what the proposers felt they were proposing – and that is what happened. We must be very careful in our legislation and we must be very careful about how we amend the Constitution. I do not approve of the procedures being adopted. The ship of state is heading into uncharted constitutional waters. There were warnings in 1982 as to the unpredictable consequences of the approach then adopted and we must also sound a warning. There are dangers in attempting to graft a constitutional prohibition on to the legislative prohibition. I worry about this approach and that the consequences of that approach may be quite unpredictable and certainly need to be teased out and examined further. I am concerned about a situation where the Government seeks to justify legislation on the statute book which cannot be amended by the Oireachtas but which under its provisions can allow a Minister make regulations without any reference to anybody. That seems to be a very odd approach and it certainly has not been justified by the Government. The Government is saying that one must go back to the people to amend the Bill but at the same time the Minister of the day will be able to make orders under section 5 without even having them approved by the Dáil. I accept that such orders will be laid before the Dáil in the Oireachtas library, just as is the case with hundreds of other orders. Everyone knows the practical effect of that is that, as a consequence, nothing ever happens on the floor of the House. I consider such an approach to be undemocratic and in fact anti-democratic. It is a Committee Stage point but one aspect in relation to section 5 is odd. Under section 5, the Minister is allowed to make such provisions relating to the making of, keeping of and confirmation of records but, under the definition section, there is an implication that he is entitled to establish approved places, which effectively will be hospitals or clinics, where abortions can be carried out. There is no specific power under section 5 to make an order in relation to approved places and perhaps this point could be noted for clarification because it may be defective drafting. The overall point is what type of democracy we have and what type we want. We are part of a tradition of representative democracy. These issues were considered hundreds of years ago in terms of the difference between the direct democracy school and the ideas of Rousseau and the [24]school of representative democracy under which people would be indirectly consulted through representatives, as favoured by John Stuart Mill. Most Western democracies adopted the representative approach, the only exception being Switzerland which uses the direct democracy model. However, what the Government is trying to do under the Bill is contrary to our constitutional and democratic tradition. It is grafting on the direct democracy approach to our existing constitutional and democratic model, which is dangerous. The Minister referred to the 100,000 submissions and representations that were made to the all-party committee. I analysed many of them and 95,000 of them demanded support for option one in the Green Paper, which is an absolute constitutional ban on abortion. The postcards and petitions were organised throughout the country because some people genuinely believe that is the right approach they got 95,000 people to sign petitions and write postcards along those lines. However, it was clear from the evidence given to the all-party committee that if that route had been followed, women could have been condemned to death. One could not accept an absolute constitutional ban on abortion because it would effectively outlaw existing medical procedures in the rare cases where therapeutic intervention is required, resulting in the termination of pregnancy, to save the life of a mother. This is a warning to us. People who favour a further referendum at this stage in the main accept that option one, an absolute constitutional ban on abortion, is out the window. They accept the medical evidence given to the all-party committee in that regard. However, they now want some type of half way measure. Their approach is that half a loaf is better than no bread. My view is that the half a loaf approach could give rise to severe constitutional indigestion because a half baked half loaf could cause damage. It could produce unpredictable results and make the situation worse in the future. The idea that there should be some type of referendum on some type of half baked half loaf, rather than no referendum, will do nothing for those who are genuinely concerned that abortion could become available in Ireland. I do not believe that approach would in any way guarantee the desired result. My view is that we must proceed with extreme caution. Unless we are convinced beyond reasonable doubt, we should not proceed at all along the constitutional route. I question why we are involved in this exercise at all because we are not having a serious debate about abortion. The first point about any policy that is supposed to address the issue of abortion is whether it will reduce the number of Irish women who have abortions. The answer is 'no' because, irrespective of the type of constitutional or legislative procedures that are put in place, they will have no impact whatsoever on abortions carried out in Ireland given that there is none. The only abortions carried out are those under [25]approved medical procedures to save the life of the mother. Nevertheless, 7,000 Irish women and girls have abortions each year and these proposals will not affect one of them. It is also important to remember that the X case judgment had no impact of any kind on current medical practice in hospitals. No abortions are carried out in the State because of the threat of suicide and the Medical Council guidelines suggest that any doctor who performs such an abortion would be guilty of professional misconduct. We want to exclude suicide as a ground but this was put before the people in 1992. In substance, we have returned to the position in 1992 when that proposal was rejected by two to one. We should be debating the £50 million plan that I, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, proposed to the all-party committee 18 months ago. There is no debate on that plan because serious issues arise in terms of how it should be implemented. Another aspect is that because of the time being spent on considering legislative and constitutional proposals, which will have no impact whatsoever on the rate of abortion, we are not expending energy on considering what type of proper plan should be put in place to help the women involved and establish preventative and educational measures. We should decide whether to adopt a contraceptive approach or one of the other approaches advocated before the committee. However, nothing is being done about this aspect. I am glad that 18 months after I bored the committee to tears by pressing this issue at every meeting there is a proposal to set up an agency, which will be operative next year. Why are we not debating what that agency should do to bring about a result? What type of support will be available to young girls or women in crisis pregnancies? What support in terms of counselling and medical check-ups will be provided to women who have had abortions? These aspects are not being debated. If we are really concerned about reducing the rate of abortion and supporting women and girls with crisis pregnancies, we should debate issues such as what we can do in practical terms for them. The approach adopted by the Government in sailing into uncharted constitutional waters is dangerous. There is a risk that the use of a constitutional amendment as a procedure to accommodate specific legislation in the Constitution could establish an undesirable precedent in so far as a similar approach might be used to facilitate interference with other constitutional rights. The Oireachtas must reflect carefully before adopting any particular technical approach of that type because of its potential to reduce or alter other existing rights in the future. On that basis, I strongly urge the Government to accept the Fine Gael Party's amendment and to defer the Second Reading of the Bill.;3244331

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Dr. Rory O'Hanlon;Fianna Fáil;I know of Deputy Neville's great interest in suicide and I was surprised that he accused the Government of discriminating against women who are suicidal by not allowing them to have a termination of pregnancy. I would have thought he would have had the evidence that was presented to the All-party Committee on the Constitution as well as medical evidence from all around the world. That evidence takes a [17]view contrary to Deputy Neville's, the facts are there to be seen. Pregnancy is not a risk factor in suicide. Deputy Neville referred to the Appleby study which showed that pregnant women aged 15-44 were 20 times less likely to commit suicide than non-pregnant women. Pokorney in the United States found that 0. 6 per 100,000 pregnant women committed suicide while the rate for non-pregnant women was 3. 5 per 100,000.;3244332

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Dr. Rory O'Hanlon;Fianna Fáil;The Deputy accused the Government last night, he said, 'It is discriminatory to say a woman who is seriously suicidal and who is suffering from a serious mental health condition cannot be protected in terms of terminating her pregnancy while this can be done where a woman is in real danger due to a physical illness.' All the medical evidence points to the contrary. A study in Finland showed that while pregnancy is a potent protector against suicide, induced abortion appears to be a risk factor. The survey showed that 73 women who committed suicide from 1987 to 1994 found a mean annual suicide rate of 11. 3 per 100,000 the suicide rate associated with birth was 5. 9 and that associated with induced abortion was 34. 7. I am sure that neither Professor Casey, the professor of psychiatry at UCD, or Dr. Kevin Malone, who is probably doing the most research on an all-Ireland basis, would agree with Deputy Neville. They are certainly not saying that they are unhappy with the Bill. When the Supreme Court dealt with the X case, the late Dr. Kelleher – who had a very distinguished record in research into suicide in this country – pointed out that '[suicide] is a rare event and in all rare events the greatest likelihood is that the event will not occur. The research evidence indicates that medicine and psychology does not have ability to predict suicide, even with a moderate degree of accuracy.' A number of doctors attended the hearings of the All-party Committee on the Constitution including Dr. Sean Daly, Master of the Coombe, Dr. Peter McKenna, Master of the Rotunda, Dr. Anthony Clare, director of St. Patrick's Hospital, Dr. John Sheehan, consultant psychiatrist at the Rotunda and Dr. Hannah McGee representing Psychologists for Freedom of Information and they all had the same view. The general thrust of findings presented was that completed suicide during pregnancy is significantly reduced over [18]and above the levels in non-pregnant women of similar ages.;3244336

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Mr. Andrew Boylan;Fine Gael;I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I support the proposed wording of the twenty-fifth amendment to the Constitution. If the wording was factual, I would have absolutely no difficulty with the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill. Life is sacred and the voice for the unborn must be heard. I welcome the debate in so far as it is level and very well balanced and the heat and bitterness generated in previous debates has not surfaced. The contributions to the debate this morning were excellent. I welcome the definite statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, that abortion on demand will not be introduced into this country. That is a commendable and noteworthy statement. I listened with interest to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's comment that we should hasten slowly, with which I agree. I was amazed and appalled by the information given by Deputy [47]O'Sullivan that 7,000 women sought abortion outside this country last year. That is sad and frightening. Such events are described as crisis or unplanned pregnancies, which terminology I do not understand. In querying the wording of the amendment, I pose the question: When does life begin? We are told it is at implantation – I do not understand that. It is my understanding that life begins at conception. If life does not begin at conception, what actually happens at conception? Those issues have to be addressed. It is a sad reflection on our society that so many women consider it necessary to terminate a pregnancy. I can only speak as a lay person. I have no medical or scientific qualification. I can speak as a parent and as a public representative who has dealt with people's social and personal problems for 25 years both at local authority level and at national level since I became a Deputy in 1987. There are tremendously difficult social problems and these have not improved despite the fact that the country has progressed. We have become more affluent and young people have more disposable income. However, there is a tremendous abuse of this affluence. There is a major problem of drink and drugs. Is it as a result of the abuse of drink and drugs that what are called crisis or unplanned pregnancies come about? I believe it is related and therefore we must address that issue. We must help young people to understand. The facts of life are well known now, certainly much more than was the case decades ago. Young people clearly understand the activity in which they are getting involved. However, much of this comes about because of an abuse of their social lives, which is sad. I am aware that 80% to 90% of our young people are marvellous, well-mannered and good living people. However, there are others that do not appear capable of behaving in a proper manner that would give them a better life without any of these problems. At my clinic and my home, young pregnant girls of 15, 16 or 17 have come to me. They are afraid to tell their parents or seek help. On one occasion a teacher came to me asking how she should address the problem relating to a pupil in her leaving certificate class. Such a problem causes turmoil in that young person's mind and creates a huge upheaval in her life. The first requirement is to have support services and somebody to whom that person can turn. She needs help through the health boards, local health authorities and local community workers. There are many people willing to help but certainly abortion is not the answer for that girl's problem. Abortion is wrong, full stop. It is wrong here and it is not acceptable for women to go abroad for abortions. It is wrong here it is wrong in Britain, where apparently it is freely available and it is wrong in any European country. We cannot export our problems. People talk about an Irish [48]solution to an Irish problem. Well, we have an Irish problem. On Monday night, I attended the launch of a card to verify the age of young people to help prevent people selling alcohol to under age drinkers. This is being promoted by the Garda Síochána and the liaison officers. That is a marvellous development. It is an indication of the concern people have about what is happening in society that we had over 150 people from different public bodies, health bodies, community councils and community workers attending that meeting to see how they could help. They also recognise there is a problem in our society. If we approach it from that angle, the number of young girls becoming pregnant could be substantially reduced. There are cases of older women who want to terminate pregnancies claiming they will commit suicide otherwise. I am aware of families where suicide has occurred. They are often traumatised and particularly bewildered that the victim gave no indication of being ill. People do not go around saying they are going to commit suicide and then carry it out. However, a person threatening suicide if she does not get an abortion or if something does not happen for her is crying for help. That help and support must be available. There are many couples that have no family and are only too willing to adopt a baby. There are other people who may have raised a family already and are willing to foster a baby. Help is available but obviously these people are not aware of it. They must be made aware of it. Contact numbers for crisis pregnancy agencies are available at public clinics and other centres, but obviously that is not sufficient and they are not getting to the people with the problem. I do not accept the threat of suicide as a reason for allowing a woman to have an abortion. I can cite the case of a boy of 18 who took his father's car without permission and went to see his girl friend. They went for a drive, had a crash and the wee girl was killed. That young boy was convicted of dangerous driving causing death and was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, which he is now serving. He is anxious to do so in order to try to repay his debt to the family of the girl and to society. What is the difference between the death in that case and an abortion? We must be prepared to help these people. We are wrong to think we will solve the problem by stating that life does not begin until some date after implantation and conception. Cases of rape occur and it is a terrible indictment on our society that there are brutes that are prepared to abuse a young girl or woman in this manner, either individually or in gangs. Where that happens, the victim should immediately seek help from the authorities as well as medical help. I mean that she should get to her doctor or to a hospital immediately. I cannot accept the argument that a woman can claim two months later that she was raped. This does happen and although thankfully it is [49]not widespread, there have been horrific incidents. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended at 1. 30 p. m. and resumed at 2. 30 p. m.;3244337
1980;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Mr. Brian Joseph Lenihan RIP;Fianna Fáil;This is a very sensitive question and not an easy one for any Member of this House to address. The question of whether the Government may lose this referendum was raised a moment ago. Of course, it is not a matter of the Government losing the referendum or not. The people will have to make up their own minds on this question. How do we proceed to make a decision on this question? Many citizens of this country were unhappy about being consulted on this matter in 1983 but they were consulted and they made a decision. As a result of that, any further approach we wish to take on the substantive issue which was discussed in the 1983 referendum campaign and by the Supreme Court in the X case must be submitted to the people for their decision. It is not politically practicable in this State to make any progress in one direction or the other without a referendum. I appreciate the position the Labour Party canvassed at the hearings conducted by the all-party committee. That party's position has been consistent. It wishes to see legislation to implement the various aspects of the X case and to give concrete shape to it. However, when that option was canvassed at the all-party committee it did not find favour with either of the two major parties. The first approach penned by the Fine Gael Party indicated that that party does not favour such legislation. It took the view that the judgment involved in deciding whether a particular threat of suicide is real is a subjective one, that Irish medical personnel had not acted on the two judgments made by the courts in this area and showed no disposition to do so in the future. When the Labour Party option was canvassed at the all-party committee neither of the major parties supported it. I accept that the Labour Party position on this issue is a valid, political one. It is a compromise position between those who expressed a particular view at the Labour Party conference and those with a different view within the party. This is an issue which divides members of all political parties. Ultimately, the political parties will have to stand back from this debate and let the people decide the question on the basis of information submitted to them. No one likes being asked the question but I cannot see how we can resolve a difficult philosophical question such as this without submitting [36]it to the will of the people. There are those who have argued that it should be a right of choice for a woman to decide this question and there are those who argue, on the other hand, that unborn life is worthy of legal and constitutional protection and of moral respect. Between those positions it is very difficult to make a judgment and I do not know how parliamentarians can provide for legislation. We can, as the Minister has sought to do, remove the matter from vague constitutional formulae and try to find a workable legal solution in practical statutory terms. That is what this proposal entails. I welcome that aspect of the proposal. It is legislative in form. I appreciate the understandable reservations that have been expressed about the mode of enactment of this proposal. It is proposed that the people will empower the Oireachtas to enact legislation which has been shown to the people in advance of the referendum. In the light of my conviction that we will not make any progress with this issue unless we are up front with the people, I am happy that the Government is telling the people exactly what is on offer. A clear proposal is being submitted to the people. In 1983 and 1992 vague and general constitutional formulae were submitted to the people and there were endless arguments and public debates about what the formulae meant, might mean or would mean. That approach has not been adopted on this occasion. The Government is giving the people clear sight of what is proposed. No legal scholar or lawyer of note or repute has suggested any unconstitutionality or constitutional impropriety in the approach the Government has taken. Article 46 of the Constitution permits the people to amend their Constitution. This is a matter for the people. Some Fine Gael speakers have stressed the point that we cannot amend the Constitution in this way. In 1937 when the Constitution was brought in the same party said that Mr. de Valera did not have the right to go back to the people and get their judgment on it. This is what we are doing in this instance in the only practicable way we can do so. If we were to implement the legislation in the form in which the Labour Party seeks to have it, with the suicide risk fully written into the legislation, I do not believe the Oireachtas would be able to enact such legislation without some reference back to the people. Such legislation would not have the communal sanction that a decision of that type would require. We must learn from the experience of the United States. Different approaches were taken by different states of the United States on this question. The matter fell to be decided by the Supreme Court in the famous decision of Roe and Wade, when the United States Supreme Court decided, as a matter of constitutional law, that within the United States abortion facilities should be provided on a graded basis with abortion on request in the first trimester of pregnancy and a more restricted regime for the second trimester. That decision has caused immense political [37]controversy in the United States. It has led to the politicisation of appointments to the judiciary and has never commanded the respect of the people of America. At each presidential election the issue comes up again and again. The reason for this is that the decision was not taken by the American people but by judges. People are unhappy with the idea of such a fundamental matter of life and death being decided by the courts without reference to the people. The Supreme Court in the X case rightly criticised legislators for failing in our obligation to legislate. If we do not legislate it is inevitable that the courts will do so. It is not desirable, either for the courts or for our political system, that the courts are left in the position of having to legislate. Dr. T. K. Whitaker addressed this very issue before the all-party committee. It was put to him very strongly by the Fine Gael members that it should suffice to establish some form of agency and tackle the real problem of the large number of crisis pregnancies. I accept the real problem is the high number of crisis pregnancies, although no woman who had been through that experience appeared before the all-party committee and said she would like abortion facilities to be provided in the State. However, the committee had the benefit of the Trinity College study, referred to in this debate. T. K. Whitaker was asked if a package to tackle the problem of crisis pregnancy would be adequate but he took the view that it would be an evasion of responsibility in that it would mean leaving to the courts awkward decisions, such as the X case. The public was not happy with that decision. The responsibility of Parliament is to set out the guidelines of laws as clearly as they can and not to leave deliberately to the courts the settlement of obscurities. That is what we will do if we do not legislate in this matter. By adopting the legislative approach I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken the opportunity to remove a number of obscurities. One matter raised by many speakers is the question of when life begins. The legislation does not address that matter. It addresses the question of when the crime of abortion is committed. The questions raised by some speakers regarding in vitro fertilisation are being looked at by a separate commission dealing with assisted human reproduction. That issue must be looked at. I thank my colleagues from all parties for their magnificent work on the all party committee and I hope this commission will approach its work in a similar way and try to lay the foundation of a balanced debate. No decisions on that issue are being made in this legislation, which deals with another issue. I have some sympathy with those who ask if it would be possible to repeal the provision inserted in the Constitution in 1983 and start again. That is not possible. We must deal with the current situation and decide on the best practicable solution. If the people decide not to favour this measure it may be because, as in 1992, a combi[38]nation from both sides find the proposal unacceptable. However, I believe they will look on this proposal with care because it has been drafted with considerable care and is based on an extensive period of consultation conducted by the all-party committee. I accept that when inferences are drawn from evidence many different conclusion can be reached. However, it is important that the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which was of considerable help to the all-party committee, has written an open letter to the Minister confirming its support for the Bill and wishing the Government every success in the implementation of the measure. The institute did not work with the interdepartmental committee which prepared the Green Paper but in evidence to the all-party committee, a number of witnesses from the institute, representing a spectrum of opinion, established in an authoritative way contemporary practices and perceptions. Medical and clinical practice can be a dynamic, evolving practice and is not necessarily fixed or rigid in its implications. The institute is satisfied the legislation meets its concerns. Understandable concern has been expressed about the question of the suicide risk. In assessing evidence, different conclusions can be reached but an indisputable fact from the hearings we conducted is that no abortion, termination or procedure on that ground has ever been carried out in this jurisdiction. I do not want to beg the choice of words on this subject because words themselves can be lethal. As chairman of the all-party committee I was struck by the extent to which they can have an ideological rather than a practical significance. In view of this it is necessary to put side by side with the fears expressed, past practice and what doctors want to do in the future. This must be built in to current medical practice and that is the perception of the medical profession. Its endorsement of this proposal means we must consider it with great care. The one great practical merit in the legislative approach is that it puts the question of the protection of the expectant mother in a maternity hospital beyond any legal doubt whatsoever. When we conducted our hearings there were considerable doubts about the precise legal position. There was a conflict between the guidelines outlined by the Medical Council, the constitutional position outlined in the X case and the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, the basic statutory provision under which we operate. The effect of the Government's proposals is to draw together all these elements. The great merit of having a statutory position is that the legislation is laid out in black and white in accordance with the well established schemes of statutory construction and interpretation. We are not leaving the matter open, as would a constitutional formula, to vague general interpretation in the courts. A precise guideline is being laid down, which will benefit all concerned. The point has been made that while we may [39]settle that issue we are far from settling the far wider, deeper, human and emotional tragedy involved. The Government and all of the parties on the all-party committee pressed strongly for the establishment of an agency that would look at this problem in a realistic way, would take the subject of sexuality in Ireland away from the bar counter and the casual joke and consider it in a modern context to see how the issues of education, counselling, including counselling those who have had abortions, prevention, abstention, contraception and care could be drawn together in a compassionate, sympathetic and tolerant approach that would state where we stand today on all these issues. I welcome the fact that the Government has established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and the impressive membership appointed to it. It is important for the agency to commence work. This Bill contains a precise proposal on which the people will have to decide but it is being submitted to them in the context of the establishment of an agency which looks at documents such as the Trinity College study and surveys, many of which have been haphazard in their approach and not fully thought out in terms of orientation and where they should be going. It will examine the problem as it stands and see what can be done about it. That is a practical way of making some progress on this issue. On the wider constitutional issue posed by the legislation, there is no constitutional difficulty with the particular mode of enactment. Article 46 of the Constitution provides that a Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of the Constitution shall not contain any other proposal but I am satisfied this is not another proposal because it is open to the Oireachtas to enact this legislation afterwards. There is ample authority that the courts do not interfere with the sovereign right of the people to decide what should be in the Constitution. This proposal has been thought through and the Government has carefully examined the report of the all-party committee. Different people have very different perceptions of this issue, but far from this being unique to Ireland, similar debates have taken place in other countries. Likewise, it will be asked why so many people travel to England and whether we are being hypocritical and failing to face up to our responsibilities. However, another feature of the abortion debate around the world is that there are many jurisdictions to and from which people come and go to avail of particular services. The UK has one of the most liberal abortion regimes in the world and we are in close proximity to it. I do not believe any abortion law ideally devised in the House would ever meet the requirement of those who seek to avail of services in England as the services there, as in some other jurisdictions, are available on a very liberal scale. There are many other European jurisdictions where there are regular movements of people and recourse to facilities available in other countries. Equally, it is [40]clear that those countries which have introduced liberal, widely available abortion have had huge controversies within their medical profession and among the public regarding the morality of what they are doing. This is a very difficult question and parties will have to draw back a bit from the debate. I welcome the fact this has, by and large, been the tone of the debate in the House and in the all-party committee. In terms of legislation on sexuality we have made fools of ourselves many times through the years, including on censorship, contraception and abortion, and I hope on this occasion we can conduct the debate in a civilised way, look at ourselves as a people and see if we can make a decision which addresses at least some of the problems we face on this issue. It is never possible to find an ideal solution to this problem. This can be one of the difficulties with the motivation of many who argue the points, but the Government has arrived at a conclusion on the matter and has submitted proposals to the people which are worthy of very serious consideration and give the people a real chance to find a workable solution to this problem for this generation at least.;3244338

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Dr. Rory O'Hanlon;Fianna Fáil;They pointed out that for every 100 cases of suicide predicted, the prophecy was wrong 97 times. The evidence of Dr. Anthony Clare is also worth looking at. He said: If I were to summarise, I would say that the only real reason . . . you will find psychiatrists involved in this is, because, . . . we have been drawn in to try and get people off the hook over this issue . . . who better than to get the psychiatrist to tell you that if this is refused, this woman will kill herself. Well no such statement can be made with any great safety, whether the person making it is a psychologist, psychiatrist or a general practitioner. As a medical doctor and a former general practitioner, my main concern with the judgment of the Supreme Court was that it would open the way for abortion on demand. Suicide is a subjective feeling. If a woman were to go to her doctor and say she was going to commit suicide if she could not have a termination of pregnancy, no doctor – psychiatrist or GP – or anybody else is in a position to say if she will or will not commit suicide. It could lead to abortion on demand and that is one of the reasons I am delighted to see the Government going back to the circumstances that existed prior to the Supreme Court decision. The Commission of Enquiry into the Abortion Act, 1967, in England was chaired by Lord Rawlinson. It reported: The Commission heard from witnesses representing the Royal College of Psychiatrists who stated that although the majority of abortions are carried out on the ground of danger to the mother's health, there is no psychiatric justification for abortion. Thus the Commission believes that to perform abortions on this ground is not only questionable in terms of compliance with the law, but also puts women at risk of suffering a psychiatric disturbance after abortion without alleviating any psychiatric problems that already exist. The woman who has depression or who feels suicidal during pregnancy, is certainly entitled to full services support, but the answer is to offer appropriate psychiatric help. The full range of psychiatric services should be and are available to those women. I welcome the Bill. The title of it explains what it is about, the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. The protection of human life places a major responsibility on the State and on the professionals who have responsibility for ensuring a safe pregnancy. It is always important to recognise that there are two lives involved – the mother and the child in the womb. This legis[19]lation is caring, compassionate and balanced. It provides for the woman and her child and at the same time ensures that medical procedures necessary to save the life of the mother will not be denied. Before the 1997 general election, the Taoiseach promised the people that they would have the final decision on this by way of referendum. He is now fulfilling that promise. I am disappointed at Members of the Oireachtas who do not want a referendum. Everybody has to accept that a referendum is the greatest act of democracy that is available to the people. It is right to allow the people to make a decision by way of referendum on this tremendously important issue. It is also right that the legislation, when enacted, can only be changed by way of referendum. It would not make much sense to consult the people and then tell them the Oireachtas could overrule their decision. It is, therefore, right to go to the people. The Taoiseach promised a referendum in 1997 and I commend him and the Government for not rushing because the approach they adopted to this difficult and complex issue was correct. Work on the Green Paper commenced in 1997 and concluded in December 1999. That was recognised by Professor Bonnar when he appeared before the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. He is one of the most eminent obstetricians and gynaecologists in the State. He has recently retired as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology in Trinity College, Dublin, after 25 years and is chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. He referred to the Green Paper as one of the most comprehensive documents he had ever seen in regard to legislation on abortion. The publication of the Green Paper was followed by the hearings of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which was very ably chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan who was ably assisted by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. They invited and received numerous written and oral submissions and interviewed many individuals and groups with particular expertise in the complex issues involved. This was followed by the work of the Cabinet sub-committee and the presentation of the legislation by the Minister for Health and Children. There is a legislative prohibition on abortion while at the same time best medical practice is preserved. I have no doubt people do not want a law which would compromise existing practice that is geared to protect both the mother and the child. The legislation meets that requirement. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution received numerous submissions from the medical profession, particularly members of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists who are the experts in the field of pregnancy. The institute stated in its submission: The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is the professional body representing the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland. The executive council of the institute [20]has examined the Green Paper on Abortion and the members have been consulted. We welcome the Green Paper, which provides a comprehensive, up-to-date and objective analysis of the issues arising in the care of the pregnant woman. Our expertise is in the medical area and our comments are confined to these aspects. In current obstetrical practice, rare complications can arise where therapeutic intervention is required at a stage in pregnancy when there will be little or no prospect for the survival of the baby due to extreme immaturity. In these exceptional situations, failure to intervene may result in the death of both mother and baby. We consider that there is a fundamental difference between abortion carried out with the intention of taking the life of the baby, for example, for social reasons, and the unavoidable death of the baby resulting from a central treatment to protect the life of the mother. We recognise our responsibility to provide after care for women who decide to leave the State for termination of pregnancy. We would recommend that full support and follow up services be made available for all women whose pregnancies have been terminated whatever the circumstances. The second paragraph is very important. When Professor Bonnar attended the committee he elaborated on the submission. He pointed out that the principle underlying the work of obstetricians and gynaecologists was to protect the lives of both the mother and child. He hoped they would never be compromised by the introduction of abortion in the sense that he would use, in other words, simply asking the obstetrician to intervene to get rid of unwanted pregnancies. That represents the view of the overwhelming majority of the people and the legislation is very much in line with that. The Bill brings more clarity to this complex issue than the 1992 legislation. Abortion is clearly defined as 'the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman'. The definition of abortion excludes medical procedures that are necessary to save the life of the mother. Many people are concerned and they are writing to Members on a daily basis about the protection of life before implantation. Article 40. 3.3. of the Constitution protects all human life and the proposal before us is not intended to address the wider concerns in the area of assisted human reproduction and issues such as stem cell research and cloning, which have serious consequences. The legislation is specifically concerned with protecting the life of the unborn during pregnancy. The issues involved in cloning, stem cell research and IVF are very difficult, complex matters and they are being addressed by the Government in the context of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, which was established by the Minister for Health and Children [21]in March 2000. This expert commission has been asked to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in the area. I have no doubt when it reports more legislation will be necessary because it is a complex area. I welcome the establishment of the crisis pregnancy agency. As a medical doctor who has worked in general practice, I am well aware of the trauma of unwanted pregnancy and I take Deputy Neville's point that crises can arise in a normal wanted pregnancy, although they are generally referred to the obstetrician who is competent to deal with these cases. The Minister, in establishing the crisis pregnancy agency, has recognised this problem which must be addressed in a caring way. There is a need for more education, advice and support during pregnancy for the women involved. Support services must also be provided for women who have had abortions abroad and these services must be delivered in a sensitive and compassionate manner. I am delighted that the Minister is providing €6. 5 million in 2002 for the agency. I have no doubt the agency will do a good job. I welcome the Bill and I will ask people to come out and support the proposal in the referendum.;3244340
1983;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Mr. John Gormley;Green Party;The most common reaction of many people to this issue is 'Not again'. It seems we have debated this issue ad nauseam for the past two decades or longer. It has scarred the national consciousness and left a legacy of bitterness and a gulf of misunderstanding. This legislation tries to bring together the divergent views, but in its attempt to be all things to all people, it ends up being nothing to anyone. For that reason the consensus so sought after by the Government will not occur and the referendum will most likely fail. My party allows each individual make up his or her mind on matters of conscience, as this matter clearly is. As it happens, both Green Party Deputies will be opposing the legislation on a number of grounds which I will outline. Last week I heard some speakers refer to this as a pro-life amendment or pro-life legislation. However, it is not. Many pro-life individuals have written to Members of the House expressing their sincere reservations about the legislation. They are correct as the legislation enshrines in law the notion that life begins at implantation and not at conception. Therefore, it clearly legalises the taking of unborn life in its very early stages. I am not a theological expert, but I believe this contravenes Catholic teaching and it is anathema to many in the pro-life movement who believe the morning after pill is morally wrong. The Government knows the morning after pill is widely and increasingly used in this country. It knows that if it was not used the number of abortions by Irish women in Britain would be far higher, and the Government has been forced to recognise this reality. It has been forced to recognise the reality that women require information and the right to travel and it has abandoned the core principle of [41]the pro-life movement that life begins at conception. The most pertinent legal and moral question which arises is that if it is acceptable to take unborn life by way of the morning after pill, why it is not acceptable to take unborn life by way of direct abortion. Surely this glaring inconsistency has not escaped the minds of those who worked on these proposals. The legislation is a political and moral fig leaf. It hopes to preserve our purity by bending morality. We can still technically say there is no abortion in Ireland, but that hides the sad reality. We are of the view that this proposed amendment to the Constitution will not address a number of fundamental questions. Will the referendum make the situation regarding abortion any clearer legally? After reviewing the proposals I must answer 'No'. If anything, it will make the legal situation worse. Will it help women who are suicidal, women who have been raped, or women who are victims of incest? Again, I do not believe it will. The Taoiseach has admitted that the referendum route we are being presented with is only constitutionally necessary to overthrow the Supreme Court decision in the X case and that it is not necessary for implementing any of the other aspects, which can be implemented through legislation. Therefore, we continue to legalise the abortion trail to Britain so we can feel good about ourselves. We are now being subjected to what in all probability will be a divisive and painful abortion referendum, necessitated solely by the Government's insistence on reversing the Supreme Court's ruling on suicide and abortion. If this referendum is passed a suicidal woman who chooses abortion will be criminalised, and we find this totally inhumane and unacceptable. The referendum will create a great deal of wealth for lawyers, but many headaches for the rest of us. It is a legal mess. Before it was out of the stalls, reports of the legal time bombs being lobbed at voters were surfacing in the media, with quotes from constitutional and legal experts. The very process of introducing such a Bill, amending the Constitution in such a manner, and appending an Act to the Constitution as a Schedule, is quite extraordinary. It will mean it will not be possible to amend the legislation at a later stage in the Dáil, even though the courts could technically interpret the legislation in a manner which was not intended by ourselves or those who vote in the referendum. We would have to return to the people with yet another abortion referendum to untie any complications which might arise from the bad drafting of the current proposal. Powers are given to the Minister to determine what evidence will be necessary to ascertain whether a medical procedure or an abortion has been carried out, and he or she will have similar powers when it comes to determining the approved places where such medical procedures may be carried out. This will be done by ministerial order, and we know how little scrutiny such [42]orders receive in the House. Nobody knows whether one hospital will be designated an approved place or whether it will extend to every doctor's surgery. The definitions are either non-existent or so broad as to invite multiple interpretations. I have already referred to the problems concerning an approved place. 'Medical procedure', although it is cited as being different from abortion, which is illegal, is never defined. 'Woman', we are helpfully told, means a female person. The definition of medical practitioner is so broad that it would allow any of us, God forbid, to set up a practice and perform medical procedures under the guidelines in the legislation. Who knows, the responsible Minister might deem Dáil Éireann an approved place. The legislation does not state that a medical practitioner must be registered with the general registrar of medical practitioners or anyone else. Irish law does not properly prohibit unregistered people from practising medicine. The Taoiseach has already admitted in his responses to Deputy Noonan that a legal challenge is also possible under Article 40. 3.3 to prevent suspected abortifacients and that the society for the Protection of the Unborn Child is now pursuing a legal case in the United Kingdom to have the morning after pill banned. There are a number of other instances of lack of clarity in this proposed referendum. The last one I wish to highlight at this stage is the 17th protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and how it will sit if this referendum is approved. The 17th protocol inserted by the Fianna Fáil-PD Government stated that nothing in the treaty of the European Union shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40. 3.3 of the Constitution of Ireland. Article 40. 3.3 states: The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. With this referendum we are inserting Article 40. 3.4 and Article 40. 3.5. I know the Taoiseach has stated that this envisaged legislation will have no EU law implications. I also know the Government has changed its version on this issue at least three times in the Dáil. On 9 October, for instance, the Taoiseach stated that to change the Maastricht Protocol was probably not necessary. What then is the situation? There are questions hanging over this issue in regard to the EU. There is the issue of a fundamental charter or constitution being drawn up by the European Union there is also the issue of the EU incorporating the EU convention on human rights. I understand some of the case law built around the convention stresses the right to life of the mother as against the foetus. It stands to reason that a protocol that cites a particular Article of the Constitution only applies to that particular section. What will the Government do [43]about this? If we are to believe the Government in regard to the changing of the Nice Treaty, it appears that it is impossible for any protocols to be added to that treaty. We are told that it is impossible for the Nice Treaty to be changed one iota. Many of the groups who campaigned against the Nice Treaty have been seeking to have a protocol attached exempting Ireland from any involvement in European Union militarisation and in the EU Rapid Reaction Force. If it is confirmed that the Maastricht Protocol will not extend to these issues addressed in the forthcoming abortion referendum, what will the Government do? I am intrigued by one of the Taoiseach's suggestions. On 9 October in the Dáil the Taoiseach stated that if a change was necessary this would not create a difficulty with member states because on a whole range of issues protocols are regularly nodded through at European Council level. I found this to be an extraordinary statement. If an abortion change can be nodded through, why can a change in Ireland's involvement in EU defence not be nodded through, as the Taoiseach puts it? Perhaps we could nod through both of them at the same time. The Taoiseach's analysis of this issue is totally woolly. It seems that the Government will have to wait for the next EU treaty to be drafted before any new protocols can be inserted. This will leave the legal status of the Maastrich Protocol in limbo until the next EU treaty is negotiated, in other words, for several years. This is quite a mess. The removal of the suicide clause is the only reason for the Government calling a referendum on this issue. The people already decided by way of referendum in 1992 to retain this protection but now the Government is asking them to look at it again. The Taoiseach's response to the issue of what to do when a pregnant woman is suicidal is to export that woman and her problem to another jurisdiction. What that means is that appropriate medical treatment as determined by medical doctors is not being given in this country to our citizens. It means that psychiatrists' opinions are not seen as valid. It implies that mental illness is not a real illness and that it cannot be life threatening. I understand the incidence of suicide in pregnancy is rare, as Deputy Lenihan said. However, the Supreme Court X case decision has been with us for a decade and there has been no upsurge of abortion cases citing suicide. All the more reason to wonder why are we having a referendum to deal with these rare instances. Why are we removing this small but important protection for women's lives? Like many people, I feel distinctly uncomfortable with the idea of abortion. Anyone who has attended a maternity hospital, witnessed an ultra sound scan and seen the womb will find the idea of abortion quite distasteful. We have a duty as legislators to face up to the reality. It is a terrible and sad reality but face it we must. I do not believe this legislation is doing so, therefore, we [44]will be supporting the Fine Gael amendment and opposing the legislation.;3244341
1984;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protectio;14.11.01;M;Mr. John O'Donoghue;Fianna Fáil;I am grateful for the opportunity to welcome and discuss the Government's [26]package of proposals for constitutional and legislative reform in relation to the protection of human life in pregnancy. The issues we are discussing are complex and sensitive. They relate to the protection of unborn human life and ensuring that pregnant women continue to have access to all necessary medical treatment where such treatment becomes necessary in the course of pregnancy. I regard this issue as one which deserves to be lifted above the level of the cut and thrust of party political debate. The issue is too sensitive for that type of treatment but it is an issue which demands to be resolved. I firmly believe the Government's proposals strike the right balance, delivering constitutional, legislative, caring intervention in the area of crisis pregnancy. I wholeheartedly agree with the view expressed by the Taoiseach that doing nothing is not an option. The reality is that previous attempts to reconcile the rights of the mother and the unborn child were rejected by the people in the 1992 referendum. At present, the only real defence against widespread use of the X case as a basis for social abortion in Ireland is the ethical consensus in the medical profession. The express terms of the 1983 amendment to the Constitution demand a legislative response from the Oireachtas. However, no laws were enacted on foot of that amendment. The proposals currently before us represent the Government taking its role as legislators seriously. It is fair to say the outcome of the various referenda left a widespread feeling of unfinished business among the people. This places a heavy onus on us as legislators to provide the leadership necessary to underpin the issue of the protection of human life in pregnancy. The Taoiseach's stated position in the 1997 general election was that a key element in establishing a national consensus and in creating a workable legal basis for protecting the lives of both women and the unborn is to give the people a direct say in resolving that unfinished business. Once in Government, we set up an interdepartmental working group whose findings were considered by a Cabinet sub-committee, chaired by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. This led to the publication of a Green Paper in September 1999 which was subsequently referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and the committee's vice-chairman, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for their work on and commitment to this project. The proceedings of the all-party committee and its subsequent report were generally fair, balanced and of great value in educating and informing public and political opinion. Certainly, as far as the Cabinet sub-committee, subsequently re-formed following publication of the all-party committee's report in November 2000, and on which I have the honour of serving, was [27]concerned, that report and the preceding process of consultation and inquiry was of immense value. The Cabinet sub-committee was given the task of considering options and preparing proposals for consideration. I can truthfully say this process was not easy but I believe we discharged our onerous responsibility with sensitivity and frankness. That process brought the sub-committee to this stage. The Government has concluded that no simple sentence or paragraph can be inserted into the Constitution which, by itself, would amount to a balanced, effective, legal response to the complex medical and legal issues surrounding the protection of human life in pregnancy. Having carefully reviewed all of the information and advice available, there cannot be any doubt that the proper place to strike that complex balance is in legislation passed by the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution. I have no doubt the proposals before us in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill are the first legislative response to the issues raised by the 1983 amendment to the Constitution and the X case. It is clear that this is no knee-jerk or sloppy response to an issue which causes much pain and suffering. It is a measured and calculated response developed only after much deliberation. It is worth restating what the Government has decided to do. We will put an amendment to the people which will result in two new subsections being added to Article 40. 3 of the Constitution which will give constitutional protection from the adoption by the Oireachtas of a legislative approach, thereby guaranteeing that the terms of the legislation will be seen and approved in advance by the people and provide that any future legislative amendment must be approved by the people before being signed into law by the President. This approach, modelled on that used successfully in regard to the Good Friday Agreement, puts this issue where it belongs – on a legislative basis and in the hands of the Irish people. The constitutional changes being sought ensure the legislation has a sound constitutional basis and that the balance so carefully struck will not be threatened by a legal challenge from any source. It also gives the people the assurance that they must be consulted in the event of further proposed change. While we are addressing the complex issues surrounding the protection of unborn human life, we wish to ensure at the same time that pregnant women continue to have access to all necessary medical treatment if problems arise in the course of their pregnancies. A key element of the proposal is that the amendment will occur only if the Oireachtas enacts the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act in the precise terms published as a schedule to the Bill within six months. This is only right and proper as it is imperative the Irish people know exactly what they are voting for. The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Consti[28]tution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 is in line with the third option outlined in the report of the all-party committee. For the first time, the Bill protects women and the unborn in pregnancy. It accommodates existing medical practice which safeguards the life of a woman from exposure to real and substantial risk. It gives complete protection to the medical procedures necessary to avoid those risks and excludes them in the definition of abortion. The House will be aware that in a small number of cases of strict and undeniable medical necessity, procedures can entail or result in the ending of the life of the unborn. However, the new law defines abortion in a way which clearly excludes such ethically legitimate procedures from being termed an abortion under our criminal law. I remain convinced that in terms of the balance we know is so necessary, the measures protect the life of the unborn in the strongest possible way and most definitely do not provide for social abortion. The late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy stated in 1992: In the context of the eight years that have passed since the amendment [the 1983 pro-life amendment], the failure by the Legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate, it is inexcusable. Nine years on, that statement has achieved an even greater force. That is why the Government has resolved to face up to the issue once and for all and to create the proper context in which an appropriate legislative response can be placed on the Statute Book. It creates the framework within which we, as legislators, can exercise our responsibility in the name of the people and with their express endorsement. This issue is sufficiently important for us to adopt this strategy. I readily acknowledge that the issue of suicide is a difficult one for many people. The Bill provides that the risk of suicide will no longer be a ground for legal abortion in this State. The Government believes the conclusions of the report of the all-party committee do not support maintenance of the suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland, a view with which I fully concur. It should be noted that suicide risk has been advanced only as a ground for abortion in cases in which the State, directly or indirectly, attempted to restrict a woman's freedom to travel. The terms of the new law will protect that freedom and will not compromise it in any way. I make no apology for stating my opposition to so-called social abortion. I do not support this so-called right and would not be standing here today in support of the Government's proposals if we were legislating for such an outcome. I believe the Irish people are implacably opposed to social abortion and I am glad to say the Government shares that opposition. I am aware that not every viewpoint or interest group will be entirely satisfied with every detail of the package being presented by the Government. If they were, this [29]issue would have been resolved long ago. However, the Government has achieved a package of measures which can command sufficient broad-based consensus to be workable and which recognises the rights of the unborn child and the pregnant woman. It is a reasonable and measured response capable of resolving an issue which has exercised our minds for so long. The Government's proposals are innovative in that they adopt a holistic approach, concentrating not just on legal-constitutional issues but also on caring and practical intervention in the area of crisis pregnancy. A study commissioned by the Department of Health and Children entitled Women and Crisis Pregnancy gave some useful insights into the factors leading to crisis pregnancy and the experiences of women in that situation. Furthermore, the all-party committee identified a range of issues to be addressed in any strategy to combat crisis pregnancy. It recognised that several Departments, State bodies and voluntary organisations have responsibilities in this area and that a single planning focus was required to ensure successful intervention with women attempting to deal with crisis pregnancies. Law is only one element of the picture education, advice, care and compassion are in many ways equally important. That is why the establishment of the new crisis pregnancy agency by the Minister for Health and Children is a crucial element in the Government's strategy to deal with this important issue. The crisis pregnancy agency will draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy, to promote options other than abortion and to provide for post-abortion services. The agency will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the strategy. It is incumbent on us to do all we can to mobilise the resources of the State to assist women who have to decide whether to proceed with a pregnancy. Crisis pregnancies result in a significant number of Irish women travelling abroad for abortions. The State must use all its means to strive honestly and fairly to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy. Those who face such problems must be assisted to become aware of their options other than abortion. We should enable them to consider carefully such options and assist them to make decisions. The new crisis pregnancy agency will deal with many issues, including those I have outlined. Crucially, preventative measures, including the education of young people and adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles, will be addressed by the agency. It will work with a wide range of organisations, in the health, education, employment and housing sectors. I am glad the agency will promote prevention. The all-party committee recommended that the agency be established for ten years initially and this has been done. Initial funding of €6. 5 million will be provided for the agency by the Government in 2002. The package of measures that has been proposed should lead to a reduction in the incidence of crisis pregnancies and will give the widest poss[30]ible assistance to women facing such difficulties. I reject the inferences made inside and outside the House that the Government's proposals are, at best, inadequate and, at worst, misogynistic. The issue of suicide has been used to attack the Government's proposals, but no reasonable or workable alternative to the balanced constitutional and legislative framework that is at the heart of the Government's caring strategy has been suggested. The evidence, analysis and conclusions presented in the all-party committee's report do not support allowing the risk of suicide to be given as a ground for abortion. The conclusion of the committee members is backed by the testimony of psychiatrists, whose testimony did not support the thesis of the termination of pregnancy as a means of alleviating the threat of suicide. Abortion is one of the most difficult issues with which a woman can be faced, privately and publicly. We should not run away from it because it is a difficult issue. As male and female legislators, it is our duty to address the painful and difficult issues that abortion raises. The proposals to be put to the people represent a fair reflection of the belief that abortion should not be permitted in this country. The medical procedures required to protect the lives of pregnant women need to be safeguarded. I have made no secret of the fact that I support the right to life of the unborn child and am opposed to abortion on demand. The Government's proposals offer strong protection to the unborn and ensure abortion on demand will not be available. I welcome this Bill's protection of the life of pregnant women and its introduction of the necessary supports to deal with crisis pregnancies. Debate on this topic will never be easy, but we must debate it. I firmly hope that as the debate moves from this House, it will be conducted in a tolerant atmosphere, without acrimony or bitterness. We must accept that there are strongly held views on abortion. We do not have to endure intolerance, personal vilification or scaremongering on either side of the argument.;3244342

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;The Government's definition is an odd one. This oddity is explained in the press statements by the Government when the proposals were announced. The Government justifies it in an attempt to save the use of IUDs and the morning after pill from legal challenge. As a result of events yesterday, this exercise may have been unnecessary. Yesterday the Irish Medicines Board took decisions that will result in approval of the sale of Levonelle, a type of morning after pill. According to a spokesperson for the IMB the decision was made 'in consultation with' the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecolgists and a senior counsel who examined the matter for the board. The IMB refused to sanction this product about six months ago, but has done so now on the grounds that it is a contraceptive rather that an abortifacient. The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecolgists seems to have no ethical problem with this decision. The institute advised the IMB that it was appropriate to sanction this in due course for sale in Ireland. The eminent legal counsel retained by the IMB is of the view that the use of Levonelle is in accordance with Article 40. 3.3 of the Constitution. Why, therefore, does the Government believe that it needs to include a non-medical and decidedly odd definition of abortion in this Bill to save the use of the morning after pill when it is under no threat from either the medical profession or legal opinion? There are, of course, chemical abortifacients which act after implantation. It is possible to envisage a case being stated which would go all the way to the Supreme Court on the use of these products, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty how a Supreme Court might decide on whether such products acting in or around or shortly after the time of implantation would be legal in this jurisdiction. This shows the level of uncertainty that emerges when one examines these proposals. [111]The proposed Bill will allow a medical practitioner to terminate a pregnancy if he forms 'a reasonable opinion' that the termination is necessary to 'prevent a real and substantial risk of the loss of a woman's life other than by self destruction.' If a medical practitioner were to terminate a pregnancy for any other reason, he would be liable to the criminal penalties under the Bill. It is not the criminal sanctions, however, which will primarily regulate the grounds on which terminations will be carried out by medical practitioners, it is the ethical code of the Medical Council which will regulate this in practice. Medical practitioners who transgress this code may be removed from the medical register. We know of examples where they have been so removed. I have the highest respect for the medical profession and its code of practice. It has served us well in both medical and ethical matters. We know, however, from divisions within the council earlier this year that its code of practice may change. It has changed in the last 12 months and could change again in the future. This adds a further uncertainty to the proposal, because the grounds for termination are founded on a code of practice which may change and without reference to the Oireachtas or the people. It can be done internally within the Medical Council. The X case has become central to this debate. I have reread the judgments in the case and the House may be interested to note that, at least, one Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice McCarthy, suggested that the real and substantial risk to the life of a mother which would permit termination of pregnancy under Article 40. 3.3 need not be an immediate risk. Mr. Justice Hamilton, the Chief Justice, had a different view. He said the risk had to be immediate, but Mr. Justice McCarthy stated clearly that it need not be. If a medical practitioner on the enactment of this legislation were to form a reasonable opinion that a risk to the life of a mother was real and substantial, though not immediate, could not a future Supreme Court uphold that decision and would not this provide for abortion on a much wider basis than envisaged by the Government or anyone else in this House? I do not exaggerate the position when I say that what one Supreme Court judge might state in a judgment in one set of circumstances could easily become the majority view in another set of circumstances in a subsequent Supreme Court decision by the same or different individuals. It is this kind of unforeseen circumstance leading to a decision of the Supreme Court which has caused difficulty in the past. This is what happened in the X case, to the surprise of the strong supporters of the amendment of 1983. It is not a sentence or a phrase, but a whole Bill that is now being grafted on to the Constitution, and the grounds on which the Supreme Court can adjudicate have been significantly widened and increased. I defy any Minister to state [112]with certainty what the consequences of this in all circumstances may be. Deputy Gay Mitchell who is taking this debate on behalf of Fine Gael has argued very strongly that the powers vested in Ministers to change the manner in which the Bill operates create further uncertainty. Places where terminations may take place may be designated from time to time and the obligation to keep records may be altered by ministerial order. I agree with what he says and have nothing to add. However, taken with all the other uncertainties and ambiguities, this is another serious flaw in the proposal. A Minister may change the circumstances in which terminations may take place, but if the House seeks to amend the legislation, even if a technical flaw is discovered, it must go to the people. I cannot summarise the ambiguities behind the Bill any better than to quote the Taoiseach's reply to some of my questions: It is not the Government's intention to resolve the ongoing ethical debate as to whether procedures referred to in section 1(2) of the envisaged legislation amount to legal abortion or to termination. It is not the Government's intention to define what the term 'unborn' means in the Constitution. It is not the Government's intention to define the point at which a 'distinct human person comes into existence.' The Taoiseach rightly says that all these issues are the subject of philosophical, moral and theological discourse, but they are not only the subject of such discourse, they are also the subject of legal discourse and central to what a Supreme Court in the future will or may decide. It is not possible to predict now how it may deal with these issues. The ambiguities, doubts and grey areas will cause us as much difficulty, emotional conflict and anxiety in the future as was caused by the X case and the C case. In presenting the Government's proposal the Taoiseach made much of the fact that this was, yet again, an attempt to deal with the consequences of the Supreme Court judgment in the X case. I appreciate fully the legal implications of that judgment, but it is important to bring a sense of reality to bear on the situation. In the nine years since the Supreme Court case the one thing that can be said with certainty is that the prediction that the X case would open the floodgates to abortion was incorrect. The X case was followed by the C case, there may have been others, but if there were, I have not heard of them. In dealing with the ambiguity of these proposals the Government has resolutely faced in both directions as to whether the proposal brought forward is reconcilable with Protocol 17 of the Maastricht treaty. The protocol provides: 'Nothing in the Treaty of the European Union, nor in the treaties establishing the European Communities or the treaties or Acts modifying or supplementing these treaties, shall effect the application in Ireland of Article 40. 3.3º of the [113]Constitution of Ireland.' Clearly, the protocol does not restrict Ireland's power unilaterally to amend Article 40. 3.3º, but that is not my point. However, in the third edition of The Irish Constitution by J. M. Kelly, Gerard Hogan points out: 'It is by no means clear that such unilateral amendment would automatically obtain the benefit of the immunity from EC law provided by the protocol as it is arguable that the reference to Article 40. 3.3º in the protocol is a reference to that provision as it stood on 7 February 1992, the date on which the treaty on the European Union was signed.' It is easy to envisage a conflict emerging between European and Irish law in this area. We know that abortion has been defined as a service under Article 60 of the treaty. What would be the situation if an effort is made to prosecute a person selling the contraceptive RU486 from outside this jurisdiction to consumers within this jurisdiction? I use the word 'consumer' not to make light of the issue, but because it has been defined as a service and that is the parlance in which it will be dealt with in Europe. Is this form of contraception intended to be banned or not under the legislation and if it is to be banned, how will the Government ensure such cross-border sales within the European Union can be effectively prohibited? I do not know if the House is aware, but I understand it is possible to access points of sale of contraceptive RU486 on the Internet and to purchase such chemical contraceptives with a credit card. Does the Government intend to take steps to prohibit the importation of contraceptive RU486 when this Bill is enacted? If it does, has it worked out its defence to a challenge, which could go as far as the European Court of Justice? I do not know what is the Government's intention, but this illustrates the point that it has not clarified the inter-relationship between its proposal and the protocol to the Maastricht treaty. This adds further uncertainty to the proposal. I spare the Taoiseach the question of what precisely is the state of European law in relation to fundamental rights which may emerge in the introduction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, now the subject matter of discussion. How would effect be given to rights to life, to health and protection to the rights of mothers and children by the European Court of Justice in the context of a more general human rights jurisdiction? Perhaps the Taoiseach will address this aspect in due course. If a differentiation is being made between conception and implantation, a series of issues arise in relation to IVF treatment and embryo and stem cell research. If, on the one hand, the Government maintains that Article 40. 3.3º still protects human life from conception, that gives rise to one set of circumstances, but if, on the other, the protection is only going to be vindicated from implantation, we have another set of circumstances, which, in terms of IVF treatment, [114]embryo and stem cell research, will put existing practice on its head. Ultimately, we could have a far more unsatisfactory situation than the one we have today. There will be greater uncertainty and ambiguity. Fine Gael is trying to deal with this issue reasonably and moderately because we do not want division. We are asking the Government to give itself more time – another three months – to resolve the difficulties which have been brought to its attention, including by many whom the Government expected to support the referendum. I have outlined the main ambiguities and drawn attention to possible uncertain and unforeseeable consequences, whether coming from the courts, the Medical Council or the European Union. We have much experience on this issue and know the traps and dangers of ambiguity and unforeseen consequences. The Minister should accept the reasoned amendment by the Fine Gael Party when this reading is put to a vote, either tonight or next week. The Government should give itself the time to resolve the issue. If it intends to return to the House with a fuller proposal, it should, at least, give itself time to remove the uncertainties, ambiguities and unforeseen circumstances obvious to those who analyse and think about it for any reasonable length of time.;3244558

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;M;Mr. Andrew Boylan;Fine Gael;I was making a point about sexual abuse of girls, boys and women. The sentence handed down in a case which came to light in this city involving a student and visitor has appalled people. There is no deterrent and this type of activity must be stamped out. Young girls and boys, and people in general, must feel safe going out to socialise. The recent two year sentence is an insult to those who suffered as a result of this crime. I question the mindset of the Judiciary when dealing with these people. The minimum sentence should be ten years with no time off for good behaviour but time added on for bad behaviour. It is important that people feel free. We have a wonderful society and a booming economy. People have more disposable income and wish to enjoy themselves as, of course, they are entitled to do and, in that context, any form of abuse is not acceptable. It is important that there is support for women who find themselves pregnant and have a difficulty. If there is adequate back-up support, many women in crisis pregnancies might not seek abortion. I believe it is wrong and an element of guilt follows, with which people have to live. If such women or girls were encouraged to continue the pregnancy to full term and found they were not in a position to rear the baby, there are many families who are not blessed with children and who would be glad to adopt that child and provide a good home for him or her. Other families may wish to foster a child. Such arrangements could be made more widely if appropriate support services were available. In the past, babies born outside of marriage were often given up for adoption, without the mother knowing the subsequent whereabouts of her baby. Children placed in those circumstances subsequently spent their adult years trying to find their real parents. That information should be freely available to them. Why the secrecy? If the mother wanted secrecy, one must also have regard to the feelings of the child or, in due course, the young adult. I know of a young man who had been adopted as a child and only discovered when he grew up that he had a sister, whom he spent many years trying to find. There was a wonderful reunion when they eventually met. The people concerned should have ready access to information to enable them to trace their blood relations. I can understand the position of a mother who feels she has to give up her child for adoption but I do not accept that she can deny the child the right to identify her or any other children she may have. I have no difficulty with the wording of the amendment, as such, but I am concerned that the background to it is not as clear-cut as it might be. People who have spoken and written to me have raised difficulties as to when life begins. The Government has a responsibility to such people to clarify that issue. I grew up with the belief that life begins at conception but there seems to be another school of thought, which I find unacceptable. For that reason, my party takes the view that we should hasten slowly, rather than rushing into this referendum. The debate in this House has been of a very [87]high standard and I have no difficulty with the genuine concerns which were reflected in the contributions to the debate from all sides of the House. Out in the public arena, there is a discussion, rather than a debate, in progress. Perhaps we now have a more open society and people are more balanced in their approach. It is important that people are very clear on the issues involved and I hope we will come to a conclusion which will be acceptable to the majority of people.;3244560
1990;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;M;Dr. Tom Moffatt;Fianna Fáil;I wish to make a few comments on this Bill. So far, the comments on all sides of the House have been constructive, without any gross exaggeration or rancour, compared with what took place in previous debates on this issue in 1983 and 1992. The issue has been debated, on and off, over the past 20 years, thus indicating that we have not resolved the issue of abortion as yet. The current Bill approaches the issue on three different levels – constitutional, legislative and caring, or practical aspects. No legislation or constitutional changes, per se, will resolve the sensitive issue of abortion. Much anxiety has arisen since the 1992 X case which, in the opinion of many people, did not represent best practice in regard to psychiatric care of a pregnant person. All this evolved on account of the suicide issue, which has been the subject of some excellent contributions to this debate, particularly by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Dr. O'Hanlon. He cited a great deal of relevant information in regard to suicide in pregnancy. The Irish College of Psychiatrists is of the opinion that suicide is not a major threat in pregnancy and that pregnancy even protects against the very aspect of suicide. Psychiatrists in the UK and worldwide have also come to the same conclusion. Dr. O'Hanlon cited several references in that regard. It is an easy option, in regard to the threat of suicide, to invoke abortion but the correct approach should be to treat the person who has suicidal thoughts. That is the way forward in terms of best practice in regard to psychiatric care. Undoubtedly, there has been a huge increase in abortion rates, as evidenced by the figures we have from the UK and this demands a new approach on our part. As the Taoiseach has said, we do not have the option of doing nothing – we must deal with the issue. Obstetricians and gynaecologists are unsure of the legal position that pertains in many emergency situations, in regard to the health and well-being of the pregnant patient. The indemnity situation has gone out of hand, particularly for obstetricians and gynaecologists, some of whom are paying £60,000 to £100,000 per annum for indemnity cover in relation to their practices. The proposed legislation sets out an acceptable position with regard to the rights of the mother and the unborn, with no fear or ambiguity regarding the preservation of the life of the mother in certain critical situations, especially from the obstetrical point of view. The College of Obstetricians [88]and Gynaecologists has said it accepts, in general, the views expressed in this Bill. The definition of abortion is a pragmatic one, which will allow the use of the morning after pill and the intrauterine contraceptive device. This is a very important advance, particularly when facing cases of rape, incest and, especially, uncertainty about the possibility of lapses of mature sexual behaviour. The advent of the crisis pregnancy agency is a very positive step. I know both sides of the House are claiming credit for this, but it does not matter who initiated this. Even though some people have criticised the fact that not enough money has been given to it and that the amount only represents £1,000 per person that might travel to the UK for an abortion. However, it is a move in the right direction. It is an area that has much potential, especially in the preventative aspects of abortion. It will lead to better education, better care and will look at the problem in a very sympathetic way. We have the possibility of better counselling, proper medical care and above all it gives rise to the possibility of genetic testing for people who are at risk of abnormalities, whether physical or metabolic in nature. All these issues can be dealt with under this umbrella. This is the most important part that has been introduced to date. Some people have suggested that we have not moved forward from the position in 1983 or 1992. However, even if we move forward with the crisis pregnancy agency, it will be something to our credit. Society in general has changed in the recent years. We have become more tolerant in our attitudes and this is for the better. Yet, that is not to say that deliberate induced abortion is ever right. Medical ethics demand primum non nocere: whatever we do we must not cause any damage or hurt. There is no place in obstetrical practice to do wrong to a woman or her unborn child. The fact that other jurisdictions may have lower standards or look at these issues in a different way, perhaps in the guise that they may be more humane does not augur well for that society which forgets the right to life of both the mother and the child. That is not to say we can afford to be too judgmental on these issues. Neither does it demand that we should provide the right to choose scenario that many have put forward. This would then be more argumentum ad hominem and would not be a real argument to the issue of abortion per se. Mothers have the right to information and to travel. This might suggest that we are hypocritical, anti-woman, and two-faced and that we are running away from the issues and not facing up to our obligations. However this is not so. We can only lay down the law with regard to our own jurisdiction. What is done in other jurisdictions is not really our business. As legislators, we have no right to ask obstetricians, gynaecologists, midwives, anaesthetists and others in this country to do something inherently wrong in itself. We have a problem and people say we should not export it. However, the measures incorporated in this Bill will help to address some of the [89]issues that surround abortion. We have come a long way since 1983 and 1992 with the right to information, the right to travel, the morning after pill and the intrauterine device. Even though it is disputed at the moment, the definition of abortion is more pragmatic. The crisis pregnancy agency, to which I already referred, has great potential. There are major attitudinal changes, which have taken place since 1983 and 1992 when this was previously discussed. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has played a major part in assisting people in devastating conditions with social problems. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has also played its part with regard to housing for individuals who find themselves in difficult circumstances. We are looking at disabilities in a different mode and we are coming around to addressing these issues in a more pragmatic manner. The Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science have also moved along during that time. We have a better society with regard to how we treat sensitive issues like abortion. We still have difficulties and they will remain. Developments in human reproduction will give people better control over such matters in the future, without having to resort to abortion as the answer for unexpected hard cases. The Bill represents the best effort of Government to tackle the problem of abortion and its many faceted complications in a caring and pragmatic manner. I hope the people will support the referendum when it comes about. It is a very difficult matter to deal with and the best efforts of Governments previously have not succeeded in getting it off the agenda. Nevertheless, what is proposed in this Bill is a genuine effort by the Government to move forward and give practical help by way of treating the whole issue. The crisis pregnancy agency will prove to be very successful. If it prevents a number of people from having abortions, then it will have been a success. Constitutional change per se will not prevent abortion, but what is in this Bill will help to a certain extent. At the same time we are not being too judgmental with mothers who have to take the road to abortion in another jurisdiction. I hope we will provide for them and everybody in a pragmatic and caring fashion.;3244561
1991;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;M;Mr. Pádraic McCormack;Fine Gael;Like Deputy Moffatt, I am pleased we are having a very rational debate on the abortion issue now. I am privileged to follow Deputy Moffatt and you a Leas Cheann Comhairle, both eminent doctors and to be joined in the Chamber by Deputy Michael Higgins. We are now on the Second Stage of the Bill and Members are getting an opportunity to put their concerns and views on the record. To some extent, this is opening up a debate on the proposed legislation. That may serve some purpose in developing a debate outside the House. However, I am surprised at the lack of real debate on this subject, outside the House at this time, despite the fact that people have had the opportunity to study the proposals. I have had very little communication, contact [90]or correspondence from my constituents on the matter. This could mean one of three things. It could mean the public is satisfied with the proposals. It could mean the public has very little interest in the proposals, or it could mean the public is waiting for the referendum to give its verdict. In other words are they waiting in the long grass? I do not know the answer to that, but there is a great silence out there. Over the past two years, like other Deputies, I have received about 200 items of correspondence about this issue. This was mainly from people advocating a referendum to ensure constitutional protection for the life of the unborn and I have had some other correspondence on the matter. Since the Government proposals were announced, we in Fine Gael have studied them seriously and have looked at the problem seriously. Our spokesman prepared a 20-page response seeking clarification on about 30 aspects of the Government's proposals. It is the duty of an opposition to question. We are not here to rubber stamp everything the Government comes up with. We have to examine it and question it and sometimes people do not understand that. We received a reply to our question from the Taoiseach's office which we accepted as a serious attempt to deal with our concerns, but were far from satisfied. We tabled an amendment asking that we do not proceed with the Committee Stage for a period of three months so as to get further clarification of the Bill's legal and other aspects which are causing us concern. I will support that reasonable amendment when it is put to the House at the end of this debate. About 200 people contacted me on this matter in the past two years and, despite my communicating with all of them to seek their views on this Bill, only six responded and their reactions were mixed. They ranged from complete rejection of the Government's proposals in the belief that they will make matters worse, to seeing them as going some way towards protecting the life of the unborn. I cannot analyse why people are holding their counsel. Many speakers dealt with the rights of the mother and rightly so. These are adequately dealt with, but the proposals also deal with the right to life of the unborn. The principal proposal attempts to deal with the court ruling in the X case. The removal of the suicide clause is the only reason for this referendum, but the people already decided in the 1992 referendum to retain this constitutional protection, which was then overruled by the Supreme Court. Some people, in the House and outside, interpret this simply and say that there are only two options if a threat of suicide exists – the woman can commit suicide or travel to England for an abortion. A third option is to give the pregnant woman the support to carry her pregnancy to full term which is important. It can save both the life of the mother, which Dr. O'Hanlon dealt with earlier, and that of the child. Such support in the first instance comes from family and friends. Many in this House have given that support and would do so again if faced with the challenge. There should also be State support. Will the proposed refer[91]endum assist the estimated 6,000 women who go annually to Britain for abortions? The answer is that it will not. Deputy Gay Mitchell, the Fine Gael spokesman on health, produced a private Member's Bill to assist mothers with crisis pregnancies. Dr. Moffat stated that it has Government support. We do not mind who takes credit for it as it was a genuine move by Fine Gael to address the issue of support for women in these circumstances. Women who experience crisis pregnancies need State support. For too long the State failed to establish proper support structures leaving the work to excellent but over stretched and under resourced voluntary organisations. Fine Gael proposes the establishment of such support through a care of the persons board which would support and facilitate any expectant mother experiencing a crisis pregnancy to bring it to full term. We have a tendency to seek comprehensive solutions to problems and to take no action until we have the magic formula. Much of the debate is for or against a further constitutional amendment. Fine Gael played its part in the All-party Committee on the Constitution in relation to abortion. It was Fine Gael's input which resulted in the recommendation of a body to support women in crisis pregnancy and unborn children. Whatever the Government's final proposals on abortion are, we still need those support structures. Since the X case a decade ago, too much time was lost instead of establishing these support structures. As a matter of policy, our parliamentary party endorsed the creation of such a body. No one knows the exact number of Irish women who obtain abortions outside the State, but clearly a significant number do. The media report it at 6,000 while statistics supplied to the Oireachtas committee by the office of national statistics for England and Wales show that in 1971, 578 women normally resident in the Republic had abortions and in 1999, it was estimated at 6,226. Some reports view these as under estimates. We have a responsibility to enact legislation to give whatever support we can to avoid these abortions. Our Bill contains provisions for a board which should consist of 12 members, with a three year term of office, appointed by the Minister for Health and Children subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann. The Minister shall appoint a chairperson from among its members and the chairman shall at least annually, and when required by the Oireachtas committee appointed by both Houses for that purpose, appear before such a committee to account for the discharge of the board's responsibilities. Its role shall be to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any expectant mother resident in Ireland shall receive every necessary support, including advice, financial support, accommodation and health care to ensure that every assistance is available during a crisis pregnancy. These are practical steps that our party wants to take and I am sure other parties will support them. The board's role shall be to support, [92]encourage and facilitate any expectant mother to bring her pregnancy to full term. We provide that this should include giving every reasonable assistance to a mother and child or children after the birth of a child or children. Support should also be extended to the expectant mother's family members or other persons connected with her at the board's discretion. Support or assistance from the board shall require the expectant mother's consent. We are not above having these proposals improved or amended by any Government. Section 7 of our Bill provides that the board may by itself, or with the representative of particular groups or organisations that it considers appropriate, establish schemes to protect and support the expectant mother and her unborn child or children. The board shall have a chief executive who shall account to the Committee of Public Accounts in the normal way for moneys under the board's care. We make such a proposal because we expect the board to be generously funded but it must keep its staffing requirements and overheads to what is absolutely necessary to ensure maximum resources are made available to mothers in a crisis pregnancy. Our proposal is to provide £50 million for this board over a ten year period. If £5 million per year does not meet the requirements then it can be reviewed by the Oireachtas committee to which the board will report. Fine Gael is committed to social justice. We are trying to bring about a real and practical contribution to addressing this serious problem. We believe the creation of the board as provided for in the Bill we have published will be a real and positive step towards caring for women with crisis pregnancies and their families. Those are practical steps that can be taken. It is not simplistic to say the Government proposal condemns a woman in a crisis pregnancy to suicide or to go abroad for an abortion. There is a third option. We must all play our part in supporting, as far as practically possible, that third option, whether it be within or outside our families. If the support is forthcoming, I have no doubt that great help can be given to expectant mothers in what is termed 'crisis pregnancies'. There are some questions about the Bill as proposed. Several of our spokespersons have raised those questions. We hope that in the course of this debate we may be able to get answers to the queries we have raised about the legalities or otherwise of sections of what is proposed. As legislators, we want to be very clear that we support or reject Government proposals only after careful consideration and we are not doing it for any political or other ulterior motive. In some instances our motives in this regard may be misunderstood by the electorate. Some people look at this as a black and white issue, one is either for abortion or for the protection of the rights of the unborn. It is not a black and white issue. We do not want to make circumstances any worse than they are at present. In 1992, when the referendum to protect the life of the unborn under the Constitution was ratified, the electorate thought the issue had been closed. The Supreme Court ruled [93]otherwise. If the referendum is passed, do we want to have someone refer this to the Supreme Court? There are many questions to answer and many questions still to be asked. That is why Fine Gael has proposed what we consider to be a very reasonable amendment. We propose that Committee Stage of this Bill will not proceed for a fixed period until we are able to get answers to the questions which are causing us such grave concerns. I will only touch on some of the questions to be asked. There is a lack of clarity in the proposed regulations and legislation. I want to highlight the 17th Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and how it will sit if the referendum is approved. The 17th Protocol, inserted by the then Fianna Fáil-PD coalition, stated, 'Nothing in the Treaty on the European Union . . . shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40. 3.3 of the Constitution of Ireland.' Article 40. 3.3 states, 'The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.' This referendum proposes to insert Articles 40. 3.4 and 40. 3.5. The Taoiseach has stated that this legislation will have no EU law implications. The Government has changed its opinion on this issue at least two or three times. In the Dáil on October 9 the Taoiseach stated that the change to the Maastricht protocol was probably not necessary. He later stated that a change to the protocol was probably necessary. There are questions hanging over this regarding the EU. There is the issue of a fundamental charter or constitution being drawn up by the EU. There is also the issue of the EU incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights. I understand that some of the case law built up around the convention stresses the right to life of the mother as against the right to life of the unborn. A protocol that cites a particular Article of the Constitution applies only to that section. There are several questions on this issue, I have asked only one that comes to mind. It is reasonable for Fine Gael to want those questions teased out before we have to decide what we are presenting to the people, or what our attitude will be when it is presented. Are we doing something that will help to protect the lives of the mother and the unborn child? Or are we doing something which might affect those rights more seriously and might leave us in worse circumstances than those that now exist? I do not know what the attitude of the people will be to this referendum. I am not getting much feedback on it. What happens if the proposals are defeated in the referendum? Do we introduce legislation to deal with the effects of the X case? Those are among the serious questions that must be addressed before we can come to a conclusion on what the Government is proposing.;3244562

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;M;Mr. Éamon Ó Cuív;Fianna Fáil;Tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt sa díospóireacht fíor-thábhachtach seo. Iarracht macánta é seo déileáil le fadhb atá ann le fada an lá ach nach bhfuil réiteach sásúil faighte uirthi fós. D'éist mé go cúramach leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta Noonan agus caithfidh mé a rá nach bhféadfainn teacht le cuid mhaith dá raibh le rá aige. Thosaigh sé ag úsáid foclóra tar éis go mbíodh muintir a pháirtí ag magadh fúinne agus foclóirí. Ach is léir, nuair a bhreatnaigh sé sa bhfoclóir nár bhreathnaigh sé ar ciall na bhfocal a bhí ann. Bhí sé ag caint ar éiginnteacht. Sa saol seo níl tada cinnte. Ní féidir le haon Dáil nó le haon phairlimint rudaí a achtú go bhfuil céad faoin gcéad cinnteacht ag baint leo. Feicimid é sin gach uile lá. Ach ní stopann sé sin muid ag tabhairt isteach leasaithe bunreachta nó athraithe dlí ar an iliomad ceisteanna. Má chruthaítear níos maille nach bhfuil siad ceart, bíonn orainn iad a leasú arís. Ach níl aon amhras orm gur cuma céard a thabharfaí ar aghaidh faoin gceist seo go bhfaighfí éiginnteacht ann. Tá ceist an-shimplí roimh phobal na hÉireann. Sé sin, an dteastaíonn uathu go leanfaidh an cleachtas leighis sa tír mar atá sé, nó an dteastaíonn uathu go mbeidh ginmhilleadh ar fáil sa tír mar atá sé ar fáil i dtíortha eile. Rogha an-shimplí é sin agus sin an rogha go dteastaíonn ón bpobal go gcuirfear os a gcomhair. Nuair a chuirfear os a gcomhair é beidh orainn, pobal na hÉireann [115]faoin mBunreacht atá againn, glacadh lena gcinneadh. Mar atá cursaí i láthair na huaire tá dhá rud ag teacht salach ar a chéile. Ar an dtaobh amháin tá breithiúnas na Cúirte Uachtaraigh sa gcás seo agus ar an dtaobh eile tá an cleachtas leighis laethúil atá sa tír. Ní maith an rud é go mbeadh an dá rud sin díreach contráilte dá chéile. Táimid ag caint, ar an gcéad dul síos faoi mháithreacha agus an brú a bhíonn orthu nuair a bhíonn siad ag súil le leanbh gan coinne. Tuigimid uilig nach cás éasca é sin do mhná agus go gcaithfear gach uile fhóirithint, cúnamh agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhná sa gcás sin. Sin an fáth go bhfuil áisíneach speisialta dá bhunú chun déileáil le cásanna mar seo. Táimid ag caint freisin, ar ndóigh, ar an ngin gan bhreith san mbroinn. Mar go chreidim go bhfuil an beatha tábhachtach ón am a gintear í go bás nádúrtha, creidim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go ndéantar í a cosaint. Tá mé in aghaidh marú agus tógáil beatha gan chúis. Baineann sin le gach cinéal gnó den chineál sin. Cuireann sé íontas orm go minic go bhfuil sé liobrálach bheith in aghaidh phíonós an bháis agus go bhfuil sé caomhnach bheith ag iarraidh an leanbh sa mbroinn a chosaint. Is aisteach an seasamh é sin agus bíonn sé deacair orm é a thuiscint. Cé tá níos neamh-chiontaí ná leanbh sa mbroinn. Ag an am céanna, níl aithne agam ar éinne gur cás leis cás an linbh sa mbroinn nach cás leis chomh maith cás na máithreacha. Déanann an leasú seo iarracht é sin a chur ina cheart. Deputy Noonan raised many questions which no doubt should be teased out fully on Committee and Report Stages. It is a difficult issue. Crisis pregnancies cause great stress and mothers expecting a child in such a situation are under great pressure. The issue is how we as a society think it is best to address such cases. There seems to be a fundamental difference between the ruling of the Supreme Court in the X case and actual medical practice. This has persisted for some time and we would be in abrogation of our duty if we did not try to reconcile them one way or another. The proposal on which the people will adjudicate is an honest attempt so they can decide whether they want to preserve current medical practice and make sure the Constitution and the law match the practice or to introduce a medical practice which would inevitably lead to the abortion regimes we see in other countries. At its starkest that is the proposition which will be put to the people and it will be up to them to decide. Various details have been raised and no doubt they will be teased out on the floor of the House, as they should be, but I am happy this is a comprehensive and honest attempt to crystallise the issue. Deputy Noonan queried the mechanism being used, and I agree it is an unusual mechanism to use in the Constitution. However, in the circumstances of the debate over the past ten years it is reasonable as time and again we were told this matter could not be put in a crystal clear manner [116]to the people in the form of a three or four line amendment to the Constitution. The people desire to be given a choice and to be as clear as possible in such a complicated issue in terms of what they are choosing. Therefore, the approach, novel though it is, is good and reasonable in the circumstances. I was interested to hear Deputy Noonan say we should put the matter back further. I have not seen an issue given more comprehensive debate, thought, time and consultation, particularly since the Government came to power. There are obviously fundamental differences of opinion on the issue, and I recognise them and accept they are dearly held by people who have differing views. They will not be reconciled and all we can do on the two sides of that fundamental difference of opinion is accept the will of the people. The circle cannot be squared between those who think the medical regime we have is the right one and those who believe that an abortion regime similar to that which pertains in many other countries should be introduced here. Other issues will have to be tackled in future, including that of the unborn outside the womb, but they are matters for another day and I understand they are currently being examined. I do not think it necessary to deal with those issues ahead of the discussions and consultations taking place on them. They are causing great concern and debate in this and other jurisdictions. At times I am puzzled by the use of terminology. It is difficult because of the huge level of emotion to get involved in a debate about words and terminology. One of the great problems of the debate was that many meanings were given to the word 'abortion'– some people include in its definition spontaneous abortion while others include medical treatments which most doctors would not consider to be abortion – and from a legal point of view it was necessary to define abortion. The use of the term 'termination' also causes great confusion. Deputy Noonan was very interested in dictionary definitions, and to me 'to terminate' means to finish, to complete. I once asked an eminent gynaecologist whether there was any particular medical terminology for 'termination' and he said 'No'. I eventually found out that the word 'termination' was lifted from a British Act of Parliament and introduced in common parlance here without having its origin explained. While I do not wish to be facetious, the Opposition has been making great play of small points and possible ambiguities while itself using huge ambiguities. Every pregnancy terminates, and many are terminated by way of medical intervention before the natural completion of the gestation period. Therefore, the word 'termination' on its own does not explain and is an obfuscation of what the debate is about. The Bill deals clearly with this issue. I have been accused of many things during this debate but I have not heard anyone say that if the mother's life could not be [117]saved by some means – an ectopic pregnancy is a good example – other than by the removal of the foetus, the pregnancy should not finish by way of medical intervention. However, the difference arises if a pregnancy is terminated and the unborn is viable. This legislation puts the obligation on the medical practitioner to try to save and sustain the baby. To my layman's way of thinking, this is the fundamental difference between abortion as we know it throughout the world and current medical practice in this country. At all times all medical practitioners here make sure the life of the mother is sustained but, as far as practicable in all circumstances, they do so with the dual purpose of trying to ensure that the life of the unborn is also sustained. While abortion as we know it in common terms is about the deliberate destruction of the unborn, the legislation before us seeks to get away from this loose terminology and arrive at a clear definition so that these two fundamental differences are recognised. I recall a number of years ago a question being asked in the Dáil by a then Opposition Deputy in regard to maternal deaths as a result of pregnancy in Ireland compared to other European Union countries. One thing that became clear, aside from deaths caused while abortions were being carried out, was that, thanks be to God, pregnant women in Ireland were safer than in other European Union countries. No one in Ireland who cares about this issue would put a woman's life unnecessarily at risk. An objective of all of us is to honestly say this is the safest country not just in Europe but in the world for a woman to be expecting a child, and that is something towards which we all work and aspire. It seems from the figures given that there is no medical evidence to show that the introduction of social abortion in any way moves us from that point. The opposite is the case. I was fascinated to hear Deputy Noonan refer to EU law and the protocol to the treaty because I raised that issue to the consternation of my colleagues in the parliamentary party when I read the protocol as protecting Article 40. 3.3WP extended char 6,36 as it was, and, therefore, in the event of a further referendum perhaps not covering the situation. Many Opposition Members at the time thought I was losing the run of myself. These people would not listen to the point I was trying to make and were quick to brand me as a whole lot of things. However, when the Government of the day, led by Deputy Albert Reynolds, went to the European Union and got the solemn declaration, which is mentioned in the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Noonan, I was satisfied – I am still satisfied – to trust the member states of the European Union in that undertaking that whatever we decide on this issue will be respected by the European institutions. I am absolutely amazed that almost ten years later those who scoff use this as another reason it is not a good proposal. I am still willing to accept their good faith on that issue. After ten years it is about time to take our [118]courage in our hands in this House and go to the people, after what has been a long period of consultation, with what is a very comprehensive, balanced and good proposal. There are those who do not favour it because they would prefer a different regime. I cannot understand why these people do not favour holding a referendum or why they cannot come up with a better proposal after all this time. As I said at the beginning, for the first time since the X case the people of Ireland will get a clear choice, that is, to vote for the preservation of current medical practice in Ireland or to vote against this proposition for the ruling given in the X case, which would, despite what Deputy Noonan says, inevitably lead to the introduction of social abortion similar to that which pertains in other European countries. The choice is stark. It should be put to the people and I look forward to the issue being decided by the people in the new year.;3244563

1994;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;M;Mr. Denis Naughten;Fine Gael;I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I want to focus on section 1(1) of the Bill on the definition of abortion. Abortion is defined in the legislation as terminating life after implantation rather than conception and that will lead to huge ethical problems in the not too distant future. The publication in February 2001 of the draft sequence of the human genome has set in motion a new area of genetic research which will have far-reaching implications. This milestone in scientific research brings with it huge potential to treat genetic disorders but also leads to complex ethical questions. This knowledge of the genetic make-up of human beings has implications for society's concepts of race, equality, disability and social responsibility. To date, the emotive debate surrounding this area of research has focused on human reproduction and, specifically, on assisted pregnancy and cloning. There is no legislative framework in this country to regulate either of these two areas, with only minimum guidance under the Irish Medical Council guidelines. The question of whether the constitutional right to life, under article 40. 3.3WP extended char 6,36 provides protection in the area of assisted reproduction has not been answered. However, following the publication of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, any protection which may have prevailed in this area is removed, with the redefinition of the commencement of life as following implantation rather than conception itself. With this redefinition of life, there is now an urgent need to establish a regulatory framework in this area. Across the European Union, legislation ranges from the UK situation, where the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority regulates and licenses research and clinical practice in genetic technology involving embryos. The UK situation allows research on embryos and the creation of embryos for scientific research purposes under licence. This situation contrasts with the position in [119]Austria and Germany where legislation is extremely restrictive. In Germany, embryo protection regulations are among the strictest in the world, forbidding research that harms the embryo or the production of embryos for any purpose other than to start a pregnancy. However, human embryo stem cell lines produced in other countries may be imported for research in Germany. While there are contrasting views on the level of embryo regulation throughout the EU, each country believes that this research must be regulated. It would be irresponsible to enact this Bill without reference to this background as this would lead to huge ethical problems in the near future. In Ireland, an ethical quandary currently surrounds the fate of unused embryos for use in in vitro fertilisation – IVF – programmes but there are other elements which must also be considered in relation to assisted reproduction. Assisted human reproduction or in vitro fertilisation, as it is commonly called, has been practised successfully in Ireland for many years. Shortly after the technology became available, clinics attached to maternity units were set up in some hospitals. Infertile couples in this country were as anxious to avail of the treatment as those in other countries. Many more clinics have been established in recent years, some of which are associated with clinics in the UK. There is no Irish legislation to control the establishment of such clinics or to regulate the procedures currently carried out in them. Senator Henry introduced a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad to put such regulation in place but, regrettably, the Government voted it down. Genetic information has vast potential to affect reproductive choice. Among the practices associated with genetics and reproduction are IVF programmes, embryo freezing, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – PGD – enhancement gene therapy and cloning. Enhancement gene therapy has the ability to manipulate genes to influence the characteristics of a baby and this has given rise to as much public disquiet as cloning. Again, in Ireland there is no legislation either prohibiting or regulating genetics-related reproductive practices. The only regulation is under the voluntary guidelines of the IMO, which contains a general statement that gene manipulation with the aim of improvement of health may be ethical, while the creation of embryos for experimental purposes would be professional misconduct. The lack of legislation in this regard has caused considerable concern for Ministers for Health for some years. The Medical Council guidelines are insufficient because they have no legal standing and many people involved in assisted human reproduction are not medical practitioners. They are either physiologists or other members of the scientific community who are not covered by those guidelines. IVF programmes, artificial insemination by anonymous donors and embryo freezing are currently practised in Ireland. Advances in genetic [120]knowledge means that IVF programmes may allow the selection of embryos before they are implanted in the womb, which is called PGD. This raises the prospect of even fertile couples, where there is a risk passing on defective genes, deciding to opt for IVF to remove this risk. PGD also allows the possibility of selecting the sex of a foetus before it is implanted into the womb. In the UK, sex selection is banned except when justified for medical reasons. The other element of research is cloning. Concerns have been raised by the cloning of animals and, no doubt, most people have heard of Dolly the sheep. There are two distinct types of cloning, reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning. Human reproductive cloning involves creating genetically identical foetuses, while therapeutic cloning involves cloning human embryo cells under two weeks old for the purposes of research into diseases such as Parkinson's disease, cancer, strokes, heart disease etc. Much of the revulsion to human cloning is based on the notion of human dignity and treating human life in an instrumental manner. The current state of scientific advances is such that cloning is extremely hazardous, with a success rate of between 3% and 5%. In Ireland, there is no regulation prohibiting or controlling either types of cloning. This is in contrast to most European states which have enacted legislation banning human reproductive cloning. In certain countries, such as Germany and Spain, an attempt at human cloning is a criminal offence. In Britain, cloning is regulated under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, 1990. Although there is no explicit ban on cloning in that legislation, it requires a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority which has indicated that no such licence would be granted. Various international measures have been taken to outlaw reproductive cloning. Article 11 of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights states: 'Practices which are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not be permitted.' The European Parliament has passed a resolution calling on member states and the UN to implement a legally binding universal ban on human cloning. The European Parliament, in its resolution on human cloning, considers that there is no difference between cloning for therapeutic purposes and cloning for the purposes of reproduction and that the relaxation of the current ban will lead to pressure of further developments in embryo production and usage. Such therapeutic cloning irreversibly crosses a boundary in research norms and is contrary to public policy as adopted by the European Union. The European Parliament urged that maximum effort be aimed at therapies using stem cells taken from adult subjects. This is an area of research which has been developed for some years and has had some positive elements to it. National and Union authorities should ensure that the ban on patenting or cloning human beings is reaffirmed [121]and that rules are adopted to that end. Again, we have no Irish laws on any of those matters, contrary to the policy stated by the European Parliament. For many years the United States has been torn apart by arguments about abortion. Anyone who has read up on that debate will be extremely conscious of how heated it has been. Abortion clinics have been bombed and there have been other violent actions by various fundamental organisations there. However, that paled into insignificance when compared with the debate held in the US this summer on a more complicated series of questions regarding stem cell research. This debate, which has taken up much of the time of the Congress and Senate, has covered the ethical aspects of stem cell research and whether it should be funded by the US Government. President Bush spent much of his summer agonising over whether to allow federal money to support research into stem cells that have been extracted from embryos. The House of Representatives voted for a Bill that would ban all forms of human cloning. Stem cells can be encouraged to grow into any sort of cell and thus prove invaluable in helping to find cures to diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Given that stem cells can be manipulated into any organ in the body, they form an extremely useful research tool. The US regulatory regime is in a complete mess. The US Government's only source of control is through the money it spends in funding research programmes. This gives considerable clout to industry. Its reluctance to spend money on stem cell research in the United States has persuaded many American scientists to carry out their research in the more liberal regime that exists in the United Kingdom. This still leaves scientists free to do pretty much what they want provided they use private money. The current lack of a regulatory framework means that a similar situation pertains here. The only regulation that exists relates to the Medical Council. As you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, know quite well, most of this research is carried out by scientists who do not have to abide by the guidelines set down by the Irish Medical Council or any other equivalent body. Furthermore, none of these scientists, either during their education or professional practice, have to address the issue of the ethical implications of research they do. It is not part of their training and it is a matter for Government to lay down the legislation and regulations to govern the research they carry out. In the US, due to the lack of regulations, private industry has carried out an immense amount of research with serious ethical implications. The same thing could in theory happen here and the protection which was available under the Constitution will now be removed under this legislation given the new definition of abortion. In the United States, one cult is trying to clone [122]humans. A company recently announced plans to harvest embryos. Another company is offering a service to couples whereby they can choose the sex of their child – the list goes on. Everyone agrees that this area is a mess without a legislative framework. We have the most lax system in the European Union because we have not been prepared to tackle the issue. To date, the only protection against the potential abuse of embryos has been under article 40. 3.3WP extended char 6,36 of the Constitution. Even the legal interpretation of that protection has been in doubt for some time. There is no doubt that the legislation as it now stands, if passed, will remove that semblance of protection. The Government should take due consideration of that point before proceeding further with this legislation. I can guarantee that within 12 months of this legislation being passed, voted on by the people and written into the Constitution, there will be an even bigger lobby raising questions and looking for further legislation in the area of cloning and human reproduction. The protection of embryos, stem cell research, the use of stem cells for genetic manipulation and what we decide to do with the frozen embryos or zygotes which are stored in the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin are all open for debate. This debate will be at least as heated as the abortion debates here have been in the past. For years politicians in the United States knew on which side of the divide they were in the abortion debate. However, many of them do not know where to turn on this area because it is not a black and white issue. It is a grey area that will lead to huge complications. I am disappointed this is not being addressed by the Government through this legislation. It is a fundamental issue and to go ahead with the legislation without putting that protection or regulation in place is irresponsible, and it would be irresponsible for this House to approve that legislation. I therefore support my party's position that the passing of Second Stage be postponed until these very real issues, raised by me and my party leader, Deputy Noonan, are addressed by the Government. What we are doing is opening a further can of worms that will not lead to the solution that this Government expects. Cuireadh an díospóireacht ar athló. Debate adjourned.;3244565
1995;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;F;Ms. Mary Wallace;Fianna Fáil;I welcome the Government's package of proposals for constitutional and legislative reform in regard to the protection of human life in pregnancy. As someone who campaigned extensively during the 1983 referendum campaign to insert the eighth amendment in the Constitution I am only too aware of how emotive is this important issue. I fully agree with the Taoiseach that doing nothing is not an option. The only defence against the widespread use of the X case as a basis for social abortion is the ethical consensus in the medical profession and the terms of the 1983 amendment demand a legislative response from the Oireachtas to protect the right to life of the unborn child and the equal right to life of the mother. It is obvious from talking to people from many different backgrounds in recent years that people are not happy with the current position of abortion in the Constitution. Citizens want something done about this issue. That is why I am delighted with this initiative as it gives all of us an opportunity to amend the Constitution to ensure the right to life of the unborn and to protect the life of the mother. It is not right that the only defence against the widespread use of the X case as a basis for social abortion is the ethical consensus of the medical profession. The vast majority of people are not comfortable with this position and it puts an unfair burden on the profession. I urge everybody to take this opportunity to put things right and support the Government's proposal for constitutional change. The outcome of the 1992 referendum left a widespread feeling of unfinished business and the electorate has demanded a response in terms of constitutional or legislative change or both. The Taoiseach's stated position prior to the 1997 general election was that the key element in establishing a national consensus and in creating a workable legal basis for protecting the life of both women and the unborn is to give the people a direct say in resolving that unfinished business. I am delighted for those reasons that the Taoiseach's commitment has been fulfilled and the electorate will be given an opportunity to put things right in the Constitution on this occasion. The Government's package of proposals has resulted from detailed consultation and consideration since 1997 and could not be described as a knee jerk reaction or as being hastily cobbled together. There has been a lengthy, democratic and inclusive process. The Government established an interdepartmental working group in 1997 whose findings were considered by a Cabinet sub-committee and the process resulted in the publication of a Green Paper in September 1999. The Green Paper, in turn, was referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by [95]Deputy Brian Lenihan, and there was general agreement during the committee's proceedings. Its report was fair, balanced and of value in educating and informing public opinion. The Government then established a Cabinet sub-committee to consider the options and to prepare proposals for consideration and the all-party committee reported in November 2000. The outcome of these extensive deliberations has led us to conclude that no single sentence or paragraph can be inserted in the Constitution which by itself would amount to a balanced, effective legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy. I am very much in favour as a result of our proposal to amend the Constitution and to bring in legislation which will allow us to strike a complex balance. There are a few important issues for the electorate, the first of which relates to what the amendment will do. I am satisfied the amendment, which will insert two new subsections in Article 40. 3.3 of the Constitution, and the parallel legislation will address the complex issue surrounding the protection of unborn human life. At the same time the amendment ensures that pregnant women will continue to have access to all necessary medical treatment if problems arise in the course of their pregnancy. It is also important, as the electorate goes to vote, that people understand the relationship between the referendum and the legislation. A key element of the proposal is that the amendment will only be made if the Oireachtas enacts this Bill, as drafted, within six months. This is only right and proper because it is imperative that the people know exactly what they are voting for and when they do so they will be clear on what the legislation will entail. The Bill is in line with the third option outlined in the all-party committee's report. For the first time in legislation the Bill protects women and the unborn in pregnancy. It accommodates existing medical practice, which safeguards the life of the woman from exposure to real and substantial risk and it gives complete protection to the necessary medical procedures. It protects the life of the unborn in the strongest way and it protects against social abortion. It is important to deal in the debate with issues such as suicide and the right to travel. The Bill provides that the risk of suicide will no longer be grounds for legal abortion in this State. The Government believes that the conclusions in the report of the all-party committee do not support maintenance of the suicide risk as grounds for abortion in Ireland and I fully concur with this view. It should be noted that the risk of suicide has only been advanced as grounds for abortion in cases where the State directly or indirectly attempted to restrict the freedom of the woman to travel. The terms of the new law will protect that freedom to travel as was decreed by the people in the 1992 referendum. Deputy McCormack spoke about the third [96]option and I agree with him. The Government has also shown its concern for women in crisis pregnancy by the establishment of the new crisis pregnancy agency by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. The crisis pregnancy agency will draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy, promote options other than abortion and provide post-abortion services. Crucially, preventative issues concerning education of young people and adults as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles will be addressed. It is incumbent on all of us to do all in our power to assist women in considering options other than abortion. A woman faced with a crisis pregnancy should be enabled to consider other options carefully and should be assisted before making a decision on the course of action she wishes to take. These are the issues that will be dealt with by the new crisis pregnancy agency. The proposals for constitutional and legislative change regarding the protection of human life in pregnancy are part of the Government's response to the issue of crisis pregnancy. The crisis pregnancy agency will play a major role in the development of co-ordinated responsive and appropriate services. It is the Government's hope that over time this will reduce the instances of crisis pregnancies among Irish women and give women in this situation the widest possible range of assistance. We all know that this is one of the most difficult issues that can ever face a person, be it in private or public life. Just because it is a difficult issue does not mean that we should run away from it. The proposals which will be put before the people represent what this Government believes to be a fair reflection of the point of view that abortion should not be permitted in this country but that we must also safeguard medical procedures required to protect the lives of mothers. The legal proposals are supported by the first comprehensive national initiative to help prevent unwanted pregnancies and to support women who find themselves in a crisis pregnancy. I have never made any secret of the fact that I am a supporter of the pro life movement and that I do not want abortion on demand in this country. I am satisfied that the Government proposals offer very strong protection for the unborn and ensure that social abortion will not be available in Ireland. I welcome the fact that our legislation offers protection to the lives of mothers and at long last a Government of this country has had the foresight to set up an agency to deal with crisis pregnancy.;3244566

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;M;Mr. Michael D. Higgins;The Labour Party;I have some sympathy for those who are asking for mature, rational, sympathetic and carefully thought out debate. Unfortunately, having been involved in most referenda dealing with matters like this for over a quarter of a century, history is against such an aspiration. The referendum will be bitter and divisive. The degree to which it is so may vary. My hope is like [97]theirs, that it will not be so, but it is likely that it will at least in some places be just that. I recall just over 25 years ago when I was a Member of the other House being one of the co-signatories to a Bill to abolish the status of illegitimacy. On that occasion the Bill was defeated with only 12 votes in favour. That was in 1974-75. When I made the case for the rights of the child born out of wedlock I was accused by a Senator of the day of being in favour of 'socialism under the sheets'. That was the phrase used. The suggestion was that the son of the big farmer in Meath or elsewhere had the right to go to the dogs. It was suggested in the Seanad that he could 'sow his wild oats' with total impunity from any consequences of his actions. The real social danger of that time in the 1970s was that the farm would be put in danger by such a child emerging out of the darkness and claiming the rights to property that the other children in the family might have. It was an abject time and it was a despicable kind of debate. At that time, such children were being sent into institutions which were not invigilated by the Departments of the day and we are now dealing with the consequences of the abandoned and unwanted children. Going back a decade earlier to my county of Clare, a district justice on a bad day would advise someone who had committed a crime that he should go to England. The defending solicitor would stand up and say: 'Your Honour, he is going to England tomorrow'. We could get rid of our problems to England. This is precisely what this proposal does – the difficult case of a woman in the greatest distress, prone to suicide being told this afternoon in the month of November 2001, that she is free to travel. Just as before, the women would be driven into the Magdalen home, just as before the women would be driven from their parish. Now the grounds of being prone to suicide that are accepted in medical practice all around the world will not be recognised in modern, progressive Ireland. The woman is told that she is free to travel. Why? Because the absolutists at home wanted to create a situation where they are able to exercise judgments which I would find difficult to make. The distinguished public servant, Dr. Whitaker, whom I admire in so many different ways for his contribution to Irish life, chaired the 1996 expert constitutional review group. He considered the issue in detail and came to the conclusion that there was no consensus as to what any amendment of the Constitution should be, that not only should the Government legislate in line with the X case but that it was the only practical possibility that was available. Now what is happening? We are going to the country to stop a woman prone to suicide from having facilities available to her that were available up to now. In addition, we are refusing to legislate. You, Sir, are chairing a Legislature – this Dáil – and this House has my respect. Is it [98]not an extraordinary situation where the Constitution is to be used as some kind of trailer before the main film? You have a referendum to throw into the Constitution something that may come to be from the Legislature in the future. All those who wrote about constitutions – people like Sartori, the distinguished theorist of constitutions – said that constitutions should have certainty. That principle is violated here. What is happening is that the Government being gutless refuses to legislate in accordance with the X case and, more than that, no member of the medical profession can tell me or has told me that legislation would not suffice to satisfy such medical practice as was taking place. On the contrary, they said if the legislation would only become coterminous with the constitutional provision, then in our far from perfect situation, we would be able to continue. However, the Government has decided to go to the people to ensure that, in the rare cases where a woman is prone to suicide, she will go to England. I listened carefully to some of the previous speakers who said that what happens in another jurisdiction is none of our business. I have been interested all my life in human rights and defining them universally. What happens in other jurisdictions is our business. For example, it is our business if a pregnant woman in Afghanistan dies because the religious fundamentalists there refuse to allow a male doctor give her assistance. The rights of women everywhere are our business. What happens to women, children and men in any other jurisdiction is our business. In terms of the difficult case, having made a mockery of the Constitution and scandalously distorting the relationship between it and the role of the Legislature, it is typical that some then say it is fine as long as the woman is heading out of the country. There is a notion that this is fine because there are so few cases. If there are so few, why have a referendum? Why not legislate to deal with them?;3244567

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;M;Mr. Michael D. Higgins;The Labour Party;The answer is that somebody promised someone a referendum. I have been through many referenda and recall the type of letters I received in the past. One of the reasons I called a quorum earlier is that I remember from previous discussions on these matters how wounding and awful it must be for the women involved. A previous referendum on divorce was rejected, not for any social, ethical or republican reasons, but on the basis of property rights. When it fell I remember thinking of all the women who had described their personal circumstances, but received a comprehensive slap in the face. Nevertheless, they had to continue on. In those debates, and in this one to some extent, one did not hear much about the responsibility of relationships. This aspect is interesting because the people who sent postcards to me are the same people who tried to block sex education [99]in schools. They were in favour of a discussion of relationships in the education system provided it had nothing to do with sex. These people also opposed other moves, such as giving advice to children at risk about what they should do to protect themselves. It must be wonderful to live in a world of certainties where one hardly needs to look at one's body at all and where all relationships are in some etherised space with certainty. In that world everything is black and white. One should think, however, of how much Irish history would have been different if proper social responsibility had been inculcated in men and women. I remember 1974-75 when I spoke in the Seanad. I recall the strong farmer coming up for a night at the dogs and to impregnate a woman and how upset he would be if he was reminded of the responsibility involved in bringing an unwanted child into the world, a child who would be slapped into an institution that could be described in Dostoevskian terms. This is one of the scandals of republican Ireland. They turned their eyes away, leaving the children there to be abused. When it was uncovered in one report after another they buried the reports and lost the files in the Department. This is the reality of the situation. This is not a country where all children are cherished equally, where every act that could bring a child into existence could be regarded as one of love. It is not a country which encourages responsibility. Fundamentalist thinking has stood in the way of proper education in schools in the same way as it did regarding the original proposals in the mother and child scheme 50 years ago. This scheme would have protected the mother and child from the moment of pregnancy up to the age of 12 years, but it was shot down by an act of fundamentalism and gutless cowardice and interference by the medical profession. The Bill is nothing heroic. It is seedy and abject. It arose from a half promise it was fixed up. The attitude is that it can be thrown into the Constitution because the Constitution does not matter any more. How can anybody who believes in the sovereignty of the division of powers in terms of the balance between the President, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Administration agree with it? We should remember that not only does it imply that we distrust ourselves and are incapable of legislating, but it suggests that future legislators in the House must have their hands tied because they cannot be trusted either. The result is to put a spancel on the hands of legislators. If one thinks of legislation in the future in accordance with medical practice or changing scientific opinion, one will have no right to introduce it. Legislators who vote for the Bill that enables this referendum to take place are damaging the integrity of their own profession. The Bill implies that legislators today and in the future cannot be trusted. It also states that women cannot be trusted. It was suggested on the Govern[100]ment benches that a woman would affect proneness to suicide. That tells me much more about the Deputies who said it than it does about women. How many such cases have arisen? Where is the proof for their statement? I was a sociologist for 25 years and know that being prone to suicide is a very serious matter. It can be engaged with professionally it is not invented. The Taoiseach, in his wisdom and in the little breaks he took apart from soccer, came to the conclusion that allowing the suicide ground would somehow set us down the slippery slope to what he calls social abortion. From where did he get that nonsense? It is another cheap justification for what is, in fact, a seedy exercise. I welcome the consensus, however late for so many, that we should do everything possible to assist those experiencing what is for them a crisis pregnancy. We agree on this and should not be mealy-mouthed about it. If the Government wants to put resources into that area, I pay tribute to it, the commission which suggested it and everybody involved in it. This is the way forward. It will be good to have an agency that is not censorious. We should remember the assumptions that guided all the practice up to now, such as 'the fallen woman.' Such women headed for the laundry and some did not come out again for 20 or 30 years. If their pregnancies went to full term, their children were taken away from them. Holy people – again, wonderful absolutists – said they must not even know where their children had gone and should put them out of their minds. This was the experience in Ireland and it is not over yet. The wounded are all around us. The suggestion is that a change can be made to the Constitution in relation to legislation that will be passed later. How can the Minister of State square the existing Article 40. 3.3º with the two new sections? I am not a lawyer, but, with the greatest respect, they are not consistent with each other. Perhaps the Minister of State could also tell us how the Government arrived at a penalty of 12 years for a woman who takes one of the non-allowed termination procedures and also how it arrived at the other penalties. Who gave the Government that figure? Who suggested there was a benefit in criminalising a woman in this manner? There is nothing republican about that move. There are other minor points in the context of the sloppy way the legislation is drafted. One presumes from the text that it does not only apply to doctors who are registered medical practitioners. It appears it will not apply at all to non-registered medical practitioners, which is interesting. I want to refer to the suggestion by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, that what happens in another jurisdiction does not matter. That was de Valera's view before the Commission on Emigration, 1948 to 1951, was set up. Prior to its establishment, de Valera comprehensively ignored Irish people who were forced to go to England. What happens in other jurisdictions is our business. What right has the Minister, Deputy Moffatt, to tell Irish citizens [101]they must travel to another jurisdiction in conditions of total uncertainty, over which they have no control, to seek a resolution of their problems? I find the absence of trust at the heart of this proposal very interesting – an absence of trust in a woman who is likely to lie and say she is inclined towards suicide, an absence of trust in the Legislature or current or future legislators, an absence of trust in doctors and an absence of trust in the Constitution. Doctors and medical practitioners made their views clear. They said 'legislate and get on with it'. That is what a real Government would have done. This Government, however, did the hucksters deal which meant it had to have the brand name of the absolutists on its actions. I sincerely hope these advocates will preface all their public comment on this issue by saying they were always in favour of helping women in these situations. I will then be able to look them in the eye and tell them that is untrue. Institutions were packed with children who were abandoned to conditions which the Government of the day would not monitor. Why? Because it was more moral and worthy to choose not to know than to become engaged or involved. Men and women need a commitment to responsibility in their relationships. A woman undergoing a very distressing and difficult period needs compassion. She needs to be able to listen to a doctor's advice and to have all the options made available to her. She does not need to be told that some of the options are only available at the very earliest stages and, even following an act of violence, will get her 12 years in jail. Do not insult my intelligence by suggesting there is anything wonderfully caring about that. The Government has come up with this little seedy sideways arrangement because it is too gutless to legislate for this matter. Members of the public will have a long time to consider this issue because there will be no rush to put this to the people other than from the fundamentalist wing of Fianna Fáil who will thump their breasts and operate like political mullahs throughout the country. The public, which is very decent in regard to these issues, has moved on, if the experience of my clinics is anything to go by, and this will show in the referendum. Members of this House must sometimes stand up for certain issues because they are personally important to them. I respect people who hold a different view from me on this issue and distinguish between them and some of the people I have spoken about. I respect the views of people whose construction of the moment at which life begins, for example, leads them to a set of conclusions which they must follow in their politics. Unfortunately, previous campaigns were characterised by people who sought to impose their certainties in a situation which requires sensitivity and respect for complexity. I would not have the courage, which most theologians have lacked but which the Government obviously has, to define so precisely the moment of implantation from [102]which protection will begin and after which certain courses of action will be allowed or disallowed.;3244569
1999;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Dara C&eacute im (At&oacute g&aacute il). Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;14.11.01;F;Ms. Mary Hanafin;Fianna Fáil;I support the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, for three main reasons. First, it represents a serious attempt to come to grips with a very complex and sensitive issue in a forthright manner which confronts the real problems everyone agrees exist. We are not running away from these problems, nor are we seeking to make political capital out of them. Second, the Bill represents the culmination of an exemplary process of participatory democracy with consultation of the widest kind ever undertaken over several years which offered a variety of opportunities to people of all shades of opinion to have their views entered into the deliberative process. Everyone has taken the process seriously and it is now our turn, as legislators, to do likewise. People rightly expect this of us. Third, the Bill is based on a sustained effort to identify and build on the areas of consensus in the medical profession, among psychiatrists and in the general public. This proposal represents an effort in good faith to address the difficult questions raised by crisis pregnancy and the unsatisfactory aftermath of the X case rulings. Given the sensitive nature of this issue, I hope the debate on this Bill will not be characterised by political rancour. We should give each other the space necessary to express our differing points of view and I hope the reasoned argument and temperate tone which, for the most part, has been adopted in this House will continue outside it. The challenge for Oireachtas Members is to talk through our differences on this vital issue with mutual respect with a view to working together to find real and practical solutions to the problems associated with crisis pregnancy. As legislators, we have a grave obligation to underpin in law the constitutional guarantees given in Article 40. 3.3º which states: 'The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.' This article sets legislators a difficult challenge, namely, to enact laws which give real legal effect to the guarantees of protection for the mother and the unborn. While we may not relish the prospect of addressing these issues, we were not elected to this House merely to do that which is easy or pleasant. We have a job to do and the people who elected us want us to do it even where, indeed especially where, it is difficult. Oireachtas Members will not forget the passage of the X case rulings in which a member of the Supreme Court excoriated the Oireachtas for failing to enact the laws called for by Article 40. 3.3º. This issue is unfinished business and this [103]Bill tackles the most difficult aspect of it, namely, finding a formula of words which, on the one hand, safeguards the lawfulness of essential medical treatment needed to preserve the life of the mother which unavoidably results in the death of the unborn while, on the other hand, making abortion unlawful. I support the Bill because I believe it makes a genuine, imaginative and original effort to do just that. The wording has achieved the right balance and it is time for us as legislators to grasp the nettle and finish the unfinished business of Article 40. 3.3º by enacting a law which finds the right balance between the legal protection of the mother and the unborn. When the Taoiseach undertook to refer this issue to the people following a process of consultation, nobody could have foreseen the extent of the public's participation in the process. Tens of thousands of submissions were made by experts and ordinary people from all walks of life, reflecting a huge range of different approaches. The extent of the public's participation in the process of consultation sent the very important message to this House that they consider this to be a matter of utmost importance and demand that we treat it with responsibility and gravity. In other countries, abortion has been introduced by the courts or by Parliament, with little or no public participation in the debate. As was stated at the Oireachtas hearings on this issue, nothing has taken place anywhere in the world comparable to the process of consultation in Ireland. It is a sign of the healthy and vigorous state of Irish democracy. A crisis pregnancy is a crisis for two reasons, because a woman needs considerable help and support to cope with it if she is to feel able to have her child and because having an abortion is a terrible option for a woman. If abortion were not such a serious matter, she would not dread having to undergo it. Foreign commentators who have spoken to people in Ireland about this issue have remarked on the unanimity of those on both sides who believe that abortion is a terribly difficult choice. This is an important part of the consensus in Ireland. There is almost universal agreement here that abortion is a terrible option and that we have failed a woman in a fundamental way if she feels she has no option but to have an abortion. We have abandoned such women. The positive side of the consensus is the broad public support for the establishment of a crisis pregnancy agency. The agency will deliver a wide range of practical supports so that women facing crisis pregnancy feel they have real and positive alternatives to abortion. When calls are made for abortion as a way of confronting the reality of crisis pregnancy, we may forget to reflect on the enormity of the practice of abortion in other countries. Abortion on demand inevitably follows from the introduction of abortion. In Britain, abortion is legal up to 24 weeks and up to birth in cases of foetal disability. Ireland has the advantage of being able to look [104]to other jurisdictions where abortion has been introduced in recent decades. Having surveyed the effects of these policies, can we really say that crisis pregnancy is confronted in a manner that addresses the needs of women with unexpected pregnancies and respects the right to life of the unborn child? Recent figures show that 6,000 or perhaps close to 7,000 Irish women seek abortions in Britain, which is a tragically high figure, although low in British or EU terms. There is every reason to be optimistic about the prospects of slowing or reversing this trend. A study by Evelyn Mahon of Trinity College Dublin into crisis pregnancy identified a number of problem areas that prompt women to seek abortion. By addressing these problems, we can give women real alternatives to abortion. As it becomes ever more widely perceived that these supports are in place and are adequate, an increasing number of women will choose to avail of them. We need to keep in mind what makes abortion such a uniquely sensitive issue. The reason it is so terrible for a woman is that it involves her in the loss of the unborn life she is carrying. If another life were not involved, the choice would not be so fraught, with the risk of emotional hurt and harm. As legislators, we should approach the issue with maturity and responsibility. Article 40. 3.3º places on us the obligation of devising a law that protects 'the right to life of the unborn', 'with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother'. Our task has been made more difficult by the X case judgment which restricted the protection offered to the unborn and ruled that a threat of suicide grounded a right to abortion without medical evidence. It falls to us as legislators to take the next step in redressing the legal situation left by that judgment. The abortion right created in the X case judgment has no time limit, meaning that abortion is allowable up to and during birth. No medical evidence of any kind is required. The threat of suicide triggers a right to abortion, effectively facilitating abortion on demand. Nobody who shares the broad consensus identified at the oral hearings can stand over such a situation with their hand on their heart. The Government's proposal is an honest effort to find a meaningful and workable solution to the issue, after exhaustive deliberations. I ask people to recognise the situation that exists and I ask them to support fully this proposal. The oral hearings heard expert evidence from a number of psychiatrists who made it clear that abortion is not indicated medically and psychiatrically in cases of depression and suicidal inclination. A Finnish study was quoted, which showed a significantly high incidence of suicide among those who had an abortion compared with those who had given birth. The study looked at women of child-bearing age who committed suicide. Specifically, it compared the number of women who committed suicide after having a baby and the number of women who did so after [105]having an abortion. It was found that the number of women who committed suicide after having a child was half the number of women of child-bearing age without a child who did so. The number of women who committed suicide after having an abortion was almost six times the number of those who had given birth. Having a baby was strongly linked to a lower rate of suicide and having an abortion was strongly linked with a significantly higher rate of suicide. As legislators, we should not disregard this expert testimony as we have a clear and compelling obligation to take it on board. With all other Members, I have compassion and sympathy with women who feel that the only alternative to going through a crisis pregnancy is suicide. Equally, I believe that taking the life of the unborn is not the solution to this problem. I am satisfied that the removal of the suicide ground in the Government's proposal is in line with the consensus of psychiatric evidence presented at the oral hearings. It is the right way to deal with this element of the rulings in the X case. The most difficult task facing the drafters of this proposal was to strike a balance between banning abortion and safeguarding the lawful availability of the medical treatment needed to preserve the mother's life, which may unavoidably lead to the death of the unborn. The balance has been successfully reached. The turning point in the process was a letter from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, submitted to the all-party committee in response to a request from Deputy Brian Lenihan. For the first time, the letter articulated the consensus among obstetricians and gynaecologists concerning the most difficult medical conditions that impact on pregnancy. Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution was passed by the people, to whom the final say concerning questions of national policy rests, according to Article 6 of the Constitution. Article 40. 3.3º requires the Oireachtas to enact laws to embody the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn, as far as practicable. The Constitution contains the two-patient model of pregnancy that has always informed the ethos of Irish medicine. A doctor treating a pregnant woman has not one but two patients, as he has to look out for both mother and baby. Article 40. 3.3º provides a secure legal foundation for current ethical medical practice. Unlike British abortion law, which makes abortion a crime and defines medical treatment where the unborn life is lost as a form of abortion, the 25th amendment of the Constitution will make legal history, by distinguishing between abortion and medical treatment where the baby's life is lost as a result of treatment needed to save the mother's life. The central passage in the letter from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is the template for the approach that followed in the Government's proposal. The institute saw a fundamental difference between [106]abortion carried out with the intention of taking the life of the baby, for example, as social abortion, and the unavoidable death of the baby, resulting from essential treatment to protect the life of the mother. The proposed constitutional amendment is based on the fundamental difference between abortion and treatment mentioned in the letter sent by the obstetricians and gynaecologists. The Government's proposal does not redefine the beginning of life. It has nothing to say about life prior to implantation or treatment of the human embryo. These stages of human existence remain protected by Article 40. 3.3º and this measure does not affect that. The passage of this Bill will not prevent measures which seek to protect unborn life at earlier stages from being introduced in the future. Legislation in relation to embryo research may be introduced, for example. It is important we acknowledge that this wording draws a legal line between abortion and medical treatment to protect the life of the mother, unavoidably resulting in the death of the unborn, for the first time. At the same time, it reverses the legal effects of the X ruling, which lessened the protection which the people wanted Article 40. 3.3º to give to the unborn. To restore the proper degree of protection to the unborn while at the same time protecting the life of the mother, the X ruling needed to be reversed. This Bill's proposed amendment does this in two stages. It excludes the threat of suicide as a ground for abortion in line with the psychiatrist's evidence presented at the oral hearings and it obliges the doctor, when working to preserve the life of the mother, to have regard also to the duty to preserve the life of the unborn, as far as practicable. It is because it manages to do all these things at the same time that I am confident that it will win the approval of the people as an honest attempt to put right the legal situation left in the wake of the 1992 Supreme Court ruling. This legislation and proposed amendment is unique in that it refers legislation for support in the Constitution to the people. It refers it to the people who voted in 1992 and 1993. They are entitled to the opportunity to give their direct voice to this proposal which displays the sensitive, understanding and compassionate response required from all of us.;3244570

Deputy Jim O'Keeffe represented our party on the all-party committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas on the issue of abortion. The Fine Gael proposal to protect women in crisis preg[107]nancies has been accepted by all parties in the House. I thank Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Gay Mitchell who, in Private Members' time, brought forward a Bill to ensure that an agency would be established to assist women in crisis pregnancies. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has set up such an agency and I hope that Ms Olive Braiden and her staff will be successful. It is of more practical compassionate import to assist women who feel that, for one reason or other, they cannot carry a pregnancy to full term than to be involved in many of the controversial issues debated inside and outside the House. It is against this background that Fine Gael has moved a reasoned amendment the main purpose of which is to give the Government additional time to reconsider the very complex issues raised, to give it the opportunity to bring forward clarification and to remove uncertainties. When the proposal was announced the Taoiseach wrote to me and said that he would provide any additional information or clarification I sought. I took up this offer and the Taoiseach replied to a series of questions I put to him, and I thank him for that. While these replies were helpful the Taoiseach will not be surprised to hear that his responses raise almost as many questions again. The topic we are dealing with is complex. It has already, in our generation, engaged the best and brightest advice available to us in this country and indeed in other jurisdictions also. It is fair to say that no one has yet found a solution which commands widespread consensus, support and respect. So far in this debate the one thing that can be said about this proposal is that it has not yet established or commanded such support or respect. I have some personal experience of this. I spoke on Second Stage of the 1983 amendment debate as the then Minister for Justice. I very specifically drew attention to the ambiguous nature of the eighth amendment. I indicated that it would have unforeseen and unforeseeable consequences. While there were those who disagreed with and criticised this view, experience indicates that what I said proved correct. I give precisely the same warning regarding this legislation. It is ambiguous and uncertain and its results are unforeseeable. It creates a new category of hybrid 'constitutional legislation'. It does violence to the fundamental balance between the institutions of Government and the courts as laid down not only under the 1937 Constitution but also under our first Constitution. This proposal is built on a foundation of corrosive mistrust. The Dáil cannot be trusted so a Bill enacted by the Dáil must be enshrined in the Constitution so that it cannot be amended in this House by reference to the people. That is basically a vote of mistrust in the Dáil itself. The courts cannot be trusted either so this legislation has to be enshrined in the Constitution so that the traditional protection which the Supreme Court gives [108]to legislation which it deems to be in accordance with the Constitution is also removed. I suggest also that the medium and long-term proposal suggests that the people themselves may not be trusted in certain circumstances. I do not believe that in the foreseeable future a substantive majority will ever favour the introduction of legalised abortion. I believe that views in the medical profession are substantially against the introduction of legalised abortion. I refer not only to the medical profession but also to those engaged in nursing and other health professionals. I fail to see from where the threat to introduce legalised abortion in this jurisdiction is coming? My main objection to the proposal is that it is riddled with uncertainty. I will examine this from the standpoint addressed by many members of the pro-life movement. The classical pro-life position protects life from the point of conception. This legislation studiously and consciously ignores the entire area of conception from fertilisation to implantation in the womb. As the Minister for Health and Children said at the launch of the proposal 'The proposals have no relevance to the unborn outside the womb.' It has always been accepted, even by opponents of Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution, that the protection afforded by it is from the moment of conception. There is no definition of unborn in the Constitution, but no one has ever cast doubt on the proposition that the intention of 40. 3.3º is to protect life from conception. The definition of abortion in the Bill before the House means 'the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of the woman'. Therefore, the protection under this proposed act given to the unborn is from implantation, not from conception. This, it seems, sets up a conflict between two subsections of the new Article 40 of the Constitution and this conflict may only be resolved by a decision, in due course, of the Supreme Court. On one hand, Article 40. 3.3º protects life from the moment of conception. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, repeated that and said that protection would not be removed. At the same time this Bill will only vindicate that right from the time of implantation. It seems that is putting a contradiction into Article 40 and the Supreme Court of the day in the future will adjudicate on that. Frankly, I cannot predict what the consequence of that adjudication will be. It surely opens a vista of uncertainty greater than the vista of uncertainty to which I brought the attention of the House when the amendment of 1983 was put before the House There is a misunderstanding about the role of the Supreme Court in respect of the proposals before the House. Because legislation is being enshrined in the Constitution the Supreme Court cannot intervene to deem it unconstitutional. This cannot be referred to the Supreme Court by the President in accordance with the provisions of Article 29, but the fact that the Supreme Court is [109]not in a position to strike down the legislation on constitutional grounds does not mean that it is not free subsequently to interpret it in just the same way as it would interpret any other section of the Constitution. This Bill, if the referendum is passed by the people, will become an integral part of Article 40 of the Constitution and be subject to the full scrutiny of the Supreme Court on a case stated, on any issue which runs from those contained in Article 40. The justification for the Government's rather odd definition of abortion seems to be to save the use of the IUD and morning after pill from legal challenge. Medical dictionaries define abortion in terms of the termination of a pregnancy before term. It is never defined in terms of the termination of a pregnancy after conception or after implantation. The same is true of normal parlance. One thinks of abortion as the termination of a pregnancy before the birth of the child – before the child goes to term.;3244571

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. Dan Wallace;Fianna Fáil;I wish to share time with Deputy O'Kennedy. This Bill provides for constitutional and legislative reform in relation to the protection of human life in pregnancy. Its proposals, which represent the first legislative response to the legal issues remaining unresolved since the X case in 1992, are fair, reasonable and compassionate. The issue of abortion is a sensitive one for society and it is heartening that the response to the proposals to date has been of a measured, mature and thoughtful nature. There has been none of the rancour that characterised the debates in 1983 and 1992. It is very important to acknowledge that the law alone cannot deal adequately with the often tragic realities of crisis pregnancy in modern society. On more than 6,500 occasions in the past year alone women giving an Irish address have had abortions in Great Britain. That is about 18 women every single day of the year. Of course many Irish women have made this journey in previous years also. The difficult circumstances faced by these women and the often lonely decision they have made demand sensitive understanding and a compassionate response from us all. We must also strive to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy by every reasonable means at our disposal. The law represents only one part of the picture. Education, advice, care and compassion are in many ways much more important. That is why a comprehensive approach is being adopted on the three different planes of Constitution, legislation and practical caring intervention. The purpose of section 3 is to provide that a medical practitioner or any other person will not be obliged to carry out a procedure to which he or she has a conscientious objection, even though it may not constitute abortion under the Bill. [538] Given that the Bill in effect simply provides legal protection for current medical practice, it is not expected that this provision will have any adverse effect on current practices. Section 4 deals with travel and information. The Bill will protect freedom to travel and the right to information in accordance with the existing provisions in the Constitution which were approved by the people in 1992. It also makes clear that a person shall not be restricted from travelling to another state on the grounds that his or her conduct there would be an offence under this Bill were it to occur in Ireland. The proposals in this Bill represent a fair and reasonable attempt to resolve the constitutional and legal difficulties that have surrounded the issue of abortion since the judgment in the X case in 1992. They are also the culmination of a lengthy and detailed process of consultation and debate. The time has come to move on from that and attempt to resolve the matter. A pregnant woman should be entitled to whatever medical treatment she may need, even where this may unavoidably place the survival of her unborn child at risk. Any legal doubt about what is permissible in such circumstances must also be removed so that doctors will be able to continue to provide the necessary treatment in accordance with established medical practice. The Irish health care system has an enviable reputation when it comes to the care of expectant mothers and their children and the proposals in this Bill will protect current practice, not change it. A constitutional provision without legislative backing would run the major risk of subsequently being interpreted by the courts in an unanticipated manner. Therefore, the method the Government has chosen is the best way to ensure that safeguards are put in place which spell out straightforwardly what is and what is not allowed. The provisions can be amended only if the people so decide in a further referendum. The proposed Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill spells out clearly and unambiguously what will be permitted under the law and describes the straightforward constitutional provisions which will govern any future amendment of the law. That means the electorate will have a clear understanding of the meaning and effect of the various provisions in advance of a referendum. The amendment is designed to acknowledge that the issue of abortion is one on which the people wish to have the final say while at the same time leaving the matter primarily in the legislative domain. The Bill will also remove any doubt there may be about the legality of treatment doctors might consider necessary where a pregnant woman suffers from certain rare, life-threatening medical conditions. It will provide certainty for doctors who may have feared that some interventions, although accepted medical practice in such circumstances, might have been unlawful. Section 1 of the Second Schedule defines 'abortion' for the purposes of the Bill as 'the [539] intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of the woman'. It provides exemption from the definition as abortion of a medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk to the woman's life other than by self-destruction. In the course of the hearing of medical evidence by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution it became very clear that in a small number of cases of strict and undeniable medical necessity intervention by doctors to safeguard the mother's life can entail or result in the ending of the life of the unborn. On reading the testimony of the all-party committee it becomes apparent that while there are differences of language and interpretation amongst members of the medical profession, their approach to the care of pregnant women and their unborn children is essentially the same. Their objective in all cases is to ensure that women receive all the medical care they need while affording maximum protection to the health of the unborn children. If the people accept the proposal, the amendment to Article 43 will have effect only if the text of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas within a period of 180 days, otherwise the amendment in its entirety is nullified. The mechanism of making a constitutional amendment conditional on a later legal development was successfully used in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The proposed constitutional changes on this occasion are designed to ensure that the legislation has a sound constitutional basis and that the careful balance it strikes will not be subject to legal challenge from either side of the argument. They are designed to reassure the people that they will be consulted if a change is proposed in the future. A 'yes' vote in the referendum on the Bill to amend the Constitution will give effect only to the constitutional amendments involved. The only way in which the terms of the legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy can become law or have any effect is through a separate, subsequent decision by the Oireachtas to enact that legislation. While it may never be possible to satisfy every point of view or to devise a solution acceptable to all, the Government has sought, by fostering a reasonable, calm and structured national debate, to develop a consensus on how the issues arising from the X case and C case judgments might finally be resolved. In 1997 the Government decided that a Green Paper on abortion would be prepared. This document was published in September 1999 and welcomed by many interested parties as a clear and balanced document, setting out as it did the history of the issues and the different arguments [540] advanced while discussing the principal constitutional and legislative options. The Government referred the Green Paper to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, for consideration. The committee embarked on a process of detailed consultation seeking submissions on the options discussed in the Green Paper. Over 100,000 submissions were received from individuals and organisations. Subsequently the committee held hearings at which the issues were explored in detail with many of those who had made submissions, including representatives of the medical profession and the churches. The committee's proceedings and its report were published in November 2000 and generally agreed to be fair, balanced and of great value in educating and informing public and political opinion. The proposals that the Government has launched give protection to the life of the unborn human. The purpose of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill is to provide for the amendment of the Constitution to state that the proposed Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill, 2001, shall be the law on abortion in the State. The amendment provides for the operation of a mechanism whereby proposed changes to Article 43 of the Constitution and the text of the proposed legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy will be put to the people in a referendum. It will also protect best medical practice and remove any doubt about the legality of treatment which doctors consider necessary in the case of rare, life-threatening conditions occurring during pregnancy. The issues have been explored in great depth before the committee. We have listened with open minds to the opinions of the people on the protection of the unborn. We have considered ways and means of advancing in a way that can command the support of all our people. I have consulted my constituents and have no doubt that the Bill, as published, is the best way forward. It is the only way forward. I have always believed strongly that the unborn child must be afforded every possible legal protection by our society and its laws. My opinion in this regard has not changed in any way during the years. As one sadly observes the level of abortion in most contemporary cultures throughout the world, a most serious question must be asked of modern day standards and priorities. The practice of abortion, to which I am opposed, is an attack on the innocent defenceless human being at a time of great vulnerability. The legislation before the House will give protection to the unborn child.;3246331

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;I regret that we have to take this legislation in the House at this stage. I do not mean this evening, but at this stage in the experience of our people. Having said that, I am implacably opposed to abortion, like so many other Members of the House. [541] I will now explain the reason I regret we have to take these steps to correct what is a totally unacceptable position. It is because of the consequences of the last referendum, the Supreme Court judgment that followed and the fact that, unfortunately, we allowed ourselves to be influenced at the time by zealous people – perhaps of good intentions – who wanted to have a constitution somewhere in the world that would actually be, as they saw it, an example of what they wanted to see in every other constitution. Unfortunately, their good intentions have given rise to very major complications, both in law and the Constitution, and not done anything to enhance the position of the unborn or, for that matter, protect the life of the mother to the maximum extent possible. I am probably the only one in the House who attended the debates in the House of Commons in 1966. I personally heard David Steele introducing his legislation at the time, the purpose of which, as he stated it, was to clean up and regulate backstreet abortions, by way of bringing them under proper medical control. It was very desirable, as seen by the British public and British parliamentarians. David Steele said on the same night that if he thought that the consequence of his Private Members' Bill would be to introduce abortion on demand, he would withdraw it. This demonstrates that when we mortals and legislators think we can tidy up matters that are very fundamental, we sometimes do the very opposite of what we intend to do. I wonder what David Steele's view now is on the intention of the Bill he introduced in a country where there is now, clearly, abortion on demand to the extent that it is also, obviously, having a major impact in Ireland. We are being told that our young women can go to England to avail of this facility, which is not available here. My wish is that we could go back to the pre-1992 days when we had a very clear position before a lobby group persuaded the Government to bring forward an extraordinarily complex and unsuitable amendment. The Government and Opposition at the time, on the front benches, clearly indicated the risks of such an extraordinary introduction into our Constitution.;3246336

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. Michael O'Kennedy;Fianna Fáil;The Deputy is quite right. The position before that year had been very clear. There was a criminal offence created under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, in respect of which people had been prosecuted and convicted. This was in a minority of cases, but the legislation was in place. The people and courts knew the position and could interpret the law as it was. In addition, it has to be said that if someone said, 'There was no particular provision in the Constitution to protect the rights of the unborn,' his or her argument would be entirely fallacious. [542] It has long been established in our judicial judgments that there are rights – unenumerated rights – that are so essential that they precede all judicial decisions. Judicial determinations have to take account of these rights. Examples of such rights are the rights to fresh air and clean water – rights that do not need to be stated in the Constitution. It is my conviction that the right to life of the unborn was clearly in that category until the zealots arrived and told us that they wanted a special provision. What was the consequence of this? The consequence – which I notice even in this Bill, about which I have reservations – was that all of us were party to a judicial determination that we had the right to travel. Imagine, in a democratic society, the need to proclaim the right to travel, particularly in this democratic society, where countless millions of our people have exercised it. Who has the right, under any circumstances, to prevent someone travelling outside the jurisdiction? If the totalitarian states of the former communist countries had introduced such an amendment, it would have made some sense in their case, because the right to travel was never available to any citizen, be they pregnant women or anyone else. As a consequence of much nonsense, we introduced the right to travel to our Constitution, a provision about which I still have reservations as it is totally unnecessary. Believe it or not, we have another right, the right to information. Is anyone suggesting that, in a democracy such as ours, there is not the right to information? Do we also have to write it into the Constitution? I regret, for the reasons I have just stated, the need to discuss and enact the legislation before us. Having said that, it is about the best that can be done to attempt to correct the mistakes we have made as a consequence of making unnecessary concessions. As I said, I am implacably opposed to abortion. The legal advice given to those who saw their opportunity and their right to create what they saw as an absolutely foolproof legal provision was wrong. I will not listen to any of them now presenting themselves as legal experts, a point to which I will return. Some of them still hold views as to when life begins revolving around definitions of implantation and conception. It is very important that what we do is done within our scope and competence. The Bill, imperfect though it is, is about the most perfect instrument we can introduce at this stage to correct what is a very confusing and unsatisfactory situation. Those who now present themselves as medical or legal experts – some present themselves as both – are walking on the head of a pin in relation to the distinction between implantation and conception—;3246339

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. John Bruton;Fine Gael;This is a subject on which people hold, and in a democracy are entitled to hold, fundamentally divergent positions based on different value systems. It will never be possible to devise legal formulae that reconcile fundamentally different value systems so the key is to be tolerant, to respect the opinions of others but without being afraid to proclaim one's own. In my contribution, I will explain why the Government should accept the Fine Gael amendment, explore some of the suggested defects in this Bill and how they could be put right, explain why it is essential that those who reject the Bill totally be required to table their own alternative proposals and try to deal with how the philosophy of human rights applies to this case – when does a child become human and when does it acquire human rights. The Government may be making a mistake in introducing this Bill so late in the life of this Dáil. It is always easier in a hasty referendum to get people to vote No. People can be persuaded, often wrongly, that if they vote No, nothing changes. This will be very wrong in this case. A No vote in this referendum is likely to change everything and that is why the Taoiseach's strategy is risky. A second No vote to an alteration of the X case judgment would create greater pressure on the Dáil to introduce substantive legislation to permit abortion in the circumstances of the X case, namely where there is a probability of a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother from her own hand. Such legislation would raise many difficulties but these difficulties are not now on the table, are not now being debated and the people are not aware of them. The jurisprudence of the X case allows for abortion to take place at any time up to birth. As has been stated by a leading psychiatrist, John Sheehan, there is no fail-safe way of saying or testing whether a person will commit suicide. The British Rowlinson inquiry said that to perform an abortion on this psychiatric ground was not only questionable in terms of compliance with the law but put women at risk of suffering a psychiatric disturbance after abortion. Psychiatrists would not want to be the blame-takers under such legislation for a political decision or, [544] indeed, for a decision of the people. This is clear from the testimony of Dr. Anthony Clare, quoted earlier in the debate. These problems will become very obvious if legislation to implement the terms of the judgment in the X case were tabled but they are invisible now. People are not seeing the whole picture, only the criticisms of the present proposal. That is why there is wisdom in the reasoned amendment put forward by Deputy Gay Mitchell. The three months delay proposed by him would allow those in this House who do not favour the Government's proposals and who want to vote against them the time to come forward with their own proposals. These alternatives could then be rigorously tested in debate alongside the Government's proposals. At the moment, it is only necessary for critics to criticise. A big advantage of the Fine Gael approach is that a three months delay would allow the crisis pregnancy agency to be fully operational before the Dáil finishes its work on this Bill and to be making a real impact before the people vote in the referendum. This must be done urgently in any event but it would create a much more positive atmosphere for the decision and it would reduce the risk of misinformation and unanswered questions inducing people who might otherwise like to vote 'yes', to vote 'no'. The Taoiseach should know by now how difficult it is to get people to vote 'yes' in any referendum. He tried to adopt a fairly hands-off approach to Nice and we are only now beginning to experience the problems that has caused for this country. I was intrigued to hear Deputy Conor Lenihan say in regard to the referendum on the Bill that in this case politicians should not canvass vigorously or aggressively. That is code for saying that he is not going to canvass at all. If that happens and if others follow him, then there will certainly be a 'no' majority to the Government's proposals. This is another argument for the more deliberate approach suggested by Deputy Gay Mitchell. It will give us time to ensure that the key values issues at stake are not unnecessarily clouded by avoidable technical questions. Many voters are so busy nowadays that they only focus on a referendum question in the last seven days before polling. The scope for scare tactics during that time frame is enormous. That is why maximum public political testing of any Bill and of its opponent's alternatives should take place before the matter is put to the people. The Government is making a mistake and is compounding that mistake today. This issue is a difficult one. We are dealing with two lives, the life of the mother and the life of a child in the womb. Both are alive but one is someone we know, someone to whom we can speak, someone for whom we can feel, someone we may love. The other person remains almost an abstraction and we use abstract words like 'foetus' and 'unborn'– as if all of us in this House were the undead – to describe this life. Yet it is a life and [545] a life that has human rights, a life with great potential. I studied the contributions of all the Members to this debate. Deputy Shatter asked with great sense why nothing had been done in the past four years to make adoption, as an alternative to abortion, more attractive. I agree with him. That could have been addressed by the Government and the Taoiseach in the past four years and it could be addressed in the next three months if Deputy Mitchell's proposal was accepted. In many contributions, a tolerance was shown towards speakers with other viewpoints. Deputy O'Sullivan, in particular, said that although she did not share their opinion, she genuinely respected the view of people who feel the threat of suicide could be used by somebody who wanted an abortion for a reason the majority of Irish people would feel inappropriate. Other Deputies, however, suggested that to even hold such a view was 'not to trust women'. The difficulty here is that any law other than one based on the woman being free to chose abortion without any constraint is one which could be attacked on that ground – of not trusting women. Any abortion law other than one based on abortion on demand would involve professionals, some of whom are likely to be men, making judgments about whether a woman who wants an abortion should be allowed to have one. That problem is not peculiar to this Bill. A number of Deputies said that as a result of this Bill, a woman's life will no longer be equal to that of the foetus. This statement is not correct. In the case of medical risk, the legislation seems, quite rightly, to give priority to the life of the mother over the life of the child in the womb. If a threatened suicide were to be a ground for abortion, there is a possibility that the threat might be fulfilled. If, however, an abortion takes place in those circumstances, there is not a possibility but an absolute certainty that the life of the child in the womb will be ended. A concern has been expressed that the Bill will give a blank cheque to the medical profession in ethical matters. I doubt if this is true. The Constitution is read as a whole by the courts and I do not believe that the medical profession could interpret the provision of this Bill in a fashion that runs counter to Article 43. 3 which remains in the Constitution and which is merely supplemented by this new article. If this fear of a blank cheque is genuine, then the medical circumstances where a termination is to be permitted could be explicitly listed in the Bill. Any Deputy who has that fear has the obligation to put forward such an amendment. Likewise, if, as some Deputies believe, there are concerns about unregistered medical practitioners conducting abortions under the Bill or about either unduly restrictive or unduly liberal lists of places at which terminations may take place being provided for by ministerial regulation under the Bill, then those concerns too should be addressed by introducing greater certainty by means of amend[546] ments. Those who make those criticisms have an obligation to put forward such amendments. Some might say introducing such amendments would introduce too much detail indirectly into the Constitution and would be too inflexible. If that is their view, they cannot at the same time then complain that the proposal is uncertain. In all law-making, there is always a trade off between detail and flexibility. The more detail one has, the less flexibility and the less detail, the more flexibility. It is as simple as that. In any event, the Oireachtas, contrary to the view of some speakers in this debate, has a right to intervene and introduce further amendments to this legislation after it has been adopted by the people. The only restriction is that these amendments would have to be approved by the people in a referendum. Given that we have had a number of constitutional referenda in recent times, that is not an insurmountable obstacle. Some argue against the proposal on grounds that it is riddled with uncertainty. Others say that introducing detailed legislation is cumbersome and unnecessary. Although one speaker seemed to adopt both points of view in the course of his speech, both positions simply cannot be true. If we want certainty, we must have detail. If we want detail, we must have legislation. If we want legislation to alter an existing Supreme Court decision, that legislation must amend the Constitution. It is that simple. The Government will not withdraw this Bill. Members and each voter will eventually be faced with a decision. It is our job to offer them the best possible one. The Government's guillotine approach is not a good idea. The suggestion made by Deputy Quinn on the Order of Business is a good one and will allow the type of debate needed. Legislation to give effect to the X case is not the way to go. It would leave the life of an unborn child dependant on a subjective judgment taken by a mother in extremely stressful conditions, a judgment which might be bitterly regretted. Such legislation might provide for one, two or three psychiatrists to sign certificates but the only certainty is that when all is done the child will no longer be in the womb, the child will be dead. That is a hard and hurtful thing to say but it is, unfortunately, true. It is a certainty, not a possibility. Such legislation would definitely end one life without necessarily saving the other. I do not believe the potential weaknesses of legislation to implement the X case can be remedied by skilled drafting. The fundamentally subjective nature of the suicide risk makes that impossible. This brings me back to human rights considerations. There is a United Nations declaration on human rights. As a nation with a written Constitution, we pride ourselves on the protection we give to human rights and we promote them throughout the world. How does the concept of human rights apply to this Bill? What are the human rights of the mother? Is the child in the womb human? If it is not human, what is it? If it is human, is its human right to life to be pro[547] tected by law or are all its human rights to be entirely dependant on the decision of its mother in all circumstances? This is the core issue. Is a human right something intrinsic or is a human right something that is only granted to someone who can speak up for themselves, someone who can go to court? A child in the womb cannot go to court. That child is entirely dependant on someone else acting on its behalf. I believe human rights are intrinsic and are not dependant on one being able to go to court. I further believe that State involvement in human rights issues is justified precisely because some human rights cannot be left to people taking private legal actions. If the State is to be involved in human rights at all, then surely it must protect, above all others, the right to life. Without that right, all other human rights cannot be exercised. That is why I say this issue goes to the heart of our concept of human rights. Furthermore – and this is important – the extent to which the State should protect a human right should be greater the less the ability of the person concerned to protect his or her rights. That is common sense. The child in the womb cannot go to court to protect its rights. This brings one on to the next question. Is the child in the womb human and is it therefore entitled to human rights protection? We all know from medical and psychological studies that the child can feel pain. We know that what happens to the child in the womb can influence its future life not only medically but also psychologically. This is already recognised in civil law in all jurisdictions. The victims of thalidomide had their human rights vindicated on the basis of things that happened to them before they were born. It is clear, therefore, that we are human before we are born. If our Constitution deals with human rights at all, it should extend to those as yet unborn. I do not agree, therefore, with the revisionist assertion that we could have got away in the longer term with having a Constitution that protected the right to life of the born but not the unborn. The courts sooner or later would have been forced to the conclusion that the child in the womb is human and is therefore entitled to constitutional human rights protection, if such exists. Some argue it is hypocritical to provide constitutional protection for the unborn life while allowing or even encouraging women to travel freely to Britain thereby dumping our problem on another country. I accept fully that the pressure for abortion here would have been much more intense if Britain were located 600 miles away rather than 60 miles. At the end of the day we must do what we believe is right whether Britain is 60, 600 or 6,000 miles away. That is what self Government is about. Surely no one is suggesting that in order not to be accused of hypocrisy we should copy British law in all matters so that Irish people can travel to Britain to avail of British law. [548] The Government's proposals deserve to be seriously debated with serious alternatives and amendments put forward. The electorate are too mature, too well educated for politicians to make each-way bets on this issue. To those who will say the Government's proposals must be rejected, I repeat my challenge: come forward with your own proposals come forward with your own legislation to deal with the difficult cases mentioned – suicide, rape, incest, poverty, job loss, mental illness and say then how those proposals are reconciled with your concept of human rights, the human rights of women and the child in the womb. The people can, then, begin to make a real judgment.;3246342

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;F;Ms. Mary Harney;Fianna Fáil;Over the past four years, the Government has engaged in a long and complex process to consider all sides of the issues related to abortion, medical interventions in the course of pregnancy and the protection of human life. This process was designed to facilitate a full reflection on all aspects of the issue. It served that purpose well. It involved the production of a Green Paper, extensive hearings by the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on abortion and the production of its comprehensive report, and many months of work by a Cabinet committee examining achievable options for a way forward. The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution and the contents of the Protection of Human Life Bill are the culmination of the Government's detailed consideration of all the issues of the past four years. We embarked on the process in a legislative vacuum in respect of current medical practice where the only statute on abortion remained the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. There was also a background of failed constitutional referenda – the failure of the 1983 referendum to work as its promoters expected and the failure of the proposed and simplistic wording on the substantive issue in 1992. The courts were the only arm of the State making law on the matter. It was well past time for the Government and the Oireachtas, to bring forward a workable proposal, a modest step forward that would put a woman's relationship with her doctor at the centre of the issue and ensure legal protection for medical interventions in pregnancy. The process of deliberation was designed to build consensus around as many of the issues as possible. It has proved very valuable in creating the conditions in which this House and the public at large can debate the issues in a fully informed way, calmly and without rancour. By and large that has been the tone of the debate in this House so far. The Progressive Democrats in Government agree to this proposal being put to the Oireachtas and to the public for debate. The deliberative process helped us form our views on a proposition that would be capable of gaining acceptance from the people. We were also very mindful [549] of the developments of the Medical Council in relation to its ethical guidelines particularly its decision last September which brought an additional degree of clarity to these issues for medical practitioners. We paid particular attention to the evidence heard at the all-party committee regarding the risk of suicide for women during pregnancy. This arose in the context of whether and how we could legislate effectively for the circumstances of the X case without giving rise to undesired results. Psychiatrists who gave evidence to the all-party committee said it was impossible to predict reliably if someone was likely to commit suicide, especially if a pregnant woman was refused an abortion. Professor Anthony Clare said, 'No such statement can be made with any great safety.' Dr. John Sheehan of the Rotunda Hospital said: There is no test or in a sense there is no fail safe way of saying the person will or will not commit suicide. It actually doesn't exist. Representatives of the Well Woman Centre commented in their evidence on the possibility of legislating for the circumstances of the X case, and stated there were 'immense difficulties involved in defining parameters for such legislation.' They added: We are aware that it is almost impossible to define medical criteria which would not in time lead de facto to a liberal abortion regime to which we would be opposed, and we would indicate that some other jurisdictions have found that the only practical way was to define a term limit or a time limit at which abortion should be permitted, and this was a model to point to. The logic of their analysis is clear. The question is whether it can be applied in practice, constitutionally or politically, in Ireland. We must recognise that current constitutional provisions preclude any abortion law based on time limits or term of pregnancy. That is the reality of our starting point for amending the law. As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has stated, we are not starting with a greenfield site constitutionally. We are governing in the context of the existing Article 40. 3.3º of the Constitution. Those who want a liberal abortion regime or the many who would permit abortion in the case of rape or incest must recognise that their chosen position requires a constitutional amendment to reverse the 1983 referendum and the provisions of Article 40. 3.3º. If they were in government, they would have to assess whether their proposal had any chance of receiving the assent of the people in a referendum. In 1986 the people roundly defeated a proposition to introduce divorce in Ireland. Ten years later a modest and conservative divorce regime was put to the people and narrowly adopted. We are not in a greenfield site, constitutionally or politically. We are governing and making law [550] in the context of realities today. This includes the experiences of many thousands of Irish women who have chosen abortion. Their experiences and choices must inform our approach to the issue. We must show sensitivity to women who have chosen and will choose abortion. It is never a choice lightly taken. There is a wide range of views among the people on these issues and this creates practical political limitations on what will be democratically accepted. This limitation has been seen very clearly in trying to deal with the issue by way of a simple constitutional formula in a referendum. Clearly, the Constitution contemplates scenarios in which the people's sovereignty in law-making should be expressed via referenda rather than wholly through the Oireachtas. The Progressive Democrats have been against the approach of dealing with the complexities of the abortion issue by way of simple constitutional formulae. I am pleased to say the Government has rejected this approach. The proposal the Government has brought forward is fundamentally legislative with the addition that the people will be allowed give their assent or otherwise to the legislation directly, as many wish to do. The Government's proposal is a modest, incremental step forward. The Bill places the relationship between a woman and her doctor at the centre of legislation, unlike the existing Offences Against the Person Act and the failed substantive amendment in 1992 and other constitutional formulae that have been proposed. It is a significant advance on current statute law in the area by removing any legal doubts about current medical practice. Dr. Peter McKenna, Master of the Rotunda Hospital, referred to this in an article he wrote recently for The Irish Times: The most obvious benefit in this Bill from a gynaecologist's point of view is that a seriously ill mother can now be offered a termination of pregnancy in this State if it is done to save her life. This is a very rare event and when it was done in the past there was genuine doubt in the minds of practitioners whether they were breaking the law. To know with certainty that recognised medical practice is legal is a considerable comfort for these very unusual cases. If I understood his article correctly, this was fundamentally the reason he said he would support the proposal, albeit with reservations. Under the Government's proposal a woman will receive all necessary medical treatment indicated by her doctor and agreed by her during pregnancy. Doctors will have more certainty. Women will have more confidence that their doctor-patient relationship cannot be interfered with by third parties seeking to make legal or constitutional points in the absence of clear law on the issues. The Bill also creates legal certainty for the position of the morning after pill and the use of intra-uterine devices. It was not sufficient to regulate the availability of the morning after pill solely by virtue of licensing decisions of the [551] Irish Medicines Board acting in the context of inadequate statute law on the matter. Some argue that we should leave things as they are with no change in statute law. This position would accept that the entirety of statute law relating to medical interventions for women in pregnancy, the protection of human life and abortion should be as stated in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861. It is entirely inadequate to leave a 140 year old, 19th century statute stand as the only legislation on these matters. For example, that law includes the penalty of life imprisonment for a woman who has an abortion in Ireland. Political indecision and inertia would continue to leave it as the status quo. Any reasonable person contrasting that law with the proposal the Government has brought forward will recognise that we are proposing a considerable advance in statute law for women and their doctors. The proposal envisages a referendum being arranged in order that the people can directly give their assent or otherwise. I have stated in the House before and it remains my view that it would be unwise to proceed finally to a referendum unless sufficiently broad, middle ground support for the proposition is apparent. This proposition has the potential to earn such support if we proceed with a reasonable debate and the issues are well understood by the public. The Progressive Democrats have called for a mature, calm and reasonable debate on the issue. I am glad to say the debate in the House this year has been much more along these lines than in previous years, especially 1983 and 1992. Unfortunately, there have been exceptions, on both sides. The issue has been deliberately politicised by some. Do they believe they advance the cause of women by this attitude? Does any Deputy believe this behaviour advances the legal position for the doctor-woman medical relationship? Some seem determined to make the issue divisive, despite the public distaste there is for divisiveness and rancour on this issue. I reject this approach which says it is impossible to debate these issues calmly and maturely between people who hold differing views. Let us be clear that there are many honestly held, differing views about the issues at stake in this debate. There is a wide range of views within my party. I would not have it otherwise. I would not seek to impose uniformity in any area of conscience and it has never been a tradition of the Progressive Democrats to do so. I do not claim that this proposal would be the first choice of all members of my party. This is a difficult issue for many who place a great value on individual freedoms and rights. Deputies from other parties will recognise that there is a diversity of views within their parties. To pretend otherwise would be to fly in the face of the facts of which Members and the public are well aware. This proposal represents an advance for women and their medical needs in pregnancy. [552] After four years of consultations, from the Green Paper to the Oireachtas committee, including 110,000 submissions and the valued evidence of the medical profession, we have arrived at a considered and finely balanced compromise. In all the circumstances, political and practical, it was the judgment of the Progressive Democrats in government that this was worth proceeding with in the Oireachtas and in public debate with a view towards a referendum if sufficiently broad middle ground support was generated for it.;3246343

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. Ruairí Quinn;The Labour Party;Nine years ago the current Tánaiste told the House her views and those of her party on abortion. Abortion she said, was: the lesser of two evils where a woman's life is at risk, where her health is seriously at risk, or if somebody has been raped or the subject of a sexual crime such as incest. It is also the lesser of two evils where somebody may take their own life. In these limited circumstances – and they are limited – the option of terminating a pregnancy should be available to Irish women in Ireland. I agree with the Tánaiste's views as set out nine years ago. They are humane and focus on the person. They are not extreme and represent a liberal mainstream perspective on this difficult issue. I do not know how we have reached a position in which the Tánaiste is prepared to support a referendum to repeal the Supreme Court decision in the X case. I asked the Tánaiste this question on the Order of Business recently and she was unable to answer it. Sadly, her contribution has failed to yield an answer. If the Tánaiste had been genuinely converted to the position being proposed by the Government I would understand. However, I suspect that is not the case. What I do know is what the Tánaiste would say if I were in her position proposing this amendment. She would talk of tragedy and betrayals. She would accuse me of being anti-woman. She would accuse me of abandoning any liberal principles I ever held. She would occupy the moral high ground like the Progressive Democrats of old. If our positions were reversed, she would be right. She is guilty, sadly, of all these things. It is for the Tánaiste to justify her own position on these matters, but I will say one thing to her. She should not seek to justify what she has done or recover lost ground by playing politics with the timing of this referendum. That genie is unfortunately out of the bottle. Nor should she attempt the hypocrisy of seeking to oppose the referendum that she has deemed appropriate to put before the people. She cannot have it both ways. Nor should she suggest or intimate that consensus should be sought on the issue. She more than anybody else knows that there will be no consensus on a referendum to repeal the X case decision. The Tánaiste has at least come before the House to make her current position known. I hope that the Taoiseach will also contribute to this debate. He certainly should do so. However, [553] he lacks the Tánaiste's courage and it is clear he will not come before the House this evening. The referendum will take place because the Taoiseach wishes it. I suspect it is a political calculation on his part. He was never greatly associated with this issue prior to seeking the highest office in the land. Unlike the Tánaiste, he has no track record of speaking out on this issue because, I suspect, it is too controversial and divisive. People being present in the House during debates has been the subject of some comment in the media in recent weeks. I have been the subject of some criticism myself. However, what applies to those of us in Opposition should also apply to the Taoiseach – the man who instigated this referendum. The Taoiseach's obligation extends further than taking part in this debate. If there is any sincerity in what the Taoiseach is seeking to do here I expect him to campaign hard on the issues involved. If he really believes that 'social abortion' is the threat he claims it to be he should make his view clear to the people at every opportunity. Let them tell him how wrong he is. Of course, the Taoiseach has no great track record of campaigning as such. Like his party he sat out most of the serious constitutional changes of our generation. His sitting out referendum campaigns extends beyond those campaigns that have defined the liberal and social agenda. The Taoiseach is the only political leader who refuses to campaign effectively on issues not just those chosen by others, but those initiated by himself. He certainly did not campaign with any rigour in favour of the Nice treaty referendum, despite informing us that he had secured a great victory over the French Government during the negotiations. In fact, he is quicker to give interviews after soccer internationals in which the national team has been successful than he is after the defeat of referendum proposals supposedly sponsored by his own Government. Perhaps matters will be different on this occasion. As the Taoiseach tours the country advocating his referendum, as he must, I hope he will explain to people why he feels it necessary to bully and marginalise the tiny minority of young women such as Miss X and Miss C whose pregnancies led to such personal crises that suicide was a real and persistent threat. However, it could it be that the Taoiseach is so cynical he is satisfied that in merely proposing this referendum he has discharged his political obligations and is in a position to collect his political rewards. For the sake of politics, I hope not. Make no mistake about it the X case and the C case are the net issues in this referendum. They are the only reason the Constitution needs to be amended. Everything else being proposed by the Government, some of which I support, can be done without a referendum. Do the people wish to repeal the Supreme Court decision in the X case? Do they wish to reverse a decision they made clearly in the 1992 [554] referendum? Do they accept the diminution in the equal right to life of the woman? Do they accept that we should distinguish in our laws and in our Constitution between the physical and psychological threat to the life of a woman? I do not believe so. The majority of the people will never again see this as a simple yes or no issue. I do not believe they will forget how they felt in 1992. Parents, in particular, recall how they felt when they pictured their own daughters in the same position as Miss X and Miss C. They hoped and prayed that they would never find themselves in the same position. They understood implicitly the crises of others. They were parents from all over the country, from rural and urban areas, young and old, of all faiths, church going and non-church going. This is not a so-called 'Dublin 4' issue, it touches every corner of this land and every community. Let us acknowledge that this is an issue that affects women and their rights in particular. I firmly believe women will not accept any proposals that accord them less rights than they are currently afforded by the Supreme Court decision in the X case. Women will not accept a constitutional amendment that says they cannot be trusted. They will no longer accept the status of second-class citizens. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste publicly requested a measured debate on the issues involved in this referendum. It is a call I support. However, let there be no confusion – a measured debate and a search for consensus are not the same thing. One is possible, the other is not. Unfortunately, the message was certainly not heeded by the Taoiseach's own backbenchers. Some have made measured contributions which, while I disagree with, I respect. Others sadly have not. It is not solely Fianna Fáil backbenchers who are responsible. In response to legal criticisms of the Government's proposals from my party, partisan briefing material emanated from the Taoiseach's office. While we are informed that the Taoiseach sought to withdraw the document, it had clearly entered circulation before he was able to do so. Worse was to follow. During the course of this debate, one Fianna Fáil member in particular made scurrilous charges against members of the Fine Gael Party before proceeding to insult Irish women in general. Where the Taoiseach sought to give a lead, some members of his own party have decided not to follow. My party's objections to the legal device being used to put this referendum before the people are already clear and in the public domain. We believe we are correct. We believe also that we are correct on the issue of European protocols. We further believe that should this referendum be passed, the new article will clearly impact upon the interpretation of Article 40. 3.3. Legally flawed though it is, however, my objection to this referendum is not about legalities. I simply do not believe that the decision in the X case should be reversed. For that reason we will campaign [555] against this referendum, whenever it is put to the people. Abortion is a serious issue. It will cause many people to look deep into their hearts and consciences. Those who trouble themselves sufficiently to consider the issue and vote are people who think deeply and have strong, but different views, on the society in which they live. It is possible that people of divergent views will vote against the Government's proposals. They will represent a sizeable majority at the end of the day. However, these people – and I speak as one of them – are not 'zealots' as one newspaper unfortunately described them.;3246344

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. Ruairí Quinn;The Labour Party;That charge, made in an editorial in The Irish Times is particularly ironic, given the position adopted by that newspaper in the referendum on precisely the same issue in 1992. I ask that the charge be withdrawn because it is not worthy of those who made it and it is not deserved by those on both sides against whom it was levelled. I welcome the Minister for Health and Children to the House. The Minister was not present when we argued about the next stage of this legislation. It will follow a restricted Committee Stage, subject to a guillotine. The Minister might explain why he broke a promise he made earlier in a document that he circulated to Members. It stated that there would be a full debate in this Chamber to enable all Members to articulate their concerns. It was the subject of intense discussion earlier today and it requires a clear justification as to why the Minister broke his word. It may well be that this is collective responsibility and that the Cabinet decided that there would be a particularly restrictive manner for taking Committee Stage. Much of the detail in this legislation will not be subject to the kind of scrutiny that is required because many Deputies will not be able to contribute. More importantly, this will be the first constitutional legislation where Committee Stage was not taken on the floor of the House. The record should show why the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Dauphin of the Fianna Fáil party, sought to change precedent in relation to this matter. What had the Minister to hide? What was the Minister afraid of?;3246346

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. Ruairí Quinn;The Labour Party;What was he afraid of that he was not prepared to take the debate on the floor of this House? There is no sense of urgency about the legislative programme of this administration. The Minister waltzes in and out of the House to discuss legislation. The House does not sit late and will not come back in January even though the timetable for the House has now been altered [556] and the budget takes place in December. The reason for the delay in not coming back until the end of January was, in the past, to enable the budget preparations to be concluded over the Christmas period. There is no such constraint on us now. If the Taoiseach wanted to give this House the time that he says he wants to give, and not guillotine legislation by shoving it off into a restricted Committee Stage, we could come back on 10 January. There is an onus on the Minister to answer on this issue to this House, to the wider public who will read this debate and to the thousands of women whose rights he is restricting and whose access to safety is being stripped away if they are suicidal. The Minister is not forced to do this. If he disagrees, he can choose another course. Does the Minister for Health and Children believe that there is a difference in health terms between physical and psychological health? Surely after two years in office the Minister should realise that the threat to life from a psychiatric illness or psychological condition is as real as a physical one. These are questions that women will want the Minister to answer. They will want to ask him and every Fianna Fáil candidate why their sisters and mothers have a reduced right to life as a result of this proposition. There is an alternative course of action, to abandon the referendum and bring in legislation to give effect to the judgment in the X case. That is the position of the Labour Party. We should not need another divisive referendum because we have already spoken on this issue. I agree in part with what the Tánaiste has said. However, a referendum of this kind could only be on the basis that on this issue the politicians of all parties cannot be trusted. Any legislative change that we may wish to make that would be enacted in part with this constitutional amendment will have to be subject to the approval of the people by way of plebiscite. The Minister must explain that. This is a sad day for Ireland. This is the fifth attempt to deal with this issue. As Deputy O'Kennedy said, the original proposal was wrong-headed in the first instance. The only party still in this House today which opposed it at that time was the Labour Party. It is to Deputy Dick Spring's credit that, in his first weekend as leader of the Labour Party, he opposed that particular proposal. It was that wrong-headed constitutional amendment that has brought us to this position. I appeal to the Minister not to go down in history as the Minister for Health and Children who minimised the safety of the lives of women in this country.;3246348

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. Micheál Martin;Fianna Fáil;I thank Deputies who contributed. I acknowledge that the subject matter is sensitive for many people. The tone of the debate has been marked by a great understanding of the difficulties faced by women with a crisis pregnancy and sympathy for them. However, there is a degree of arrogance [557] in suggesting that we should not go back to the people on this subject. Clearly, as we said when we launched this proposal, there are many views on the issue. We are endeavouring to bring forward a balanced set of proposals that will command the majority of the middle ground of reasonable opinion. No successive Government has come forward with a set of proposals that are perfect, ideal or meet everyone's particular concerns. However, at the sub-committee there was a strong view that we should go back to the people. Others, including the Labour Party, have a different view. They are entitled to that view but let us not be arrogant by saying that the view that the legislators should not go back to the people is the only one. There are many legislators who believe that, to an extent, this represents unfinished business because of earlier situations in the 1980s and early 1990s when we went to the people. The present legal position is not acceptable. It is not ideal for medical practitioners, women or unborn children.;3246349

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protecti;20.11.01;M;Mr. Micheál Martin;Fianna Fáil;There are differences of opinion as to whether we should go back to the people on this issue. A wide range of issues have been raised in the course of the debate. Many of these are grounded in genuine concern about the possible impact of the Government's proposals on the health of women and their unborn children. In other cases, Members have questioned the Government's approach without clearly indicating what approach they would adopt or where they stand on the key issues. This Bill, and the mechanisms for which it provides, represent the first legislative response to the legal issues which remain unresolved since the X case in 1992. It will protect best medical practice, while providing for a legislative prohibition on abortion and underpinning such legislation with an amendment to the Constitution. The Government is satisfied, on the basis of all of the expert medical evidence which has been presented and discussed, that there are rare life-threatening conditions or illnesses, either associated with pregnancy or exacerbated by pregnancy, in which in order to save the woman's life, it may be necessary for doctors to consider taking action in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended. In this legislation, under the proposed Act, a threat of suicide will not constitute a real and substantial risk to a woman's life. There was much debate on this in the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I will comment briefly on some of the main issues raised on this Stage of the debate. Several Deputies have expressed concern about the ruling out of a threat of suicide as grounds for an abortion. They have suggested that a possible risk to the life of a pregnant woman is measurable and capable of assessment in the same way as a life-threatening physical condition. It has also been [558] suggested that the Government's proposals call into question the professional expertise and judgment of psychiatrists. The evidence heard by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution shows that psychiatrists have highlighted the great difficulty of assessing whether a threat of suicide will actually be carried out. The Government, having considered the testimony and other research in this area, considers that it would not be appropriate to provide for a regime where abortion would be permissible on grounds of threatened suicide. Some Deputies have asked why the envisaged legislation will protect unborn life only from the time of implantation in the womb rather than from fertilisation. There has been considerable debate outside the House on that issue. In the first place, this legislation is concerned with the protection of human life in the womb and ensuring an effective prohibition on abortion. At the same time the Government wants to ensure that there is no doubt about the legality of a medical procedure necessary to save a woman's life. This is the first legislative proposal to provide specifically for that. Article 40. 3.3 of the Constitution will remain in place. I recognise that, as a matter of personal conscience, there are people who believe that human life begins as soon as the ovum is fertilised. However, there are difficulties with providing in law for the protection of the unborn from this point. For example, for practical purposes it is not possible to tell at the time of fertilisation that this has occurred and medical research suggests that many fertilised ova do not implant in the womb at all. Medically it is only possible some days after implantation to diagnose that a woman is pregnant. The Bill in essence defines the offence of abortion, and not the issue of the beginning of human life. Therefore, the proposed legislation takes the time of implantation as the point beyond which unborn human life can be protected under the law, as it is from that point that pregnancy can be established as having begun. As regards issues such as in vitro fertilisation and embryo research, I established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction which has been asked to consider and prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining policy in this area. The commission is chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly and has been meeting for the past nine to 12 months. The Government will consider these issues when the commission makes its report. A number of Deputies raised concerns about the mechanism for making ministerial orders provided for in section 5 of the Bill. The first point to be made about these orders is that they involve putting in place new arrangements, but with the objective of protecting existing best medical practice. At the moment, a procedure of the type covered by section 1(2) can take place in any location and can be performed by any medical [559] practitioner. The threat to the woman's life may include a threat of self destruction and there are no specific legal requirements regarding what constitutes a reasonable opinion on the part of the doctor concerned. I am not aware that those who expressed concerns about the possible abuse or distortion of the mechanism provided for in the Bill have said that existing arrangements are inadequate and that safeguards are necessary. Nonetheless, in light of the views expressed during this debate, I will consider whether there is scope for improving the parliamentary scrutiny mechanism regarding the making of ministerial orders. Concerns that, by introducing safeguards, the way may be opened to a so-called liberal abortion regime, are unfounded. It must be remembered that the key test in any case is whether the medical procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the medical practitioner involved, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of the loss of the woman's life, other than by self-destruction. Furthermore, the medical practitioner must have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life where practicable. The constitutional underpinning of the legislation and the requirement that any proposed amendment of it must be put to the people in a further referendum mean that there must be a degree of flexibility to amend the arrangements for the approval of certain places for the purposes of the Act, for example, if at some time in the future, new hospitals are opened or existing hospitals are amalgamated. For practical, routine reasons the ministerial orders make clear and common sense and the provision for parliamentary scrutiny of ministerial orders will provide an additional safeguard. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency which I recently established represents the first serious attempt by any Government to provide comprehensively for women faced with crisis pregnancies in terms of resources and realistic options, advice and guidance.;3246351

My understanding is that the orders were laid before the House, but Deputy Mitchell has asked for some opportunity to debate them. I have no difficulty with that request. Many people have commented on the nature of this debate. We have been endeavouring to reach a consensus on this issue. The Oireachtas committee put forward three options. The Labour Party has been consistent since then in its opposition to rolling back the judgment in the X case. The committee offered other significant positions that we do nothing and that we move in this direction. We will not achieve 100% agreement on this issue. The Labour Party has taken a clear position, as have the Government parties. Fine Gael is not happy with the mechanism which is wishes to contest before getting into the content of the proposal and how to assess it. From the legal work which has been put into this issue, and in my capacity as chairman of the interdepartmental committee, I am satisfied this is well crafted legislation into which much thought has gone and that it stands up to any scrutiny in terms of its legality or constitutionality. Many independent commentators have articulated this view in the media. There has been an unprecedented level of debate on this issue in the House. No other legislation has been debated at such length so it is somewhat unfair to suggest that a guillotine has been placed on the Bill. Likewise, the Bill will be debated by the sub-committee on health and children and will have to come back to the House on Report Stage.;3246358

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;M;Mr. Michael Noonan;Fine Gael;We oppose the motion. We got a commitment from the Taoiseach that all Stages of the Bill would be taken in plenary session. We know also that the precedent for discussing Bills which involve amendments to the Constitution is that they are taken in plenary session in the House. We also object to the fact that we did not have full information today when the Order of Business was announced by the Taoiseach. A Supplementary Order Paper was subsequently circulated and the information on it was an expansion of the information available when the Taoiseach announced the Order of Business. We are concerned about the provisions for debate in committee. We not only object to this Bill being referred to the committee but also to the provisions in committee. The Dáil is being asked to agree that Committee Stage will begin on Thursday of this week and that it must conclude at 6 p. m. on Thursday week, 29 November. Late last week on the Order of Business the Taoiseach told me the principal reason he wanted this Bill taken in committee rather than in plenary session in the House was that it might take up to eight days of continual committee work. Deputies' diaries are already full, yet a committee of this House is being asked to confine its debate of this issue to seven calendar days. I understand the proposal from the Minister for Health and Children is that the committee will meet on Thursday and Friday of this week and then conclude the following Thursday. The Taoiseach said earlier today on the Order of Business that there is nothing to preclude the committee from meeting for the full seven days until midnight any night. With respect to the House and to the Taoiseach, that is an unreal proposition. The Taoiseach knows the Houses cannot be accessed on Saturday and Sunday, which are two days of the seven days. People, including those serving on this committee, have other arrangements made. The Taoiseach should also be aware that many Members of this House want to exercise the right to attend and speak at the committee, although they are not members of it. They also have arrangements made for Thursday and Friday. [565] This is a deliberate proposal by the Minister for Health and Children and the Government to obviate the democratic process in the House to carry out one of its principal functions, to put forward a proposal to amend the Constitution. Any amendment to the Constitution is serious. An amendment to the Constitution on this issue is particularly serious because it is an amendment to Article 40 of the Constitution which is one of the principal Articles that deals with personal rights under the Constitution, particularly the right to life. We often get involved in hyperbole and say that certain issues are a matter of life and death. However, the blunt fact of this proposal is that it is a matter of life and death. It is an attempt to re-balance the right to life of a mother and child. That is the nub of this proposal. It is a re-balancing of those rights. We are actually talking about matters of life and death and yet the Taoiseach, once more, breaks a solemn commitment to the House by not taking this Bill in plenary session. It is being put into a committee where Members will be prevented from debating it properly, where only members of the select committee may vote on it and not all groups are represented on the select committee. Contrary to precedent when a constitutional matter was being debated when every effort was made to involve everybody in the House and ensure that the elected representatives of the people had the full right to openly debate an amendment before it was put to the people, on this occasion precedent is being broken once more. This is a disgraceful proposition. We have had guillotine motions before but I have never seen anything like this. I will make one final point on procedure. When the Taoiseach was challenged on the Order of Business today, he quoted the precedents of the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill. I have carried the Finance Bill on Committee Stage in Opposition for several years with the Taoiseach involved with Ray MacSharry and Deputy Albert Reynolds. I would challenge anybody in this House who sat on that committee to say that it is satisfactory. What happens always is that there is a time motion for the debate on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and votes are rolled up at the end of every section and the bulk of amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies are not debated at all and if they are debated they are certainly not voted on separately. There is always a vote at the end and it is governed by the procedures where the chairman reads out a motion stating that only amendments in the name of the Minister may be put and it will be decided at the end of the section, when the time motion clicks in, by one vote. That is not a precedent which is relevant to an amendment to the Constitution. That is a precedent which is done under time constraints with the very tight calendar of a Finance Bill. In circumstances where the House in one place or other, and the [566] public in one way or other, have been speaking about this issue for the past four and a half years, what is the dirty hurry that involves Committee Stage being drummed through by next Thursday evening? What is this about? I ask the Taoiseach, in the interests of democracy, because he has always been open to the argument of Opposition when it comes to debate and procedure in the House and has always been generous in the procedures he has put before the House when rational arguments are made to him, to accept the proposal by Deputy Quinn today. Let us come back here in early January. It will not affect procedures or the process of other legislation. Let us come back on 10 January and let us debate this issue for two weeks in plenary session and give an opportunity to everybody. Let us not divide the House unnecessarily on this motion by driving this Bill into a committee where justice will not be done to this amendment and certainly justice will not be done to democracy in this House or outside.;3246365

Too many voices have been muffled, unheard and silenced. On the issue of abortion we cannot have the same muzzling of views occurring in the approach being adopted by the Government. I ask the Taoiseach to restore the honour of the Government and ensure the honour of the House by living up to a promise made by the Government that the Committee Stage debate would be held in this Chamber so that all Members could participate. The only way he can restore the honour of the Government, having betrayed the trust of Members and broken a promise to Members, is to ensure that Committee Stage is taken in the Chamber with all Members given the right to participate in our national Parliament. What concerns us greatly is that when the Bill was published setting out the proposal for a referendum the Taoiseach said he wanted to find a consensus. Yet when it is clear the Government is running scared, far from finding a consensus it has to confront genuine criticisms and genuine concerns from different quarters all of whom I respect. He is in a position where he is leading a Government that is running scared. That is why there is a guillotine this evening on Second Stage. That is why the Bill is being fast-tracked and coming to Committee Stage this Thursday. The attempt is being made by the Taoiseach to have it put through Committee Stage, against a promise made by the Minister for Health and Children, and completed by the following Thursday. He is trying to bury it in the bowels of this building and trying to ensure the debate is minimised rather than maximised. [567] The Second Supplementary Order Paper clearly indicated the Government was trying to ensure Opposition amendments could not be put on Committee Stage. The Taoiseach has back-tracked on that at least.;3246366

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;F;Ms. Liz McManus;Democratic Left;I have the floor. I will not be silenced by anybody on this issue. I am expressing views on what is being put forward by the Government and I accept the protection you provide so that I can finish my statement. The Labour Party wants to ensure full debate. This is all we are seeking. We recognise this is a constitutional referendum. This is not a small matter of a small Bill that can be processed without any great problem through the House. We would have no difficulty with that. We are not doing this for some obscure reason, we are doing it for the universal reason that the Constitution belongs to everybody. When there is a proposal to change the Constitution, the least we can do is ensure a full debate and ensure the different views on this referendum proposal are recorded so that when the citizens of the State come to make their decision they can see clearly what the views were and that they were recorded in a way that they can have. It may be, given the delays in this House in terms of committees, that we may not have the record of the committee proceedings in time for a referendum. What kind of information is that providing? I remind the Taoiseach when it came to the Nice Treaty the overriding reason people either did not vote—;3246368

The debate we are seeking to have in this Chamber as opposed to a committee made up of a small number of representatives of this House is about life and death. It is not a small matter. It is a matter of life and death that affects young women. There are few women in this Chamber. We are a handful here. We should not be a handful because we make up more than half the population but that is the way things are. I have a bounden duty to ensure the voice of women can be heard and listened to when it comes to a debate of this importance. Deputies: Hear, hear.;3246370

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;F;Ms. Liz McManus;Democratic Left;I would draw the Taoiseach's attention to the point made by Deputy Howlin that there are minorities in this Chamber who will not have their views heard if a decision is made to hive the Bill off to a committee. There are Independent Deputies here and small parties. [568] They have articulated the view many times that they do not get a fair share. They will not get any share at all in respect of the debate on Committee Stage if the Government persists on the route of trying to bury discussion and debate on this important matter. When the Minister for Health and Children was asked a few minutes ago the reason he was breaking his word and not living up to his promise to ensure the debate would be held in the Chamber I suspect he had forgotten he made that promise. I also suspect he had forgotten the Attorney General's written statement that this was what was envisaged. It is important we remind him those were the words of the Attorney General. It was envisaged that Committee Stage would be held in the Chamber and that all Members would be entitled to be involved in that debate, but we are not getting that. One of my privileges is that I am a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution. I am not a lawyer. Before I was elected to the House I did not know anything about the law or the Constitution, apart from a superficial knowledge as an outsider to the procedures of the House on which we are commenting. I have, however, learned a great deal about the importance of not unduly interfering with the Constitution and damaging it. Strong legal and constitutional arguments need to be made about what the Government is proposing, quite apart from the rights and wrongs in relation to women. The rights and wrongs in relation to the Constitution must be the subject of Committee Stage, which must be taken in the Chamber to ensure we do no harm, not only to women, but the Constitution. I am fearful that when it comes to the end of this process we will not have restored the honour of the House because the Taoiseach, in particular, is not willing to maintain the honour of his Government, live up to his promise and commitment and can be seen only as a leader of a Government which is running scared.

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;M;Mr. John Gormley;Green Party;I will be brief. The Green Party will oppose this motion. I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. When I put the question, 'where would Committee Stage be taken?' to the chairman of that committee, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, he told me clearly that it would be taken on the floor of the House because it was a constitutional amendment. Those were his words which echo those of the Attorney General and the Minister. It is unprecedented that a constitutional amendment would not be debated in the House. I have only been a Member for four and a half years, but those who have been Members longer can tell me this is the case. What we heard this afternoon was typical obfuscation by the Taoiseach who went around the houses. I remember the famous words put to another Deputy in the House about being a waffler, but the real waffler this afternoon was the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach is trying to stifle debate and undermine democracy. He is trying to facilitate the Progressive Democrats who are trying to hide on this issue.

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;M;Mr. Jim O'Keeffe;Fine Gael;By a remarkable coincidence, tomorrow at 1 p. m. the all-party committee on the Constitution will launch a report. That report will be on the referendum, the issue under discussion. It is agreed by all parties in the House and was prepared under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Lenihan. That agreed report includes the following four sentences: The process is important in the case of the Bill to amend the Constitution, the fundamental law of the State. Consequently, measures should be taken to ensure that a Bill to amend the Constitution is fully debated by the Dáil. Given the importance of a constitutional amendment, every Deputy and every Senator should have the opportunity to express his or her views. The Bill, therefore, should be debated in principle and in detail by each House. [571] That is the view of the all-party committee, representing all Members of the House. I ask the Taoiseach the reason is he now rejecting this approach.;3246396

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;M;Mr. Gay Mitchell;Fine Gael;Deputy Noonan has made the case on this matter and I want to make a few more points. The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 is the title given to the Bill, but as the explanatory memorandum states, if passed by the people, it will come back to the House as the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2002. In other words, it is not intended that this Bill be dealt with until next year. That is a very relevant point. The earliest that a constitutional amendment referendum can be held is the spring of next year – I understand the Taoiseach had pencilled in February or March for that referendum. I do not understand why this matter is being rushed. I said on Second Stage – I hope my comments will be seen as measured, reasonable, fair and balanced – that I did not understand why a press conference was hurriedly called and why the Bill was announced with such speed. I do not understand why it is being rushed through this House. I do not understand in particular why we are not taking Committee Stage on the floor of this House. I gave an understanding to all my Fine Gael colleagues that that would be the case. I want to make one other practical point. I am trying to draft amendments between the votes in this House and the public engagement I have in another county later this evening so they will be ready before 11 o'clock in the morning.;3246397

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;M;Mr. Gay Mitchell;Fine Gael;Neither the Fine Gael Front Bench nor my parliamentary party colleagues have seen them. That means that I will have to draft amendments, some of which I might not agree with in total, to take account of the views expressed to me. This is not creating consensus across the floor of the House on some of the contents of the Bill, nor is it giving to Deputies on this side, who have been sympathetic to a reasoned debate, the opportunity to participate in that reasoned debate. I forecast that this is the start of the defeat of this Bill when it goes to the people. The people will see this as a sleight of hand. The whole procedure being used here is wrong. It is not right to take the Bill off the floor of the House in this way when an undertaking has been given. It is not right that the Fine Gael Front Bench, the major Opposition party, and the parliamentary party have not seen the amendments to this constitutional Bill, which I am supposed to put down by 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. [572] I have to ask two questions. Is the Taoiseach fearful that the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and others will not go up to the lobbies and vote if the Bill is on the floor of the House? Is that the reason for this? There are no Progressive Democrats Deputies in the select committee to which the Bill is being referred? I can only presume it is some reason of that kind. Is there some date in early December by which the Bill has to be passed so that some other body outside this House can pronounce on it once it has passed through the Oireachtas? Why is the Bill being rushed through the House?;3246399

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;M;Mr. Gay Mitchell;Fine Gael;This is an important matter. I said during Second Stage that we would give this Bill consideration and quiet disquisition. I challenge anybody in this House to say that anything I said on this issue in any debate inside or outside this House was not reasoned and fair, but how can we continue to treat this as reasonable and fair if it is being drummed through the House in this way.

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;I want to make a few brief points. The proposal before the House now is not merely a subversion of democracy but is undermining the solemn constitutional role of this Dáil in considering in detail specific proposals to amend the Constitution. I have been a Member of this House since 1981. I was here for the debates on the 1983 referendum and the debates on the 1992 referendum, and I recall participating in the Committee Stage debates on all the proposals related to this issue. It is the first occasion when a debate on this issue, in the context of a proposal for a constitutional amendment, is sought to be confined by Government to members of a select committee. It is the first time on this issue that has happened. There are Members of this House who wish to exercise their constitutional obligations to participate in this debate. There are Members of this House who regard it as their public duty to tease out in detailed form the specific implications of the proposal the Government has brought before the House. Those who will vote outside this House on this proposal, should a referendum take place, are entitled to know of the detail of the debates that take place. Each Deputy in this House is entitled to participate if they wish to do so. The room in which the Select Committee on Health and Children will operate will not remotely have the capacity to accommodate the Members of this House from the major parties, the smaller parties and Independents who may wish to participate. I also believe there are Members on the Government side, who are not Ministers or members of the health and children [573] committee, who may wish to participate in that debate and who will have something to offer, in the public interest, in their participation in the debate. In practical terms, this proposal is closing the door on that possibility. The very physical design of the committee rooms will exclude the possibility of any substantial number of Members of this House, who are not members of the health and children committee, participating in the debate should they wish to do so. More importantly, they are excluded from voting on Committee Stage on the basis of what is proposed. I will conclude by making two points. First, I listened with interest to the various interviews and read the various articles written by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about the importance of Members of this House acting as legislators and fulfilling their duties as legislators.;3246402
2094;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: Ord&uacute do Ch&eacute im an Choiste.

Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of;20.11.01;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;The Minister has sought to make his political reputation on having some commitment to the reform of the workings of this House and to allowing Deputies, as legislators, to play a meaningful role. Did the Minister for the Environment and Local Government go along with this proposal? Is this an example of how the Government believes we should reform the workings of this House to allow its Members on all sides participate as legislators? I do not believe the Government will have credibility in the future when it talks about Dáil reform and the needs in that area. Second, if the Progressive Democrats, as a party, was on this side of the House and this proposal came from the Government, the level of moral indignation we would all be subjected to would be so thunderous that it would leave those in the Chamber with serious headaches from which they would have to try to recover. The Progressive Democrats has turned the name of its party on its head, to the regressive democrats. This is a regressive proposal in addressing a serious constitutional issue in respect of which the Progressive Democrats has done a substantial U-turn. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, this is not about ensuring proper debate on the issue. This proposal procedurally is to provide the Progressive Democrats with a hideaway to avoid the embarrassment of confronting amendments that may be proposed to this legislation which would make it very clear that it is now adopting an approach which is the exact opposite to the approach adopted by it in this House in 1992. If the Government has the courage of its convictions that this proposal is all it says it is, it should debate it in the full Chamber of this House, in the glare of publicity, and allow the [574] debate to take place that should take place in a parliamentary democracy with a written Constitution in circumstances where it is proposed to make a fundamental amendment not only to that Constitution but to the manner in which this Parliament does its business.;3246404

Deputy McManus spoke very eloquently on behalf of my party, but everybody else who has spoken on this side of the House was equally eloquent. The Taoiseach cannot see the expressions on the faces of his backbenchers, but I assure him they agree with the sentiments being expressed. I want to formally put a proposal to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste as I believe this is a partnership Government. Earlier today I suggested that the Dáil should resume on 10 January. That happens to be a Thursday, which means we could come back on 8 January, or on a date to be agreed by the Whips. The Taoiseach's legislative programme will not be put at risk. We have the time in January to do the things that must be done, listening to what has been said. As Deputy O'Keeffe said, the All-party Committee on the Constitution, the basic document of this Republic, states clearly how we should make changes to this legislation and that it should be done here. I realise there are legislative commitments and priorities between now and Christmas that make the idea of having the Bill on the floor of this House for seven or eight days a proposition that would disrupt other issues, but a commitment was given by the Minister for Health and Children in the document he circulated and by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe that the debate would be held here. If it cannot be held before Christmas, we will have time after Christmas without disrupting the Government's legislative programme. Will the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach indicate whether they are prepared, at this late stage, to accept this proposal which, I believe, has the support of this side of the House.;3246405

2175;Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001: Motion to Recommit.;04.12.01;F;Ms. Liz McManus;Democratic Left;I would be delighted to do so, and I understand that under Standing Orders I have a right to make an explanatory statement. I am moving this motion because Members of this House who have not had a chance to debate the Bill, because it was referred to a committee of the House, should understand the importance of this amendment to the Constitution. It is unique and unprecedented in that what is being proposed by the Government is, in effect, to put legislation in the Constitution. It is being done in a way that is legally and constitutionally suspect, and it is being done with an approach that is impossible to understand. The Taoiseach made it clear that it is unlikely that the referendum will be held prior to February, yet the Government is determined to steam-roll this legislation through the House. I do not know if it is to make sure that the Bill is completed before the bishops meet in the next ten days to two weeks, but something is putting tremendous pressure on the Government to make it insist on guillotining the Bill on Second Stage, even though not all Members of the House had an opportunity to speak on it. When Committee Stage was taken by the Committee on Health and Children a guillotine was again imposed by the Government, even though less than half the amendments tabled had been debated. A raft of amendments was not discussed in any shape or form on Committee Stage. Now a further guillotine is being imposed on Report Stage, the only opportunity Members have to debate a very important amendment to the Constitution. The Government has adopted an extraordinary and unnecessary position. There is no good reason for its approach. We need to be aware – A Cheann Comhairle this will interest you – that there is a real and pressing danger that what we are doing may damage the Constitution. We should also be concerned that the issue the amendment deals with relates to a matter of life or death for Irish women. In effect, what it proposes to do is remove the right to life which Irish women currently enjoy under the Constitution. We are, therefore, addressing a deeply important issue. The approach also flies in the face of the recommendations of the all-party committee on the Constitution which recently produced a report on how referendums should be managed [857] and processed both in terms of this House and of informing the public. We all know the last referendum was, as described in the research attendant to the report, an unhappy experience for Irish people. People were not fully informed and went to the polls in a very confused state. This was shown by all the research related to the Nice treaty referendum. The all-party committee on the Constitution recommended there should be a change in Standing Orders. With regard to drawing up legislation to propose an amendment to the Constitution, the report proposes to amend the Standing Orders of each House to embody a presumption that every TD and Senator will have sufficient opportunity to make whatever contribution he or she wishes to make. The consensus of the committee, which met under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Brian Lenihan, was that this process is particularly important when a constitutional amendment is being dealt with and that a referendum is something exceptional. A referendum is not ordinary legislation because it deals with matters of life and death. It is most extraordinary that the Government is trying to incorporate the amendment into the Constitution to ensure that, no matter how flawed it might be, it can only be changed by a vote of the people. We will lose our right as legislators to exercise influence or deal with these flaws. We have a Minister who is objecting to a recommital of the Bill which would ensure all amendments are dealt with and all Members of the House can speak. I was impressed that so many members of the Opposition spoke forcefully and eloquently about the deficiencies of this Bill on Committee Stage, even though the meeting took place in the bowels of this building. The same cannot be said of the Government. The silence of the vast majority of Fianna Fáil Deputies and all the Progressive Democrats' Deputies was notable. We have to ensure that a Bill of this type is fully scrutinised in this House so that when it is put to the people no one can argue that due process was not carried through. We clearly have a problem. Rather than allowing due parliamentary process, the Government is mindlessly and ruthlessly driving this through the House as if the devils in hell were pursuing it. What is the urgency? Surely amendments to change the Constitution should be subject to full scrutiny to ensure it is good, sound legislation. If we can no longer feel secure that we can do the work for which we are paid, there is a serious threat to the way in which the Constitution is protected, the way this House deals with legislation [858] and, most particularly, the way in which the lives of women are protected. This is the reason I tabled the motion, not to delay, but to take the correct approach to ensure we have prepared the ground, in line with recommendations of the all-party committee on the Constitution, for whatever referendum proposal emerges at the end of the process.;3252538

Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pre;04.12.01;M;Mr. Micheál Martin;Fianna Fáil;The difficulty is that the Deputies did not accept the answers or the arguments. There is a difference between getting answers and agreeing with them. In a democracy people are entitled to different perspectives. I restate that the term 'in particular' when used in the proposed Article 40. 3.4º makes it clear that the statute envisaged by the amend[867] ment is not intended to be a restatement of the term 'unborn' as used in Article 40. 3.3º. As I explained on Committee Stage, when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court must follow the well established principle of harmonious interpretation. In other words, constitutional provisions should not be construed in isolation from all other parts of the Constitution, among which they are embedded, but should be so construed as to harmonise with other parts of the Constitution. Therefore, neither of these articles can be regarded as taking precedence over the other they must be construed together. Deputy McManus has tabled amendment No. 4 and Deputy Mitchell amendment No. 5 on this issue. Deputy Mitchell drew attention to the use of language in Article 40. 3.4º as opposed to the language used in Article 40. 3.3º. I strongly reject the questions raised by him that the use of the word 'protect' in any way weakens the protection of the unborn. It does not. We did not set out in this proposal to define when human life begins. We are defining the act or crime of abortion. We are providing a modern statute in terms of the crime of abortion. We are referring to the intentional destruction of the baby after implantation in the womb. We made this very clear on Committee Stage. We went through all the details and defined implantation in terms of the process involved. It was teased out in some detail. Deputy Mitchell made an erroneous deduction as to the reason the word 'protect' was inserted and we did not use the word 'defend', which is already included in Article 40. 3.3º. As Articles 40. 3.3º and 40. 3.4º will be read together, there is no necessity to insert those words into Article 40. 3.4.º However, the deduction he made that we would be restrained in what we could do in the legislation unless we used this particular form of language in the article itself is not correct. That was certainly not the purpose of the subsequent language used in the legislation. The Bill does not reduce the protection of the unborn. I take Deputy Mitchell's point made on Committee Stage that not much emphasis was placed on the dimension of the unborn in the debate. I said that myself towards the end of Committee Stage, but that is a function of those who contributed to the debate. Deputy John Bruton came in at one stage and raised it.;3252552

I move amendment No. 1: In page 4, to delete lines 14 to 20. I apologise for not being here when I was called. It was not taken in this order the last day. The reason I tabled this amendment is to give me an opportunity to test further the case of the Mini[861] ster in relation to the content of the First Schedule to the Bill about which on Committee Stage I raised some of my concerns. It is set out on page 7 of the Bill and deals with a section beginning with the words 'in particular'. Different emphases have been put on these words by different people and the Minister has given the House to understand that they do not have any great importance. It seems that they have greater importance than he suggests because this will be inserted as Article 40. 3.4º and preceding it will be the statement that the right to life of the unborn is to be vindicated and defended – not just protected. This general statement followed by the words 'in particular' implies that Article 40. 3.4º will be subject to Article 40. 3.3º. However, an alternative reading could be that this is not the case at all. Looking at the words, 'In particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002', it can be seen that it is much weaker than what is contained in Article 40. 3.3º which states that the right to life of the unborn in the womb, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, shall be defended and vindicated. It states, 'The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.' The proposed amendment seems to be, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, a reduction in the protection for the unborn. As Article 40. 3.3º is drafted, there seems to be a fine balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn, but whereas much emphasis has been put on the implications of the X case for the mother, we have not put enough emphasis during the debate on the implications of the amendment for the unborn. We need to draw this out and be specific and clear about it. Anybody reading or listening to this debate should know the implications before they cast their vote if the Bill is passed and the question is put to the people. Deputy Dukes said on Committee Stage that he thought all this could be done with legislation. I disagreed, thinking that this section could contravene Article 40. 3.3º and ought to be dealt with by a constitutional amendment in order that any legislation could not be judged to be in contravention of Article 40. 3.3º. Since then, however, I have spoken to senior counsel and it seems that Deputy Dukes may have been correct. A case could be made for doing this with ordinary legislation, although I do not know whether it would stand up to a challenge. The Minister could not do what he wanted to do in the Second Schedule, that is, to define abortion as a crime – after implantation in the womb of the mother – without this reduction in protection for the unborn. I wonder why he did not use the same words as are used in Article 40. 3.3º. [862] Why, in this case, is it a question of the unborn in the womb only being protected, as against being vindicated and defended, as far as practicable, by law? If this was introduced simply as a law, would we be capable of doing this? The Minister has not answered this question to my satisfaction. I ask him to go into it in some detail. Is he reducing protection for the unborn? The Minister has been talking about the harmonious interpretation of the Constitution, that doctrine which is followed by the High Court and the Supreme Court. If Article 40. 3.4º were passed, a future High Court or Supreme Court considering a challenge would take into account all the provisions of the Bill. It seems that, for example, under Article 40. 3.3º, notwithstanding the passing of this, it might still be possible for a future Government to bring forward legislation to ban the morning-after pill on the basis that it is an abortifacient, even though the Minister said during his contribution that it was a contraceptive. On the other hand, a future Supreme Court, using this doctrine of harmonious interpretation in a challenge concerning, for example, stem cell research or research on the embryo could interpret Article 40. 3.4º as permitting this sort of research which has been giving rise to much concern and to report on which the Minister has quite rightly established an expert group. We need to be clear on this. I would like the Minister to revisit the words 'in particular' and tell us precisely the reason that formula is being used. Those words have been included deliberately and by design. He should also explain to us about the protection of the unborn in the womb. Would this more specific expression of Article 40. 3.3º in fact reduce protection for the unborn? The Bill is entitled the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. However, the First Schedule deals with the name of the Bill to be put before the House following approval by the people, that is, the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill, 2002. Since it is and has been clear all along that this will be a 2002 Bill, I do not understand the reason we have been in such a mad rush to get it through the House and the reason the Fine Gael proposal for time to consider it was not agreed. Even taking two or three months we could still have put the question to the people in the spring which I understand is the intention. The Minister did not answer this question when I raised it on Committee Stage so I will ask it now. It is a simple question. In terms of the criminal offence provisions in this Bill, when does the clock of life begin to run? I believe human life begins at conception. I have no difficulty in saying that. As one of my colleagues said to me recently, even an atheist scientist would probably confirm that. It is nothing to do with religious belief although most Members would be influenced by that. The criminal offence of abortion being provided for in 1(1) of the Schedule is not the same as that which exists in the Offences Against the [863] Person Act, 1861, which talks about procuring a miscarriage. I ask the Minister to address the question of this case and tell us when the clock of life begins. When does the offence start? Implantation is not defined in the definition section of the Bill so when is it an offence and what evidence would be required to show implantation had taken place? This Schedule gives rise to pro-life concerns but I do not wish to go over the top about them. My job as counsel for the prosecution, so to speak, is to test the weaknesses in the Bill. I note that many of the contributions have centred on the X case and in particular on the concerns of the mother and that is quite right. I am equally concerned. Article 40. 3.3º does hone the balance there but it would be wrong to proceed with this debate and to look at all the arguments for and against this amendment without equally testing the Minister's case for the effect this legislation and amendment would have on the rights of the unborn. We are entitled to know this clearly. I would prefer that the Minister spell this out and that it not be left to some referendum commission to put the case for and against, as thought up by lawyers. The Minister has put the Bill together with the advice of a number of people so he is in a good position to advise the House on these matters. It is something we will require detailed answers for if the Bill is passed and put to the people. It is in everybody's interest that the Minister clearly indicate in reply to my questions his response to the issues I have raised. On Committee Stage the Minister said he would come back to me on the latter part of the First Schedule where it deals with the law containing only the provisions set out in the Second Schedule's Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Act, 2001. If it is carried 'this section, other than the amendment of Article 40 of this Constitution effected thereby, shall be omitted from every official text of this Constitution published thereafter'. As a matter of interest and technicality, will the Minister confirm that a full text of the Constitution with all amendments is available to Members and the public? Is a copy kept in the Attorney General's office or the Chief Parliamentary Counsel's office? The Minister should explain that to us so that we are informed. Whereas the wording that will be passed will be seen by us now it will not appear in future drafts of the Constitution. I understand why it would not because with all the amendments made through the years the Constitution would be unreadable but is there a kind of master version of the Constitution, with all the amendments intact, kept some place?;3252554

Once there is a written constitution that is amended, at a later stage it is subject to interpretation. That is a fact of life and the nature of having a written constitution.

He asked whether there would be any form of the Constitution, in which all the amendments proposed in the Bill will continue to appear even after the passage of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill. There is provision in the Constitution for this. The text of the Bill, when enacted, will be enrolled in the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 25. 4.5º of the Constitution which states: As soon as may be after the signature and promulgation of a Bill as a law, the text of such law which was signed by the President or, where the President has signed the text of such law in each of the official languages, both the signed texts shall be enrolled for record in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and the text, or both the texts, so enrolled shall be conclusive evidence of the provisions of such law. In relation to the text of the Constitution, Article 25. 5 states: It shall be lawful for the Taoiseach, from time to time as occasion appears to him to require, to cause to be prepared under his supervision a text (in both the official languages) of this Constitution as then in force [869] embodying all amendments theretofore made therein. A copy of every text so prepared, when authenticated by the signatures of the Taoiseach and the Chief Justice, shall be signed by the President and shall be enrolled for record in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court. The copy so signed and enrolled which is for the time being the latest text so prepared shall, upon such enrolment, be conclusive evidence of this Constitution as at the date of such enrolment and shall for that purpose supersede all texts of this Constitution of which copies were previously so enrolled.;3252564
2202;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Tuarasc&aacute il. Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pre;04.12.01;F;Ms. Liz McManus;Democratic Left;We should be grateful to Deputy Mitchell for putting forward this amendment because it is a matter of concern which Deputies felt was not fully addressed when raised on Committee Stage. The relationship between Article [864] 40. 3.3º and the proposed Article 40. 3.4º is an issue at the heart of which is the fact that there is possible conflict between the two. It is ambiguous because we have an article of the Constitution being retained and a new section being proposed which is different in certain respects even though it relates to the same issue – the right to life of the unborn. That difference between the two could give rise to litigation and difficulties of interpretation if this proposal is incorporated in the Constitution. If anything, the wording in the Bill highlights and is a signpost to this difficulty because the Minister himself refers to it by starting Article 40. 3.4º with the words 'in particular'. It says 'In particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002.' Those words 'in particular' are defining that this section of the Constitution, if it is added to the Constitution by the people, is different to Article 40. 3.3º in some way. It seems obvious that is correct particularly if that wording is included. If the words were 'notwithstanding the existing Article' it would be more logical and comprehensible. I can understand why the Government does not propose to remove Article 40. 3.3º as there would be political difficulties with that. It would open quite a can of worms in terms of controversy. We have an article in the Constitution which states clearly the right to life of the unborn and of the mother and that has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include where there is a risk to suicide. What the Minister is now proposing is the addition of Article 40. 3.4º which says something else. It says 'In particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act.' Let us take the issue of the unborn first. It was dealt with by Deputy Mitchell but it is worth repeating. There is no definition in Article 40. 3.3º that says it is only the unborn in the womb that is protected. When we look at the actual provisions of the Bill itself we see a further restriction on the definition because it refers to abortion as meaning 'the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation'. So we have a series of qualifications being presented. At the same time, the original article, which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court, stands. When we look at the issue in relation to the right to life of the mother it is clear in Article 40. 3.3º, which is already part of the Constitution, that 'The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.' Mothers have a protection and right to life at the moment and that has been interpreted to include where there is a risk of suicide on which the Supreme Court was asked to make a judgment because of the [865] tragic X case, where a young girl was suicidal and prevented from having an abortion. The Supreme Court made it clear that its interpretation included a risk of suicide. Mr. Justice O'Flaherty stated clearly that, in his view, the law protected women and that that was the current position on the risk of suicide. This proposal deliberately removes that protection. There is no ambiguity in the Bill. Those who drafted it are not hiding what they do, but state in the Second Schedule that abortion does not include the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which, or as a result of which, unborn human life is ended, where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction. The words 'other than by self-destruction' form the kernel of the Bill and require a referendum. This indicates to me – I am reasonably intelligent, although I have no legal training – that there is a conflict between what is being proposed in Article 40. 3.4º and what is already provided for in the Constitution in Article 40. 3.3º. I received legal advice which stated: The words 'in particular' at the start of Article 40. 3.4º are particularly difficult to interpret. Do they mean that the unborn can continue to have protection beyond that offered in the Act, or do they limit the protection of the unborn to that offered in the Act? These words imply that Article 40. 3.4º may be incompatible with the existing Article 40. 3.3º. In relation to Article 40. 3.4º, it may also be incompatible with Article 40. 3.3º for the reason that it makes no reference to the equal right to life of the mother, nor is any reference made in the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, to the right to life of the mother. Yet Article 40. 3.3º clearly provides that the State must have due regard to the mother's life. Limiting the right to life of the mother by ruling out suicide as a ground on which her right to life may take priority over that of the unborn appears fundamentally incompatible with the protection for her right to life under Article 40. 3.3º. It is thus very likely that, even if passed, Article 40. 3.4º will give rise to significant litigation issues as it is difficult to see how this inconsistency between Article 40. 3.3º and Article 40. 3.4º can be overcome given the wording of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002. In 1992 Deputy O'Malley said it was unnecessary to remove from the Constitution the risk of suicide as being a risk to a woman's life when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, proposed it. He gave the example of an anorexic girl who was brutally raped and pregnant but could not travel and was suicidal as a result of her experience. He stated even though it was exceptional, unusual and rare, such a case could arise. Everyone [866] thought the X case was extraordinary, and when in 1983 many of us argued against putting this matter in the Constitution, those on the other side of the argument argued that such exceptional cases would not arise. We know now that not only was there the X case, but the C case also. If the case of the anorexic girl, described by Deputy O'Malley, was argued in court as her having protection for her own right to life under Article 40. 3.3º, which will still be in the Constitution after this referendum, would her right to life be protected as it must be under that article, or would it be denied under Article 40. 3.4º? We must foresee this. There is a certain validity in the Government's stating the courts have been left to interpret these matters, but this is hard to accept when there is this essential ambiguity to be decided upon by them. The Minister may say that these two sections will be read in harmony. We all want harmony, and would all like to see harmony on this issue, but that would be too ambitious. We cannot simply answer this question by saying that the two must be read in harmony because they are not in harmony. That is the difficulty. There may be a new argument presented which was not made on Committee Stage, but one cannot read something which is contradictory in a way that will undo this. Words on a page are words on a page. One cannot make them into something else by any drafting sleight of hand. A lack of logic will remain no matter how they are read. This is not a sufficient answer to explain how one part of the Constitution would provide for the right to life of the unborn while another would provide for the qualified right to life of the unborn, so long as it is in the womb after plantation. Article 40. 3.3º would provide for the right to life of the mother, but there would be no such right in Article 40. 3.4º because it would exclude the risk of suicide. The people were asked this question in 1992 and did not remove the risk of suicide in respect of the right to life. If the question is put to them again, I suspect because of how society has moved on, the answer is even less likely to be to remove a woman's right to life.;3252565

Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pre;04.12.01;M;Mr. Gay Mitchell;Fine Gael;I do not know if I can do this in two minutes, but I understand I can come back in any event. Articles 40 to 44, which will be amended yet again if these proposals go through, deal with personal rights under the overall heading 'Fundamental Rights.' Article 41 states: 'All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.' It goes on to state: 'This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.' Interestingly enough, the Bill defines a woman as a 'female person.' I presume a man means a 'male person.' Since all citizens as human persons shall be held equal before the law and we have a definition for a woman and de facto for a man, why do we not have a definition for the unborn? There is no definition in Article 40. 3.3º. There is no mention of conception. There is no definition for implantation. There certainly is no definition for the unborn. Under these fundamental rights, where we speak about human persons, I presume the Minister would agree that the Constitution, in Article 40. 3.3º in particular, sees the unborn as a human person, which has certain rights. If that is the case, why is there no definition in the Bill for the unborn? There is a definition for a woman to which I will come back. The Minister claims he has answered all the questions. This is the fourth time I have asked him when the clock of life starts in relation to the offence of abortion and he has not answered me directly. I can understand he may have difficulty in doing so, but the wording as proposed does change the definition of the crime of abortion from that contained in the 1861 Act, which is to procure a miscarriage. The Minister should tell us more clearly his thinking in changing that definition.;3252567

Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pre;04.12.01;F;Ms. Liz McManus;Democratic Left;I revert to the individual case to which I was referring in order to get clarity. I would not ask the Minister to take on the role of [870] the Supreme Court. If a child went to court, could that person argue under Article 40. 3.3º that they had a right to life, including a right to life where there is a risk of suicide since that is included in the Constitution, or would that person be prevented from doing so on the basis that Article 40. 3.4º states something different? Is it the case that one does not lose the right already enshrined in Article 40. 3.3º since it is established and interpreted by the Supreme Court, although a subsection of another article in the Constitution states something else?;3252568
2206;An Bille um an gC&uacute igi&uacute Leas&uacute is Fiche ar an mBunreacht (Beatha Dhaonna le linn Toirchis a Chosaint), 2001: An Tuarasc&aacute il. Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pre;04.12.01;M;Mr. Jim O'Keeffe;Fine Gael;We are getting to the core of the issue which confronts us. We are talking about the definition and the need to be utterly transparent with the people. We are proposing to put before the people a proposal to change the Constitution. It is essential that the people fully understand the import and the impact of that change. I sat through the all-party committee hearings for approximately six weeks and it was instructive to hear the different views. It taught me about the enormous complexity of the issue with which we were dealing. There is an old saying that where there is a complex problem, one can provide a simple solution. However, that does not work. If there is a complex problem, one must be clear that there is not a simple answer to it. If an issue is put before the people, they are in a position of being judge and jury. If a case is before the courts and a jury, it is important that there is a full explanation of the issues to allow the jury to come to a decision in the full knowledge of all those issues. I am concerned about the present proposal because the people do not understand what the Minister is trying to do. The people are not engaged in the debate and they do not fully understand the proposal. That is the worst possible way to present it to the people for their decision. There are many reasons they do not fully understand it. Part of the reason for the lack of engagement is that they do not fully understand the issue. I do not decry the Minister's efforts, but they have not worked. Part of the problem is the lack of a definition, as Deputy Gay Mitchell said. There are different definitions for the same issue, even for the term 'abortion'. We found out during the committee hearings that the word abortion was defined differently from the medical point of view – different medics had different definitions – and from the legal point of view. There was not a legal definition of abortion, although people relied on the 1861 Act in the past. The committee heard theological evidence, but again there were different views. The difficulty now is that there is further confusion about abortion because of the different treatment of the unborn, which is also undefined, from conception to implantation and thereafter. It is difficult, if not impossible, for many people who were brought up believing that the moment of life began at conception to accept that there [871] should be a difference in the treatment of this issue before and after implantation. My understanding, although I am not a medical expert, is that there is a period of 14 days on average between conception and implantation. I think I understand what the Minister is trying to do, but the public does not. Many people will not accept that there should be a distinction or the Minister's reason for that distinction. That is one of the principal issues which will cause the Minister difficulty in having this proposal accepted by the people. At the other end of the spectrum there is the difficulty in terms of the threat of self-destruction. That issue has not been fully clarified for the people. I accept that before the committee hearings the evidence we had was that pregnancy reduced the possibility of suicide. On the other hand, the evidence before the committee was that it was rare even when a therapeutic intervention was carried out for physical reasons. The evidence from the masters of the three maternity hospitals was that it only occurred a few times a year. Those who said that suicide was not a factor did not exclude it from happening in certain rare occasions. One cannot say it is impossible for the threat of suicide to arise. That gives rise to the question at the other end of the spectrum as to the propriety or otherwise of total exclusion. Debate adjourned.;3252569

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Jim O'Keeffe;Fine Gael;Yesterday, I outlined some of the problems I had with the section we are now discussing. I now want to refer to a number of other aspects. I raise these issues because I passionately believe that our response to the issue of abortion should be to do something about the reality of abortion. That might sound odd, but it is not, because if we are considering any proposal on abortion – constitutional, legislative or otherwise – we have to determine whether it will do anything in the area of abortion and, in particular, crisis pregnancies. That is the first litmus test any proposal has to pass. Having gone through the all-party committee and studied its proposals, I genuinely do not believe the Minister's proposal will reduce the number of abortions by a single case. Does he believe it will have the desired effect of reducing the abortion rate? This is my major problem with the proposal. It is the reason I proposed at the all-party committee that we should focus on an action plan to deal with crisis pregnancies in a real attempt to reduce the num[1224] ber of abortions and at times bored my colleagues by later persisting with the view. The litmus test for the proposal is whether it will do anything about crisis pregnancies. The answer is 'no'. Constitutional or legislative proposals cannot impact on abortions carried out in Ireland because there are none. When I proposed an action plan to deal with crisis pregnancies, my concern was that by focusing on legislative and constitutional measures we would divert attention and energy from the real problem, which is what happened. During the many hours discussing the new, detailed definitions of abortion and other matters there has been virtually no debate on how we might deal with crisis pregnancies. At long last the Government has announced that a crisis pregnancy agency will be established. Since my original proposal to set up a crisis pregnancy agency 18 months ago, there have been 10,000 abortions, yet only now has the Government proposed to set up such an agency. This is a matter of concern. A proposal for such an agency is just the beginning. The real question is what will it do. Although we examined the kind of preventative measures which should be introduced to discourage crisis pregnancies at the all-party committee, the current debate has not focused on the matter. The all-party committee heard some interesting evidence. There were genuine and major differences of view on prevention. Some people focused on contraception and its availability, while others felt the main emphasis should be on discouraging early sexual intercourse among the young population. This, again, has not been discussed here. If we are concerned about reducing the rate of abortion, we should discuss these kinds of issues. They are the real issues in the real world as far as abortion is concerned because there are, I repeat, no abortions in Ireland. Our abortion rate is the 7,000 women and girls who travel to the UK every year. If we genuinely care about doing something about it, we should focus our attention on trying to introduce measures to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies in the first place, after which we should highlight the possibilities other than abortion available to those women who are in this vulnerable position. We should examine the newer forms of adoption and the financial and other supports which should be made available to pregnant women, none of which has been discussed. Having done this, we should discuss the position of the 100,000 Irish girls and women who have had abortions in the past 20 years. They have been ignored from two points of view – their need for medical check ups and their need for counselling services. Have arrangements been made to deal with these matters? These are the issues at the coalface as far as abortion is concerned. My plea to the Government and my colleagues is that we try to achieve consensus on the introduction of a strategy for dealing with crisis pregnancies as soon as poss[1225] ible. This is the only way we will impact on the rate of abortion. The alternative, a constitutional amendment and a constitutionally guaranteed Bill, will not impact on a single abortion. This raises several questions. Why has the Government chosen to adopt this approach? Why did it not address the issue of abortion long ago? Why was the crisis pregnancy agency not established when we first proposed it? Why was a proper strategy for the agency not among the real issues debated? This is the last day the Bill will be before the Dáil. I make a final plea, even at this late stage in the dying hours of this dying Administration, to focus on this issue, which is the real issue with respect to abortion. I very much regret there has been such nominal reference to it during the debate.;3253722

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;F;Mrs. Monica Barnes;Fine Gael;I will take the few minutes I am allowed due to the time constraints to acknowledge the travesty of this morning's proceedings and the guillotining of Committee Stage. I also take the opportunity to point out the repetition of mistakes we have made since 1983 and which we will continue to make. Mark my words, this legislation will come back to haunt us. As legislators we will be even less able to do anything about it because of the way we are being marginalised and sidelined. We will not be allowed to amend the legislation as the need arises due to Supreme Court interpretations or scientific progress which we cannot even begin to anticipate. We cannot separate one from the other. Arising from the Supreme Court's interpretation of the law in the tragic X case of 1992, the only objective of this legislation and the proposed constitutional amendment is to stop a suicide threat to the life of the mother during pregnancy being grounds for an abortion. The Bill raises huge problems with regard to cases in the future which follow the pattern in the C case. The C case was decided on the risk of suicide by a young girl who was in the care of a health board. The health board was an agency which was allowed to assist her to travel to terminate her pregnancy. If this proposal is passed and suicide is ruled out as a threat to the life of a pregnant woman, the basis for the C case decision is removed and a young woman in that position could not be assisted to travel abroad. This Bill provides that a person will have the right to travel abroad, but if that is challenged it will be found that an agency does not have the right. The consequences of that are very serious. The tragic circumstances in which such a challenge will be made will plunge this country back into the shaming and embarrassing marginalising of women that was the result of the 1983 referendum. It is appalling that in 2001 there are so few women Members of this House and the Seanad to speak on behalf of the women on which this legislation will directly impose. I am depressed that in 2001 the status, power and authority of women in their most intimate and fundamental right to be mothers and nurturers is once again being distrusted, legislated on and criminalised.;3253723

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;F;Mrs. Nora Owen;Fine Gael;I would have more admiration for the Minister if he said what is involved in the legislation. That is why Deputy Mitchell's amendment is so important. This is not just about the protection of human life but also about many other matters. It is flawed in that Article 40. 3.4 which the Minister proposes to insert does not restate the equal right to life of the mother which is stated in the preceding subsection. I do not care how much harmonious interpretation the Minister, whose words they are, believes there will be of these subsections being inserted in the Constitution. He has created a legal quagmire. Article 15. 2 gives the Oireachtas the sole right to pass legislation. The Minister is taking that away from us in the sense that we do not have a choice in the type of legislation we can pass in this instance. He should tell the people that, even if the amendment is passed, there is no obligation on the Oireachtas to pass the legislation. It is like quicksilver – now you see it, now you do not. The Minister should be honest with the people and say this may not give those who want this referendum what they want because the Oireachtas may not pass the legislation, in which event the amendment will fall. It is not I who say the Minister is not trying to do what is right but is trying to achieve consensus. That is what he said in his speech. He said we have considered ways not of doing the right thing but of moving forward in a way which can command the respect and support of the people. The less said about what the Progressive Democrats have done in this the better, especially given that they have abandoned women in this way despite having a woman leader and a woman Minister. They are not concerned about whether this is the right thing. They just say it reaches out to the consensus of the middle ground and has the capacity to garner the support of reasonably minded people. It is not a case of reaching out to ensure they do the right thing by pregnant women who might be suicidal or who do not want their pregnancies. If there is to be a harmonious interpretation of this part of the Constitution, what will a judge make of Article 40. 3.2 which states: 'The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done [such as a girl who is made pregnant through rape and is suicidal] vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen', when the next two sections state that this cannot be done in the case of a woman or girl being allowed to have an abortion if she is suicidal because the right has been removed in this instance? The Minister by his actions will be the author of a situation no one argued for or demanded. This is what happened in 1983. On his head be it if he puts this amendment to the people because he is not being honest with them as to its intent. It is a disgrace for a constitutional lawyer to sit beside the Minister and not argue with him as we do. He is small-minded and mean if he does not [1246] tell the Minister that this will be interpreted in a manner which is wrong.;3253724

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Willie O'Dea;Fianna Fáil;I listened carefully to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. I do not recall a Government spokesman claiming the legislation per se or the proposed amendment to the Constitution would deter anybody from seeking an abortion abroad. Side by side with the legislation there is a strategy being put in place. Deputy O'Keeffe is correct to state it should have been put in place by previous Governments. They should have dealt with the matter and we are all responsible and negligent to some extent in that the strategy has not been put in place until now. It is a useless exercise to look back in history. A strategy is being put in place. What we are discussing today is the Report Stage of legislation, which tries to make the law reflect what we think is the will of the people. That remains to be tested. Last night, Deputy O'Keeffe stated there was much confusion among the public and many people do not seem to understand what the Government is doing. He is perfectly correct. This is not unusual with constitutional referenda. Many people will focus on the issues once the date has been set for the referendum and the campaign is under way. However, I respectfully put it to Deputy O'Keeffe and others that if we want to go on extending the legislation and inserting matters like defining the moment at which life begins, etc., that will be a recipe which will spread confusion from one end of the country to the other. In so far as Deputy McManus's argument in relation to a possible conflict between Article 40. 3.3º and Article 40. 3.4º, I understand exactly where she is coming from, but her fears are groundless. As the Minister said, the two different Articles of the Constitution must be read together. It is a fundamental principle of interpretation of constitutional legislation that different Articles of the Constitution are presumed to be in harmony. If anybody wants to contend otherwise, the onus is on them to establish that there is genuine conflict and it is a very heavy onus to discharge. [1226] In any case, there is no conflict between the two Articles, Article 40. 3.3º and Article 40. 3.4º, as I understand them. If I am reading the position correctly, the protection provided for both mother and child in Article 40. 3.3º extends until the moment of implantation. From that moment on the appropriate protection is that provided in Article 40. 3.4º and the proposed legislation which it underpins. It is not a question of two different Articles of the Constitution being in conflict in relation to a particular situation. The two different Articles—;3253725

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Willie O'Dea;Fianna Fáil;The two different Articles of the Constitution apply to two different timeframes. Until the moment of implantation the law appropriate to both mother and child is that laid down in Article 40. 3.3º, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. From the moment of implantation onwards it is the law laid down in Article 40. 3.4º together with the legislation which it underpins. To answer the hypothetical question which Deputy McManus raised, if I can recall the details properly, as to what happens after implantation, the position we are trying to establish – if this referendum is passed by the people and the legislation goes on the Statute Book, this will be the position – is that from the moment of implantation on, suicide is not a valid reason to seek a termination of a pregnancy and anybody who seeks and procures termination of a pregnancy on the basis she says she is suicidal will be liable and in breach of the legislation. The person will, in effect, be committing abortion as proposed in the legislation. That is the position. I know it is a complex area. I do not want to over-simplify it in any way or do not want to be seen to seek to over-simplify it, but I decry the efforts of those who want to try to complicate it unnecessarily either because they have a different agenda. As I say, there is a fundamental principle of constitutional interpretation that different Articles of the Constitution are supposed to be read as if they are in harmony. If there are a number of possibly different interpretations, the interpretation which leads to one Article being in harmony with the other is the appropriate interpretation to take. Second, there is no conflict between Articles 40. 3.3º and 40. 3.4º because they apply to different situations.;3253730

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;The amendment we are discussing is amendment No. 1, which proposes to delete lines 14 to 20 on page four of the Bill. Those are the lines in the Bill which actually deal with the amendments which it is proposed to make to the [1227] Constitution which are set out in the First Schedule. The second and third parts of that proposed amendment are really the key ones as far as the activity of the House and the Oireachtas is concerned. The proposed second part of that amendment provides that if a law, containing only the provisions set out in this Bill, is enacted by the Oireachtas, this section, other than the amendment of Article 40 of the Constitution effected thereby, shall be omitted from every official text of the Constitution. The third part states that if such a law is not so enacted within 180 days of this section being added to the Constitution, this section shall cease to have effect. That is the provision for what I have called a Bill within a Bill which is designed to tell the Oireachtas that in the event that a referendum on this issue is carried, then the Oireachtas can do only one of two things: it can either pass the Bill, the text of which we have here, or it can refuse to pass it. If the amendment is carried, a Bill will come formally before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That Bill has, in its current draft, seven sections, and does a number of things to which I will come in a moment. The Oireachtas will be invited to consider it and decide to pass it as it stands or not to pass it. The Oireachtas will be told, 'You can pass this or reject it, but you cannot amend it,' on the basis that the people will have said, 'We are voting on the basis that this Bill will be passed into law.' That is a procedure which should not be entered into lightly. It is a procedure which we should avoid as far as possible. It is a procedure in which we do not need to engage in the context of the referendum about which we are talking. We spoke about this in committee when I asked what would happen if the Oireachtas, duly invited to pass this Bill, in its wisdom decided not to do so within 180 days. The Oireachtas would be saying, 'We do not agree with the people,' but it would be doing its job. It would be doing something which is plainly envisaged as a possibility in the text of the proposed constitutional amendment because, as I have said, the third part of the amendment reads: If such a law is not so enacted within 180 days of this section being added to this Constitution, this section shall cease to have effect . . . Therefore it is envisaged, at least as a possibility, that the Oireachtas might decide to take a different view from that expressed by the people in the referendum and might decide not to pass that Bill. I also speculated on Committee Stage on what the position might be if there is a referendum on this, if we ever get consensus on a date for it, if the Tánaiste comes to the conclusion that she agrees that there is enough consensus for the Government to specify a date about which there are many uncertainties, and it is followed in less than 180 days by a general election, which seems to be the likelihood. In that case, there will be a [1228] Dáil with a different composition and it might take a different view. Of course, on Committee Stage there was the following inevitable inane comment from a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, 'Is Deputy Dukes threatening to do away with this if we have a general election?' Leaving aside the political smart-alec comments, there is a definite possibility, a certainty, that the next Dáil will have a different complexion in some ways from this one. It might take a different view on this issue and I would not be at all surprised to find that in the next Dáil there will be people on the Fianna Fáil benches who would take a different view from the one they are being whipped to take today. I know that there are Members on the Fianna Fáil benches who hold a different view from the one that they are whipped to express on this issue and might find themselves in a position in the next Dáil where they might be free to state and act on it in this Chamber, but there are other possibilities. This Government, which hopes to put this through and envisages having a referendum, is one which is supported by four Independent Deputies. I gather some of the Independent Deputies are feeling rather tender about the way they think the Opposition feels about them. They should not worry too much because they are all regarded with a certain amount of warmth, but the fact of the matter is that they are all lining up solidly with the Government's position on this. We may have more single issue candidates in the next Dáil. There is at least a possibility that a future Government could rely on the support of a number of Independent Deputies who could adopt a very different view from the current four honest, diligent, unswerving Government supporters. If such Deputies were to take the opposite view it could be impossible, even for a Government including Fianna Fáil, to pass this legislation. We would then find ourselves, having undergone this upheaval, being required to pass or reject this legislation. This is something the Oireachtas would be entitled to do but, if it were to happen, many people with whom I disagree would have voted in a particular way on this referendum and would rightly feel badly let down. We should not run the risk of this happening as it would not enhance the public's view of the political process. I asked on Second and Committee Stages whether all of this was necessary and, although I waited for an answer, the Minister studiously avoided providing one. Does he consider this process to be the only way to deal with these complex issues? I do not, although there are those in the House who disagree with me. The Bill encompassed in the Bill to amend the Constitution includes a definition of abortion and provides for the granting of legal sanction to current medical practices in a particular area. It also contains an implicit legalisation of the morning after pill and IUDs and the overturning of the case law in the X-case, meaning the exclusion of suicidal intent as grounds for abortion. These are the issues the [1229] Oireachtas will be required to legislate for or reject in the event that this Bill is passed in its current form. Is this the only way of proceeding? Section 1(1) of the Bill within the Bill defines abortion. That is not necessary in the context of a Bill on which the Oireachtas is presented with a Hobson's choice – pass it or junk it but do not amend it. If we want to define abortion, the simplest way of doing so is to amend the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 in whatever way is considered necessary. The Government says that, for the purposes of dealing with the problem of abortion, we will define it as meaning the 'intentional destruction, by any means, of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman'. If we were to amend the 1861 Act to substitute that definition for the references in that Act to procuring a miscarriage, we could apply the penalties provided for to abortion. The intention of this measure is really to bring that up to date and square it with what we now consider a proper definition of abortion. In not one of the Government's responses to this issue has there been any systematic examination of why it would be wrong to achieve its objectives by amending the 1861 Act. I have not seen any analysis of what that would mean nor have I seen any conclusive demonstration that it would be in any way wrong, undesirable or difficult to proceed in that way. If we want to give the word 'abortion' the meaning that is set out here, it would be simpler to return to the 1861 Act and write in the appropriate definition, instead of going through this rigmarole of constitutional and legislative action. The Government has not even considered that as an operational way of resolving this problem. I have my views as to why it has not and they do not reflect well on the Government. The legalisation of the morning after pill and IUDs by this means is a by-product of that definition of abortion and the Government's grass has been cut on the morning after pill already because decisions have been made elsewhere that simply say that the types of morning after pill permitted are not abortifacients so we need not worry or consider them to be illegal. I assume the same logic applies to the IUD. I am not alone in the House in adopting this view. Many of us did not have to wait for expert medical opinion to give us that read on the morning after pill and IUDs. This legalisation, which the Government has made part of its case on this issue, is a by-product of the definition of abortion. To the extent that it was needed it would be secured, whichever way we went about making this definition of abortion operational, and it would follow for making the appropriate amendments to the 1861 Act. Those two objectives of this Bill within a Bill could be achieved by a simple, straightforward and easily comprehensible amendment of the 1861 Act without undergoing the constitutional and legislative mumbo-jumbo with which the Government has saddled us. [1230] The third measure contained in section 1(2) of this Bill within a Bill proposes to give legal backing to current medical practices which have been described and debated at length by people who are far more competent than me. The Government is telling us that in order to reassure people that particular procedures, interventions or treatments, currently available and accepted as ethical, will continue to be legally available and accepted as ethical, we must insert this subsection into the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill. What does the Minister think this really means? We would not simply be giving legal backing and legal authority to the procedures and practices which exist today, we would be giving legal backing, sanction and foundation to whatever those practices might be at any given time during the legislation's existence. Will the Minister or the Members of the Oireachtas decide what those practices may be? The answer is 'no'. We would hand over the decision as to what is legal, ethical and permitted to another group of people, namely the doctors. No definition of procedures is provided. The reference is to the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner. What we are saying, therefore, is that we will legalise whatever medical practitioners consider ethical and proper. I do not wish to disparage anyone or accuse them of bad faith, but this means that the Oireachtas is handing over its power to decide what is ethical in this area to people outside. That is of concern to many people. We are not only saying that whatever is legal today will continue to be legal, but that whatever they decide at any moment should be legal and ethical is so and we will back them without question and without any power to influence or require consultation on the matter. That is an odd way to legislate. It might be more honest to have a subsection in the Bill that provides that whatever the IMO says, at any time, goes. That is not a criticism of the IMO but it can change its views. It did so earlier this year and that is fact. We are handing over the power to decide what is proper, ethical and legal to a group of people who are entitled to, and do, change their views from time to time. We are saying that whatever they decide is fine by us and we will give them legal backing for it. That is what this Bill does. There is no point in the Minister of State shaking his head at me. He knows that I speak the truth. This does not give the Oireachtas any power to inspect what is being regarded as ethical or to modify it in any way. Acting Chairman: I ask again that the Deputy speak through the Chair.;3253733

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;F;Ms. Frances Fitzgerald;Fine Gael;I wish to raise another aspect of this with the Minister and I mentioned this on Committee Stage. The Taoiseach said this morning that the choice is between this referendum or abortion on demand. That is ridiculous. No one is talking about abortion on demand. We are talking about detailed legislation and trying to deal with a difficult situation where everyone wants to see a reduction in the numbers of women having abortions. The legislation does not deal with those women. It says they are repugnant to the Constitution. That is the message the Government is giving the 7,000 women who travelled to England this year for an abortion. They are criminalised in the legislation. A number of Members queried the 12 year jail sentence and the Minister answered that on Committee Stage by saying it was already in the old [1247] legislation. That is not the point. He is bringing in what he calls new, modern and appropriate legislation to deal with a social issue and yet women are being criminalised with 12 years as the sentence. That is no way to deal with an issue such as this. The Constitution is no place to deal with it either. Almost no country in the world deals with this issue in a constitution. That is not the place to deal with it because it is much too complex. We do not have any idea what type of case law this will give rise to. A number of Members said there is a contradiction between Article 40. 3.3 and Article 40. 3.4, that they are different and will be interpreted as such. The Minister said that, when read together, they will be seen as harmonious. In fact, there is a significant difference in the definitions of unborn and in the protection of women in both subsections. They are contradictory and I have no doubt that, when they go before the Supreme Court, that will be seen. I wish to raise another issue relating to mental health. Why will we be the only country in the European Union where women's mental health will not be protected? I quoted the statistics and information from the Green Paper on this. Every other country takes account of women's mental health in its legislation and we are doing the exact opposite. Why should we do that? What is reasonable or middle ground about excluding women's mental health as a consideration? How can any right-minded person say mental health can be excluded and say it is reasonable and middle ground and that the whole person or the whole situation or psychological trauma a woman may face is being taken into account? What about the different countries? Does Austria protect the mental health of women in pregnancy where there is felt to be a risk to her life? The answer is yes. Does Belgium? The answer is yes. Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Northern Ireland and Sweden also preserve women's mental health. What is so different about Irish women? The United Kingdom does so in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. What is so different about the mental health of Irish women from that of their EU counterparts that it should be dealt with in this extraordinary, super-constitutional way? Why is this differentiation being included? What is reasonable and middle ground about excluding mental health? I asked on Committee Stage what a reasonable mother or father would want for their 14 year old child if she were pregnant as a result of rape or incest and were suicidal. Does the Minister think they would want to consider a variety of options for her without being criminalised by the Constitution? I believe they would. In the C case there was a nexus between the determination on mental health and the right to travel. That is gone.;3253734

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;F;Ms. Frances Fitzgerald;Fine Gael;I agree with colleagues who said it is disgraceful the manner in which the Government is handling this. The Taoiseach's fine words this morning are contradicted by the way the Government has handled this legislation, by guillotining it on Committee Stage and in the House today. I understand why the Government does this, because this is legislation of which it should be ashamed because it is anti-woman, insensitive, hypocritical and politically driven. There is no doubt it reduces protection for women in Ireland. I wish we had time to debate it in more detail so that the message could get out more clearly, and I hope it does in coming weeks. I also hope women and their partners, husbands or boyfriends will see the legislation for what it is. It is anti-woman and distinguishes between mental and physical health. It reduces the protection women have in Ireland, especially if they are suicidal. The Government is using a most extraordinary mechanism which has never been used before to do this. The Minister said things on Committee Stage which amounted to an admittance that he did not have the courage to bring legislation to the House and open it up to proper discussion and give it the necessary time for that.;3253736

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;Yes, I mean the Medical Council. There is nothing here that gives the Oireachtas any power to come back and question what the Medical Council says or to recommend that it does anything different. At any point in time this says, in effect, that what the Medical Council says goes. I am not criticising the Medical Council, but the Legislature should not do that. Two of the Bill's proposals, as mentioned, can be dealt with by simple, straightforward and comprehensible amendments of the 1861 Act. The third requires more thought than the Government has given it here. It would be preferable to have a provision that gave the Oireachtas some role in deciding what these practices should be. If we go to the trouble of having a constitutional amendment on the issue and of writing into the amendment the requirement that the Oireachtas pass a law about it, then it is important enough for the Oireachtas to want to stay part of the decision process and any future changes. It would be much more desirable to make a provision that would give the Oireachtas some ongoing association with decisions. I do not know what that association might be but it is certainly not this provision, dragged in by a constitutional amendment with an invitation to the Oireachtas to agree or disagree with the people. That is not the way to deal with it. The fourth proposal in this complex paper is the deletion of the existence of suicidal intent as a ground for an abortion. That is the effect of those few words in lines 15 and 16 on page 8 of the Bill. It speaks of procedures that, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, are necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life 'other than by self-destruction'. Those four words are the key to this and they are why we are here. What the Government wants to do is to satisfy the judgment given by the courts in the X case. We are having a referendum that deals with all these issues, the Bill within a Bill, the definition of abortion, the morning after pill, IUDs and legislation for the protection of current medical practices. It is not because we want to do only those things or because we want to do them in an efficient, clear and transparent way, but because the Government wants to row back the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case. We should not do that but the Government clearly takes a different view. It would have been more desirable and much clearer if the Government said plainly that it wanted to row back the X case and it needed a constitutional amendment to do it. I agree that a [1232] constitutional amendment is needed to do it. The debate would have been clearer and there would have been less argument and hassle if the Government had decided to do it. However, the Government has decided to have this Bill within a Bill and I know why. The Government wanted to have a referendum on rowing back the X case. It is pandering to people who take the same view and who have said consistently since 1981 that they do not trust legislators. They know it would not be enough to have that little piece in the Constitution that says we row back the X case because they do not trust what the Government might do afterwards. They need to follow up on it so the Government, supinely and cravenly, agreed that it is not trustworthy and decided to put what it will do into the constitutional amendment also to prevent a change of mind afterwards. If it changes its mind, it will be seen to go against the expressed will of the people. A Government that takes that view and brings before the Oireachtas legislation designed to bind its hands, just because it accepts the proposition of people who do not trust politicians, deserves to be thrown out of office immediately. It is a Government that is giving in and pandering to an opinion that is not justified. I will not make a liar of myself and say that I have absolute trust in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and I will not insult anybody by picking them out. I am never sure it will do what it says it will do, but I am prepared to debate with it in the House and I do not require it to bind itself with oaths, promises or constitutional amendments of this kind. Those who say they do not trust the politicians to get it right are the people who consistently, spectacularly, and with every confidence, have got it wrong since 1981. They are the people who told us in 1981 and 1982 that a simple form of words as an amendment to the Constitution would rid us of this problem for ever. They produced a situation where what was clear before, because we had only the 1861 Act, became unclear. Without that wording in the Constitution, which they said would put this problem beyond our ken forever, we could not have had the court judgment in the X case. Now they realise that they got it wrong and come again with the same certainty that they have it right and that we cannot be trusted. In fact, although I pay no unnecessary or excessive compliments to the present Government, this House has a better record of getting things right and a better mechanism for mending things that go wrong than those who urge us to bind ourselves with this measure. The Oireachtas has the power to amend legislation. It can examine its effects and, if it is not having the desired effect, it can amend it. However, the Government proposes to deprive the Oireachtas of the ability to re-examine this matter if, in the future, we find it does not have the intended effect since any change can only happen through referendum. The Government seeks to tie the hands of the Oireachtas and prevent it from doing something [1233] that parliaments have an obligation to do, and that, by and large, they show themselves capable of doing. One can easily think of cases where legislation passed by this House has had a different effect from that wanted and so has been amended. The Minister knows what I am talking about. He even proposes amendments at this Stage, which illustrates that he is still thinking and modifying his approach to this measure and the Bill's provisions to match more closely his intentions. As that is so, why does he seek to bind our hands and prevent the Oireachtas from having a power that a Parliament should always have and seek to retain? There are issues that must be referred to the people under the Constitution and it is right that they should be, but the Oireachtas should not surrender its constitutional power, prerogatives and duties to anyone else. The guillotine will come down today and I have a terrible image of Deputy O'Dea sitting with his knitting needles at its foot watching the blade come down, chop chop, at each Stage of this debate. However I will not go into that as the mind boggles. It would be horror writ large.;3253753

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Alan Dukes;Fine Gael;Before the guillotine falls, the Minister should tell us why he believes we cannot enact three of the four measures contained here by legislation properly passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas elected by the people under the Constitution to do so, and to leave the one constitutional issue to be put separately to the people. Why does the Minister set his face against the ordinary legislative procedure and instead complicate measures with this Bill within a Bill? It is unnecessary and the Minister has not given one reason for doing it. Because it is so complicated, the Minister will get a verdict from the people – if he can agree a date with the Tánaiste to hold the referendum – which says that this is as clear as a bush and they will not have it. That will be a good day's work by them.;3253759

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Joe Higgins;Socialist Party;(Dublin West): I deplore strongly the time constraints placed on the discussion of the Bill. I regret that I was not involved in the Committee Stage, but others did well in pointing out the many flaws in the Bill, its repugnant nature and its inconsistencies. The guillotine today will not allow discussion to be brought to a proper conclusion. The Government ought to consider amending or withdrawing the Bill. It should have learned lessons from the history of sensitive issues dealt with by the crude mechanism of a constitutional amendment. I support Deputy Gay Mitchell's amendment which seeks the deletion of lines 14 to 20 on page four, which refers to the contents of page seven, Cuid a hAon as Gaeilge, and Part Two in English. There is a clear conflict between Article 40. 3.3º [1234] and the proposed Article 40. 3.4º in this provision. This conflict may return to haunt the Government and it should think again if it believes this is the end of litigation on this matter. Deputy O'Dea accuses some of us of complicating the issue for our own agendas, but, unfortunately for him, it is reality and the experience of life that complicate the issue. Cases which arose and convulsed this State were unforeseen before 1983. Those who argued that difficult situations could arise were rubbished then and accused of complicating the issue but life vindicated them. The Government's constitutional amendment, particularly Article 40. 3.4º, gives an embryo a greater right than the woman carrying it. Inevitably, its conflict with Article 40. 3.3º will have consequences. It is clear that this legislation, to rule out the danger of suicide as grounds for legal termination, is in direct contravention of what is already in the Constitution. Down the line the Government will be seen not to have done what it set out to do with this legislation. It is reprehensible that it brings forward this legislation simply to close an opening made by a judgment of the Supreme Court and does so for nakedly political reasons. That is the fundamental reason that this Bill is being brought before us now. There is a huge dishonesty in the Bill it is built on dishonesty. It is built on the attempt to pervert language as an expression of reality, an honest expression of what exists in life. Therefore in the Bill the abortion of a foetus made necessary by the illness of a pregnant woman and in order to save her life does not become an abortion at all. It is a fundamentally dishonest proposal which allows the Government to bring forward and implement some guarantees it gave to certain minority sections of society in its own political interests. Hammering into the Constitution the type of legislation provided for here and in Part 2 is a crude mechanism. It is an extremely inflexible way to deal with issues that will continue to develop as society and the attitudes and ideas of people develop. Having something frozen in the Constitution is not the way to deal with issues that are developing on an ongoing basis. There is no doubt that the attitude of the people with regard to the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy has shifted massively in the course of recent decades and will shift further in the future as the experience of life is taken more into account by them. Here the Government wants to insert something into the Constitution in order to pickle and copperfasten it rather than dealing with these matters through legislation which can be reformed and amended and brought up to date in line with experience and the views of the people. The Government strategy is a political one which, unfortunately, will come apart. It is taking what it believes to be the so-called middle ground and the strategy is to appeal to it and the minorities opposed to a woman's right to choose and in [1235] this way gain some crude political advantage in the run-up to the general election. The Government hopes in this way to copperfasten for itself a few percentage points that might make the difference between being in or out of government after the election. It has nothing to do with the interests of women, justice for women or women's rights or any moral question it is crude political expediency which is designed to make the pro-choice section of society seem extreme. This is a favourite Government tactic to attempt to cast as extremists those who stand for the right of women to choose to terminate a pregnancy. It is not an extreme position to respect the right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy it is the experience of thousands of Irish women who do so every year. It is insulting to deal with the issue in this manner by, in effect, continuing to marginalise the women concerned in the way that this legislation and the Government strategy do. I will finish by drawing attention to the extreme political difficulties that the Government is going to face on this matter in the months ahead. I predict that its political strategy will come apart at the seams. For example, what will the Catholic Church state in regard to this legislation? There are a number of issues in the Bill which are fundamentally repugnant to Catholic teaching. The post-coital pill and the intra-uterine device are utterly repugnant to Catholic teaching. Will the Catholic Church, as it has a right to do for its own believers, state publicly that no Catholic should support this legislation because it is enshrining contraceptive practices that it fundamentally opposes? Where will that leave the Government with its consensus and attempt to keep the middle ground? Will the Catholic Church be dishonest and keep quiet on the matter on the basis that this is an enshrinement of its position and a step towards further restrictions on women's rights in these matters? The Catholic Church will be dishonest if it stays quiet on this issue. The logic of the debate may well be that the Government will face the same problem that it faced with the Nice treaty. It could come a cropper through a similar alignment of voting by disparate groups: those who are fundamentally in favour of a woman's right to choose and those who are morally opposed to any concession to either a morning after pill or any form of termination whatsoever. What will the Government do if the main Church on the island opposes the Bill? Will it then press on with the referendum? It is shameful legislation which criminalises women by tagging a penalty of 12 years in prison onto any woman who would attempt to self-administer a termination of pregnancy. It flies in the face of all the words of alleged compassion coming from the Minister for Health and Children and the Taoiseach who when he launched the Bill spoke about the thousands of sad stories of women travelling abroad to avail of terminations. He said they must be listened to and [1236] appreciated. Instead the Government proposes 12 years imprisonment for those who would choose, perhaps out of desperation, to self-administer a termination in the State. That is quite incredibly uncaring and lacking in compassion. It is a marginalisation of the tens of thousands of women who have availed of termination of pregnancy. It keeps them on the margins and ignores their stories and does so for political expediency. The State should not interfere in this matter other than to see that people's health is protected and proper procedures are in place in cases where women decide they have to choose to terminate a pregnancy. That is the reality the State will have to face. It would have had to face it long ago if it were not for the convenient back door of pagan England being there. If Irish women were dying in the back streets as a result of back street abortions, which would have been forced on them if Britain were not there, the law in this country would have been changed long ago because there would be a clamour to change it. Even people with a moral difficulty who would never choose abortion for themselves would have to recognise that right should exist for the people caught up in those circumstances. It is a bad day's work and I oppose the passing of this Bill.;3253760

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;I will try to avoid repeating things already covered by other speakers. It is regrettable this debate is taking place today. The Government has taken an extraordinary measure. It has ordered a constitutional referendum Bill and then tried to constrain and design the debate within the Houses of the Oireachtas in a manner that is practically guaranteed to ensure minimum public knowledge of what happens here and as little reportage as possible. We had a Committee Stage that had practically no coverage in the national press, other than, I think, The Irish Times, which gave it some small coverage. There were no particular references to it on national news bulletins. We have a guillotine debate today, budget day, when, as the Government is well aware, the only reportage from this House in any of tomorrow's papers or any of the news bulletins from 5 o'clock onwards will be the budget debate. This is an extraordinary way to try to ensure information is available to the general public to understand the issues involved, should this matter be put to the people. It is an even more extraordinary way to try and secure what was described as political consensus on all sides of the House. In my time in this House, I have not seen any referendum issue dealt with in this way and it is an extraordinary way to approach this. Deputy Dukes was right when he said there is no need for a constitutional referendum to enact the Bill other than the fact that the Bill envisaged excludes the X case principles. It seeks to ensure that, should a pregnant woman or teenage girl be suicidal, she cannot effect a termination of her pregnancy in this State. That is the sole issue of substance that requires a referendum. This is an [1237] action replay of the 1992 referendum, dressed up in different clothing. I would have more respect for the Government if it honestly reproduced the 1992 proposal and said it disagreed with the outcome of that referendum. It should have said it had a moral view that this is the way the law should be changed and it was willing to debate that in public.;3253761

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Alan Shatter;Fine Gael;—in the presence of four Independent Deputies who have not the courage to participate in any aspect of this debate here. The four Independents were not seen on Committee or Report Stages. They are back in hiding. Is it a voluntarily imposed hiding or is it another example of the Government Whip kidnapping Independent Deputies and ensuring they are kept out of the House so they do not suffer public foot in mouth disease that could result in removing any credibility, which might be left with this measure, by, for example, the type of exposé in which Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae might engage? We should not be doing this exercise. We should approach this issue with considerably more honesty. On Committee Stage, I raised an issue on which I received no coherent or straightforward reply from the Minister. We are dressing up this debate and discussing whether it is acceptable that a pregnancy may or may not be terminated in circumstances where the pregnant woman or teenage girl is suicidal. In most instances where there is a possibility someone may be suicidal as a result of a pregnancy, it is where pregnancy is a consequence of rape or incest. We should not talk of that issue in the context of suicide. It is time to recognise in a mature way if a woman or young girl is the victim or rape or incest and becomes pregnant, it is an additional cruelty to deny the victim the right to decide if she wants to maintain that pregnancy. We are saying we will force her to maintain it in this country but if she wants to get on a plane and go abroad, she may be allowed to terminate the pregnancy. I raised the challenge to the Minister, if his wife or daughter were the victim of rape and pregnant, would he like to have available to her the facility to terminate that pregnancy. This is a straightforward question. How many Government Deputies, who support this Bill and who found their wife, daughter, niece or neighbour's child was pregnant as a consequence of rape, would say she should not have her pregnancy terminated here? Fortuitously, England is only next door so she could get on a plane if she wishes, but in Ireland we will not allow this whether she is suicidal or not. In a [1238] more mature society we would recognise there are circumstances in which we should more honestly discuss this issue. This Bill is purely about reversing the consequences of the X case and the way in which this debate has been ordered is designed to delimit the contributions the Members of this House can make. I am conscious there are other Members who want to speak and I do not intend to raise all the issues I raised either on Second or Committee Stages. However, I draw the Minister's attention to yet another anomaly in this legislation, which has been worked upon by the Government for four and a half years and over which the Minister wants to stand. He now recognises it needs amendment and there are four ministerial amendments tabled for today. It has another peculiarity to which nobody has yet referred. The Bill the Dáil will chose to enact or reject, following a referendum, if the referendum is passed, contains section 6. This section says: 'Sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, are hereby repealed'. If the Bill is enacted, the effect of that provision is to immediately repeal those sections. What does that mean? It means if someone is being prosecuted for an unlawful termination by usage of the provisions under the Offences against the Person Act, at the time when this Bill is enacted, that prosecution has to cease and anyone who has carried out an unlawful abortion in this State, prior to the enactment of this Bill, is given by this Minister a legislative and constitutional amnesty. This is something to which no one has yet referred. We have had the tax amnesty, now we will have an amnesty granted to those people with whom the Minister says he wants to deal, people who may carry out unlawful abortions. On a number of occasions as justice spokesperson for Fine Gael and in other capacities, I have seen many criminal law Bills discussed in this House. If a new criminal offence is replacing an old one, a criminal law Bill will usually contain a section, which is a preservation provision. This preserves in being the law as it was at the time when the Bill was enacted in respect of outstanding offences, for which prosecutions have been initiated. Section 6 does not do that. If the referendum succeeds and the Bill is enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas and a person is charged with the offence of carrying out an unlawful termination under the Offences Against the Person Act, the signing of the Bill by the President will grant an amnesty to those people. The criminal offence of which they have been charged will be struck out.;3253765

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;F;Ms. Liz McManus;Democratic Left;I wonder if I can have the Minister of State's permission to address the House on an issue which does not relate to those of the male gender, but has direct relevance to females whose lives are threatened by this Government's proposal. I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Gay Mitchell on those grounds. Far from legislating for the protection of human life in pregnancy, the central purpose of this Bill is to ensure there is a withdrawal of the protection of life of suicidal women during pregnancy. The Taoiseach gave a misleading impression to the House when he quoted Dr. Ken Whitaker, chairman of the expert review committee on the Constitution. Dr. Whitaker in his role as chairman of that committee and in his personal testimony indicated very clearly that he did not support the constitutional referendum as a way of dealing with this very difficult and complex issue. He put forward a set of proposals for legislation that would deal with the difficult issues and provide for the cases of suicidal women. He felt absolutely confident that this could be done. He said that if a referendum is decided, the wording will need the most careful consideration. There should be as few adjectives and adverbs as possible because their meaning is arguable. 'Induced', 'indirect', and 'intentional' are examples. I have looked at the very complex Bill that has been put forward by the Government and have found, at random, other adjectives that could cause similar problems, for example, 'in particular', 'intended', 'appropriate', 'medical' and 'reasonable', as in 'reasonable opinion'. The advice of Dr. Whitaker has been totally ignored by the Government. The Taoiseach was also misleading in his statement this morning when he seemed to think, [1244] wrongly, that allowing mental illness or mental conditions to be considered where there was a risk to the life of the mother would automatically open the floodgates to easy availability of abortions. There are two examples very close to home which he needs to consider in that regard. Here in the Republic of Ireland the right of a suicidal woman whose life is at risk, to have an abortion, has been enshrined in the Constitution since 1992 and there has been no opening of the floodgates. The other example is that of Northern Ireland where abortions are carried out in those circumstances and where no floodgates have opened either.;3253766

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Micheál Martin;Fianna Fáil;I want to refute a point made by Deputies Dukes, Jim O'Keeffe, O'Dea, Joe Higgins and Shatter and a number of speakers yesterday. We have had a Second Stage debate this morning. There has not been any attempt to discuss each amendment separately, which is fair enough. I have heard all the points, with the exception of one or two, on Second and Committee Stages. The points made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe about the crisis pregnancy agency are valid. We did not say at the outset that the legislation would deal with the issue of crisis pregnancies or abortion. The establishment of a crisis pregnancy agency is the mechanism to do that. We have taken on board the recommendations of the all-party committee on that issue. We have provided £5 million for 2002 for expenditure to assist women in crisis pregnancies, to provide education and other programmes to seek to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and to assist women who may have had abortions in England in terms of post-abortion counselling. We are dealing with that in a comprehensive [1240] manner. Those issues were raised by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. Deputy Dukes made a number of points. I have difficulty with some of them, including the point that the Oireachtas should have a role in deciding when the life of the mother should be saved via medical procedures. He wants the Oireachtas to have a role in terms of what medical procedures may be entered into by medical practitioners to save the life of a mother in the event of a real and substantial risk to her life. I disagree with the idea that such a significant body of people could have that type of specific role. That is wrong and entirely inappropriate. We cannot have the Oireachtas second guessing the type of actions and interventions medical doctors must make in such situations on a daily or weekly basis. It is an untenable point. We are not handing it over to the Medical Council.;3253777

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Gay Mitchell;Fine Gael;Tairgim leasú a 2: I leathanach 5, líne 26, 'agus Forálacha Eile' a chur isteach i ndiaidh 'Dhaonna'. I move amendment No. 2: In page 4, line 24, after 'Life' to insert 'and Other Provisions'. I moved on to this amendment deliberately to allow other Deputies to speak because I want the [1241] record to show that Deputies, who have spoken on Report Stage, cannot get back in. I understand Deputies McManus, Barnes, Owen, Fitzgerald and Timmins may wish to speak, so I will be brief to give everyone an opportunity because the debate will be guillotined in 25 minutes. The amendment seeks to rename the Bill by inserting 'and Other Provisions'. The reason I tabled it is to draw the public's attention to the fact that it is not only about the protection of human life in pregnancy, but about reintroducing the criminal offence of abortion. It would not be as specified in the 1861 Act, namely, to assist in procuring a miscarriage, but would be the destruction of unborn human life after implantation. There are also a number of other provisions. I do not intend to spend a long time discussing this point because I did so on Committee Stage. The Minister will have the power to designate approved places where these terminations, which are not called abortions, can take place. There is the definition of what is a medical practitioner, which the Minister had to define and redefine between Committee and Report Stages. There is also a reasonable opinion being formed in good faith by a doctor and a definition of a woman. One provision about which I am dissatisfied, although the Minister introduced amendments to meet my concerns, is that the Minister will have power by order in the future to vary the effect of a constitutional amendment. I have serious misgivings about that and I have included safeguards in the amendments I tabled. Since the Minister is anxious to respond to the debate, I ask him to address one of my amendments. In the definition section, the other provisions to which I referred, there is no definition as to when life begins. I tabled an amendment to ask the Minister to deal with that. The unborn should be defined as human life which begins at conception. Perhaps when the Minister responds he could tell us if he is prepared to accept that amendment and include it in the definition section. Many people outside the House will be interested to hear that, since this will be read with Article 40. 3.3º, the unborn is not defined. Since the Minister is including implantation, perhaps it would not be any harm if a definition of the unborn was included in the definition section. If the Minister is not prepared to do that, will he tell the House why? If the Minister does not answer that question, it will show on the record and the people will make their own deductions. It is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it. I will not delay the House because other Deputies want to speak. I want a specific reference to that in the Minister's reply. It will be important to many people if and when they consider the Bill in a referendum.;3253788

Twenty-fifth Amendmen;05.12.01;M;Mr. Willie O'Dea;Fianna Fáil;As we are concerned about the record of the House, I want to put something clearly on it. During the debate on the previous amendment Deputy Shatter referred to section 6 [1242] and said we were, in effect, giving a legal and constitutional amnesty to anybody who committed an abortion and was being prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, as and from the moment this Bill is signed into law. Section 21(1)(d) of the Interpretation Act, 1937, which is still law, provides that where an Act of the Oireachtas repeals the whole or a portion of a previous statute, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal shall not: (d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of an offence against or contravention of the statute or portion of a statute so repealed which was committed before such repeal, or Section 21(1)(e) states that where an Act of the Oireachtas repeals the whole or a portion of a previous statute, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal shall not: prejudice or affect any legal proceedings, civil or criminal, pending at the time of such repeal in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, offence, or contravention as aforesaid.

I move: ""That the Bill be now read a Second Time."" Today, we mark the introduction of a Bill which, if passed, will give the people of Ireland the chance to vote on one of the most debated sections in our Constitution, Article 40.3.3°. I am conscious that we are sitting on a Friday, which is not usual. I thank colleagues for being here when they might have imagined themselves being elsewhere. I ask, as we sit here in these comfortable brown leather chairs in a somewhat abstract environment, for the somewhere else we imagine to be the ports and airports of this country, whether in Cork, Waterford, Dublin, Shannon or elsewhere, where a woman one could know is waiting to go to another country. She might be sitting quietly next to the hen party, the businessman or businesswoman, or the honeymooners, seeming to be on a similar journey, but she is not. Even if she might have a girlfriend or a partner with her, her journey is a lonely one. No matter what her circumstances, she cannot access the care she needs in her own country. She may have been raped. She may have words of congratulations and questions about when she is due ringing in her ears even as she knows she is carrying a baby with a fatal condition but feels she cannot say. Do we imagine that whatever her circumstances that this is a journey or a decision she is undertaking lightly? This is a reality today for at least nine women in this country as we sit here in the comfort of Dáil Éireann. I introduce this Bill mindful of the impact of the eighth amendment over the 35 years since its insertion. In particular, I am mindful of the women whose most painful, most personal stories we know because it forced them to go to court or to other countries. We are here because of the courage of women like Amanda Mellet and Siobhán Whelan-----";NULL

2304;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Simon Harris;Fine Gael;"We are here because of the courage of women like Amanda Mellet, Siobhán Whelan and so many others who publicly relived the worst moments of their lives to make us to think about why change is needed in this country. We are here knowing the tragedy which befell Savita Halappanavar and her family. We remember you, Savita. We remember Miss X. We remember Miss A, B, C and D. We remember Miss Y. We remember Miss P. We think, and we must think, of all the thousands of women from every county in Ireland who have made those lonely journeys to other countries at times of crisis in their lives because we have let them down. We think of the women who now face these crises alone and unsafe, with pills purchased online rather than with the safe medical care they need. I have heard from doctors that women are being harmed or are at risk as I speak by taking unregulated abortion pills. I cannot live with that and I cannot ignore that. If this Oireachtas facilitates a referendum, I will be casting my ballot for repeal and asking others to do the same because I cannot live any longer with a law that sees a woman or girl who has been brutally raped forced to continue her pregnancy or travel to another country if she cannot. I cannot live any longer with a law that forces families devastated by a fatal foetal diagnoses to travel to another country and bring home the remains of their much-loved and much-wanted but lost child in the boot of a car or by courier service. I cannot live any longer in denial of the realities of women travelling every day from every county in the country or buying those pills on the Internet. The Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is not just about giving the people of Ireland a say on how they believe we should now proceed. It is about giving the people of Ireland a say on how we treat women. It is about how our country treats our sisters, our wives, mothers, daughters, friends and colleagues at a time when they most need our care. I do not believe Irish people want their country to be a place that is cold, uncaring and neglectful towards women in crisis but, unfortunately, that has been the sad and painful legacy of the eighth amendment. If we want to change things, we have to make the fundamental and important change of removing it from our Constitution. A great proportion of the people who will vote on this proposal, once the Oireachtas passes the Bill before us today, have lived with Article 40.3.3° for their entire reproductive lives. Many medical practitioners have had to practise under the shadow of Article 40.3.3° for their whole careers. I think it is time - in fact, long past time - that we give all of these people, indeed all our people, the opportunity to make their voices heard. There will be those who have never had a say. There will be those who have changed their minds and would like to have another say. There will be those who wish to strongly reaffirm their deeply held views. All of these people deserve a chance to have their voices heard and respected. I believe the holding of this referendum is nothing less than a democratic imperative. In my view, we have a duty as legislators to give the people of Ireland their voice and their vote. It was 1983 when Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution was inserted by the eighth amendment, with the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments inserted in 1992, expanding the text. In 1992, the Supreme Court decided in Attorney General v. X that the Constitution permitted a termination of a pregnancy where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of a woman which could only be removed by terminating the pregnancy. Yet, it was another 21 years before lawful termination of pregnancy was placed on the Statute Book by means of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013. However, so many of the difficult and painful realities facing Irish women could not be addressed by that Act due to the constitutional block that is the eighth amendment. Our law as it stands permits terminations only in situations where a woman will otherwise die. It does not permit termination, for example, in the heartbreaking cases where there is a diagnosis of a foetal condition likely lead to death before or shortly after birth. It does not allow termination where a woman has been raped. It does not permit termination where a woman's health may be permanently damaged by her pregnancy. It has become clear that the Oireachtas can do nothing to help these women without constitutional change. When this Government took office, we put a process in place to work through that needed constitutional change. The Citizens' Assembly report and the report of the all-party Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution provide the thorough and considered basis on which the Government now proceeds. I reiterate my thanks to those who participated for the substantial contribution they have made. As a result of their work and the further details considered by Government, we propose, by means of the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, to delete Article 40.3.3° in its entirety and to substitute an article in the Constitution the object and effect of which would be to articulate clearly the principle that laws may be enacted to provide for the regulation of termination of pregnancy. I wish to reassure Members of the Oireachtas and the public that this clause would not oust the jurisdiction of or restrict the right of access to the courts. Any legislation that may be enacted post referendum would, like all legislation, remain subject to review by the courts. It would also be subject to the normal legislative process and detailed scrutiny in the Houses of the Oireachtas in a similar manner to any other legislation. If the amendment is approved by the referendum of the people, it would have the effect of deleting the eighth, thirteenth and fourteenth amendments of the Constitution, which would mean that the substantive law on the termination of pregnancy, which is currently provided in the Constitution and in statute law, would henceforth be provided by way of statute law. The Bill consists of two sections and a Schedule. Section 1 provides that Article 40 of the Constitution will be amended by the substitution for subsection 3° of section 3, the text of which is set out in Parts 1 and 2 of the Schedule in Irish and English, respectively. Section 2 is the citation provisions and states that the constitutional amendment ""shall be called the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution"". It also provides for the Act to be cited as the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2018. The Schedule consists of two parts. Part 1 sets out the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment in Irish and Part 2 sets it out in English. The English text reads: ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy."" I wish to return to the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. A majority of members of that all-party committee accepted the five ancillary recommendations set out by the Citizens’ Assembly in its final report. The committee also made recommendations of its own, which focus on decriminalising women, free access to contraception, comprehensive sex education and obstetric care and counselling. Those recommendations are extremely important to me as Minister for Health and to my commitment to ensuring that all women accessing maternity services should receive the same standard of safe, high-quality care. We have published Ireland’s first ever national maternity strategy. The Health Service Executive, HSE, has developed national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death and bereavement teams are being established in each maternity unit. The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, now has national standards for safer, better maternity services. Every woman from every corner of Ireland should expect and be able to access the maternity services she needs. Our priorities for 2018 include improving quality and safety, developing community midwifery teams and increasing access to anomaly scans. There are challenges in that regard but we intend to build capacity in our ultrasound services and additional funding has this year been provided to the national women and infants health programme to develop a more equitable and consistent antenatal screening service. The joint committee also made important recommendations regarding counselling and support facilities for women during and after pregnancy. I wish to inform the Dáil that the Government has agreed that I will return to it in the coming weeks to seek approval for a series of measures to further support women and improve access to counselling, contraception and perinatal care. I have established a group under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer to address the ancillary recommendations and formulate an effective and comprehensive response to the issues raised by the committee. Work is under way to consider the nature and scope of a free contraception service and what the introduction of such a service would involve. That has thus far established that provision of free access to contraception methods, which is currently limited to those with eligibility through the primary care reimbursement services, would require enabling primary legislation. Work to consider costs and other implications in that regard is continuing. If our underlying principle is that abortion should be safe, legal and rare, we must do all we can to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and support women in every way. That will be the focus of the proposals I will bring to Government in approximately one month’s time. The establishment of a legislative framework for the regulation of termination of pregnancy is a serious and challenging undertaking but it must be done because we cannot deal with the complexities of women’s health and lives through a few rigid lines in Bunreacht na hÉireann. As we embark on a debate to replace a constitutional provision with a legislative framework, it is understandable that people would want to know what would follow that change. However, I wish to re-emphasise that any discussion about legislation is merely hypothetical unless a referendum to remove the eighth amendment is passed. This morning, I am publishing a short policy paper, which the Government approved at its meeting yesterday. That document updates Members and the public on the work being done by my Department on the recommendations of the all-party committee. It affirms the intention to permit termination of pregnancy in cases where the life or health of a pregnant woman is at risk, with no distinction between risk from physical or mental health. It confirms that a process similar to that set out in the 2013 Act would be required, whereby in such cases assessments would be made by two appropriate medical practitioners. It proposes to make provision for access to termination of pregnancy on an emergency basis on the assessment of one medical practitioner. It proposes to permit termination of pregnancy on the grounds of a foetal condition which is likely to lead to death before or shortly after birth. In such cases, two appropriate medical practitioners would be involved in the assessment, in recognition of the fact that those complex medical cases are currently managed by multidisciplinary teams. Women in those awful, heart-breaking situations will consider different options. Many will choose to continue with the pregnancy, while others may not. In those cases, the woman and her doctors are best placed to make such a decision and I trust them to do so. In line with the recommendation of the all-party committee, it is proposed to permit termination up to 12 weeks of pregnancy without specific indication. However, I am proposing the introduction of a time period that is required to elapse between the assessment by a medical practitioner and the procedure being carried out. Contrary to some assertions, such provision would not make Ireland an outlier internationally, although I accept it represents a quantum leap from the current position, whereby we have one of the most restrictive regimes in respect of termination and are pegged at a similar level to Saudi Arabia. The proposed legislation is not without restriction. I believe it reasonable for there to be a brief period of time after the woman has her first consultation with her doctor in order to allow all the options to be considered and to facilitate informed consent. Informed consent is not an unusual medical principle. Only medical practitioners on the register of the Medical Council would be permitted to assess and, where appropriate, carry out a termination. Such medical practitioners are subject to the professional and ethical standards of the Medical Council and are governed by the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. It is important to note that doctors operate in a regulated profession and, when considering any structure that may be put in place to operate termination of pregnancy in Ireland, it is important to understand that the normal medical ethics and best practice which we highly value - and recognise are practised by our doctors - will apply. Where a foetal condition is likely to lead to death before or shortly after birth, or where maternal life or health is at risk, it is proposed that a gestational limit would not be included. Attending medical practitioners are best placed to make assessments and decisions on how to best proceed based on individual clinical situations. However, the spectre of late or full-term abortions is not the reality and is offensive to our medics. It is important to be clear and truthful that, in cases where the foetus is viable, early delivery and the full range of neonatal care are the reality. Members should not take my word for that but, rather, should talk to those working in our maternity hospitals. We should not misinform the public on that reality. Although termination of pregnancy would be lawful in the circumstances set out, it is proposed to retain the offence of intentional destruction of the unborn in defined circumstances. Abortion will remain unlawful in Ireland outside of the defined circumstances in any applicable legislation. However, a woman who procures or seeks to procure a termination of pregnancy for herself would not be guilty of an offence. We should not seek to criminalise vulnerable women in such situations. It is proposed to provide in legislation for a number of issues not covered by the recommendations of the joint committee. These would include setting out provisions similar to those in the 2013 Act on consent and permitting conscientious objection. In line with the 2013 Act, it is also proposed to require certification by the appropriate medical practitioners in all cases of termination of pregnancy, and notification of each procedure by the medical practitioner to the Minister for Health. Similarly, it is proposed that provision would be made for a formal review process for a woman in certain defined circumstances. Reports on notifications and reviews would be published annually by the Minister and the HSE, respectively, as is currently the case under the 2013 Act. I have outlined the Government's position and thinking on the issue but I wish to be clear that the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is not about what provisions we think legislation on termination of pregnancy should contain. Rather, it is about giving the citizens of Ireland the opportunity to exercise their democratic right to determine what is in our Constitution, which contains the founding principles of our State. I do not doubt the motivations or sincerity of those who wish to retain the eighth amendment. In fact, I do not doubt that we share some motivations. I do not like labels but I consider myself pro-life. I do not know anyone who is not. I do not know any woman or doctor who is not. I share the desire for the unborn to be protected in every way possible but that desire does not and cannot negate reality. The retention of the eighth amendment would not negate the fact that abortion is already a reality in this country and for Irish women. Retaining the eighth amendment will not prevent it from happening. If the purpose of the eighth amendment was to stop abortions in Ireland and to stop Irish women accessing abortions, it did not achieve that. All it achieved was pain and suffering. In this country, whether we like to hear it, denying reality has at times become a national bad habit. Denying realities does not make them go away. Instead it just leads to hurt and harm. Not only is the reality of abortion not going away, it is one that is now risking more hurt and harm to our women. We have to address that reality and it is possible to do so with compassion, with consideration and with care. Now, as we kick off this debate today, a debate to empower the Irish people to have their say, as we sit here in these comfortable brown leather chairs in Dáil Éireann, think of the nine Irish women in our ports and airports today heading off on that lonely cruel journey. Think of the three women, at least, in their homes, their bedrooms or wherever else taking the abortion pill today without any medical support. They are the women I am thinking about today. I commend the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill to the House. I look forward to the debate and hope we can have cross-party and cross-group co-operation to facilitate the people of Ireland having their sovereign say on this matter in the month of May. Let us let the people have the debate and let us let the people make their decision.";NULL
2305;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Billy Kelleher;Fianna Fáil;I welcome the opportunity to speak on this particular issue. It is something that has been debated in this Chamber on numerous occasions. However, we are inextricably on a journey to allow the Irish people to arbitrate finally on Article 40.3.3° and to deliberate on it in the meantime, not only in this House but in broader society. I hope the debate is one that, as so far to date, is understanding and comprehending of varying views but at the same time acknowledging that the status quo cannot remain. We do have to delete Article 40.3.3° and address it through legislation as is proposed in the published Bill. I refer to Emma who is 24 years old. She says that when a woman gets to the airport, she gets on the flight, known to be the very early flight that people take. When waiting to board the plane she can see the other women. They all know she is there for the same reason. Emma says there is an immediate sense of shame that comes with that. It is overwhelming. However, the worst part was when she got back to the airport afterwards. She had to wait for five hours to get the plane home while sitting there feeling she had just committed a crime. She was so traumatised by the travel experience that she still cannot wrap her head around it. That is Emma's story. She is a 24 year old Irish citizen who last year travelled to England for a termination. It is against that backdrop that we are debating this particular issue. As the Minister has outlined, we do have abortion in this country. Article 40.3.3° has not prevented abortion taking place. It has just displaced it to the UK, the Netherlands, other European countries and sometimes to the United States. When we sat in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and looked at this, I hope I went there with an open mind in the context of listening to the evidence, hearing what the witnesses had to say when they presented, both clinical experts and witnesses who had a view as to what should be done in terms of Article 40.3.3°. Varying views were expressed by those witnesses and there were varying opinions within the committee itself. However, the overwhelming view of committee members was that Article 40.3.3° could not and should not be retained and there was a need for us to legislate to allow for lawful terminations in this country. There are many reasons as to why that is the case. However, the overwhelming reason was that we were jeopardising the health of Irish women. We were treating pregnant Irish women as second class citizens in this State. The minute an Irish woman becomes pregnant, she no longer has control over her own health care. It is dependent on others as well at that stage. That was a strong view expressed by clinicians of varying professional backgrounds on this particular issue. Looking at where we are in respect of trying to address the issue, the first thing we have to do if we are to bring about change is to repeal Article 40.3.3°. The Minister has published his policy document which reflects broadly the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution recommendations. The reality is though, unless Article 40.3.3° is changed all those policy papers and positions cannot be implemented. There can be no change and let us be very honest. Many people have expressed huge compassion with young girls who have been raped, women carrying a child that will die at birth and women who have been impregnated by a relative. They have expressed huge compassion. However, the reality is unless we change Article 40.3.3°, that compassion is only compassion and nothing else can be done to address their pain and hurt. I urge that when we debate this issue, not only here but in broader civic society and during the referendum itself, we have to be honest. If I stand up and say I have huge sympathy for Irish women in the context of them having to go abroad to address the issue of fatal foetal abnormality, to have a termination in another country at a vulnerable time, to have to bring back their baby in the boot of their car or FedExed back to their house, then the only way that issue can be addressed is by amending Article 40.3.3°. Some people ask can we trust politicians if we amend Article 40.3.3°. The corollary of that is they are basically saying we cannot trust women. All we are going to do is to legislate to allow a woman to make a decision. I have to say, personally, I strongly believe we must legislate and the only way we can legislate is by repealing Article 40.3.3° itself. Do we trust women? Do we trust the women who carry us for nine months, grimace in pain to bring us into this world, nurture us, care for us and who cry for us? At the same time, we as a society are saying if anything happens to a woman and she, for whatever reason, cannot continue with the pregnancy, she has to leave this country, leave the State and seek a termination abroad. Do we say to a woman who has been diagnosed with cervical cancer, that she cannot have treatment in this country? Do we say that she first of all has to leave this country, go to England, terminate the pregnancy and them come back to continue with her treatment? If we do not amend Article 40.3.3° that is effectively what we are saying to that woman diagnosed with cervical cancer. Do we say to a woman who is pregnant as a result of a vile rape that she must carry the pregnancy to full term? If she does not, and if she self-medicates and brings about a miscarriage, she is potentially criminalised. She could get a custodial sentence of 14 years. However, the rapist could get a criminal conviction of eight years. That is what we are saying today in the context of the legislation currently on the Statute Book as passed in this Parliament and in the context of the Constitution itself. Do I say to a girl of 14 that she must carry the pregnancy to full term and that the State would only allow a termination if she is going to kill herself? That is what we say to a young 14 year old girl. That is what we said to a 14 year old girl in the context of the X case. Do I say to a girl who has been violated by a person she should be able to trust that she must carry her father's child to full term? That is what we are saying as it stands in the context of Article 40.3.3° and the legislation that has grown from that. If a girl is raped and impregnated by her father, the State will not do anything. The problem must be sent off to England. I find that quite offensive, being truthful. What do I say to a woman who is so delighted and excited by the fact that she is pregnant she tells everybody about the joy and the fulfilment of that and then, suddenly, she gets the devastating diagnosis that she has a child that has a fatal foetal abnormality. The child will die at birth or just before or just after. She will get congratulations and the comments on her looking fabulous and questions of whether it is a boy or a girl. All the time she knows she is carrying a child that will die. That had a profound impact on the members of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that I sat with during the debate on this issue. Some of the members still have said they cannot support repeal. I respect it, but that in itself had a profound impact. The reality is that unless we repeal it, I can do nothing for that woman, nothing. Nobody else inside here can do anything for her either. She will still have to go to England to terminate that pregnancy. She will still have to bring it back in the boot of the car or courier it back. Testimony from the witnesses who had to go on that very lonely and sad journey to Belfast, Manchester or Birmingham really tore at the heartstrings. I refer to when people are making these decisions and when we are having that debate. I urge them to be mindful of their language and sensitive to the fact that many women have gone abroad wanting to have that pregnancy. However, because they could not continue with it for the reason that it would die at birth, they felt they had to end it for the reasons I have outlined. I urge colleagues to be mindful of their language and sensitive to the fact that many women have gone abroad, women whose pregnancies were wanted but who could not continue with them because their babies would have died at birth. They felt that they had to end their pregnancies for the reasons I have outlined. The journey that such women have had to take, if nothing else, is enough to convince me that we need to repeal Article 40.3.3° and introduce legislation that would allow for terminations here. In terms of the 12-week gestational limit, people have asked if it is contrary to the public view and too liberal. It has been suggested that Article 40.3.3° could be amended but the proposals put forward by the joint committee and published in the Minister for Health's policy document this morning might undermine the argument. We must be very honest about this. Are we to say to the Irish people that they should remove Article 40.3.3° but that we will leave a lacuna in the context of the debate and not say anything about what legislation is likely to be introduced in the event of the them deciding to strike down the aforementioned article? In advance of this debate and during the joint committee's hearings, almost everyone was asking what would replace Article 40.3.3°. This is what we are going to put forward but we cannot say definitively that it will be passed. That will depend on the Dáil. There could be a general election in the meantime or soon afterwards but it will be the Oireachtas that decides what will be in the legislation. This relates back to my original question. Do we trust politicians to legislate? Some people - including politicians themselves - are saying that they do not trust politicians to legislate but what they are really saying is that they do not trust women. I firmly believe, having listened to all of the evidence and engaged in debates in this House, in broader society and in the committee rooms, that Article 40.3.3° has done a huge disservice to and caused a lot of pain for many women for a very long time. The figures are there to prove it if people do not believe me. Somewhere between 160,000 and 180,000 women have gone to the United Kingdom alone since 1983. Today, nine or ten women will leave Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports to travel to the UK for a termination. This evening, three girls or women will take abortion pills. They will put a towel down, lie on a bathroom floor and induce a miscarriage. That will happen in houses throughout this country tonight. Nobody can deny that it is happening. Terminations are taking place. They are unlawful in this country but they are taking place in bathrooms by way of abortion pills. They are also taking place lawfully in the United Kingdom because women are forced to leave this country. In all logic but, more importantly, in compassion and understanding, Article 40.3.3° must be replaced and we must be allowed to legislate. In terms of whether politicians will do the right thing, we are here at the gift of the Irish people and if the people feel strongly on the issue in the context of the type of legislation that should follow on from the referendum, I am quite sure that all of these issues will be consistently debated in the years ahead in the proper forum, during general election campaigns and in the context of parliamentary debates in this House. Let us be very honest - that is how laws are made. I cannot understand the argument or suggestion that politicians would act against the interests of Irish people. The vast majority of us in this House, whether male or female, will act in the bests interests of Irish citizens. To date, however, we have been unable to act in the best interests of Irish women because of Article 40.3.3°. As we debate, listen and engage, we must be mindful of the language we use and conscious of the fact that if we use very harsh words to describe what happens during a termination or try to evoke emotions beyond the reality, we are insulting and hurting women who have already been through a traumatic experience. As I said previously, at least 160,000 women have had terminations in the UK. Tonight, three girls will have a termination in a bedroom or bathroom, having procured abortion pills on the Internet. They may be on their own, with nobody else knowing about it. The issue of abortion pills was very much to the fore in the committee's deliberations, chiefly because Ms Justice Laffoy indicated that the Citizens' Assembly did not have enough time to fully address it. She said that the evidence towards the end of the assembly's deliberations showed quite clearly that the issue of abortion pills would have to be examined and she urged our committee to do so. We looked at the issue in detail and came to the broad view that we would have to legislate for lawful terminations in this country up to 12 weeks. We came to that view on the basis of the evidence we heard from various individuals and because the use of abortion pills is very prevalent in this country. It is estimated that up to 1,800 women per year procure and use such pills. It has been argued that the 12-week gestational limit recommendation could undermine the campaign to repeal Article 40.3.3°. However, that gestational limit is not out of step with the norms in Europe. The gestational limit in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Germany is 12 weeks. In Italy, the limit is 90 days and in Luxembourg and Norway it is 12 weeks. The limit in Portugal is ten weeks, in Slovakia it is 12 weeks, in Sweden it is 18 weeks, while in Switzerland it is 12 weeks. The limit in Austria is three months, in Bulgaria it is 12 weeks, in Estonia it is 11 weeks and in Finland it is 12 weeks. In France, the limit is now 12 weeks. In that country it was originally ten weeks but it was extended to 12 weeks in 2001. The limit in Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia and Lithuania is 12 weeks, in Macedonia it is ten weeks and in the Netherlands it is 21 weeks. In Romania, the limit is 14 weeks, in Russia it is 12 weeks, in Slovenia it is ten weeks, in Spain it is 14 weeks, in Turkey it is ten weeks and in the UK it is 24 weeks. We did not just randomly choose 12 weeks. Our decision was based on the fact that it is within the first trimester and that abortion pills are taken to induce a termination up to the eleventh or twelfth week of pregnancy. Abortion pills are being taken here at a rate of at least three per day. That figure could be higher if women are accessing pills through websites we cannot trace. In that context, the committee felt that if we do not allow for terminations up to 12 weeks, girls or women who find themselves in difficulty, who are bleeding or experiencing other medical complications having taken an abortion pill, would be reluctant to seek medical treatment because it would still be a criminal offence. That was another very important factor in our deliberations on the 12-week limit. While the committee's work and final recommendations were not unanimous, the majority view was that Article 40.3.3° should simply be repealed but we understand that this Bill, as published by the Minister, accommodates our view while also acknowledging the concerns of Ms Justice Laffoy. It still allows for judicial oversight in the event of Article 40.3.3° being deleted and legislation being passed in this House. The committee was concerned that if the Government were to go beyond repeal simpliciter, there should be some form of judicial oversight. What has been published by the Minister, to be debated by the Irish people and the legislation that will flow from that, if it is passed, will have judicial oversight, which is important in any modern, democratic republic. On the question of the terminations, where and how they will take place and the policies governing same, many are claiming that this will overwhelm our already stretched health service. However, the evidence from obstetricians, gynaecologists, GPs and others suggested that this is not the case. They argued that they would easily be able to cope with transferring what is happening to Irish women in the UK back to Ireland. Women would not have to travel to the UK but could have terminations here. It has been argued by some that if abortion is made available here, there will be a major increase in the numbers having terminations. I find that argument offensive, to say the least. It is to suggest that if there is an abortion clinic at the end of the street, a woman will traipse down there after the weekend to have an abortion. The idea is that if abortion is available, women will just turn up and have one. That is being expressed by people who believe women will make these decisions very lightly. I have met many women who have had an abortion and nobody took the decision lightly. Whether it would entail a journey to England or a visit to her general practitioner, women do not make that decision lightly. When we are debating this issue, we must remain within the facts. This year, 3,600 women will travel to the UK and at least 1,800 to 2,000 women will take the abortion pill in this country. They are the facts. If we legislate and allow for lawful terminations in this country up to 12 weeks in general, and beyond that time in the areas of fatal foetal abnormality and the health and life of the woman, our health services will easily be able to cope. They should be able to cope with it because it is primarily a health care issue for women in the first place. I welcome the Bill. I speak in a personal capacity although I am the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on health. I contributed to the Oireachtas committee hearings along with five party colleagues. We had varying views but the view I expressed is one in which I strongly, firmly and passionately believe, namely, that we cannot allow ourselves to turn our backs on Irish girls and women in times of need. It is time to change and to repeal Article 40.3.3°.;NULL
2306;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Mary Lou McDonald;Sinn Féin;"Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus leis an Aire. Tá sé thar am athghairm a dhéanamh ar an ochtú leasú. Tá sé in am dúinn muinín a bheith againn i mná na hÉireann. Tá sé in am dúinn san Oireachtas seo ár bpoist agus ár n-obair a dhéanamh. I warmly welcome the publication of this Bill. It is only appropriate at the outset to acknowledge and commend the work of our Oireachtas colleagues on the all-party committee, under the stewardship of Senator Catherine Noone. I acknowledge my party colleagues, Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Jonathan O'Brien and Senator Paul Gavan, for their tremendous efforts. The repeal of the eighth amendment is an absolute necessity to ensure that women have access to proper and appropriate health care. The truth is that the eighth amendment should never have been placed in our Constitution in the first place. It was a mistake and bitter experience over decades has amply demonstrated this. It is time to own up to that mistake and to correct it. It was - let it be said - born out of an entirely sexist view of the world and the conservative social values that dominated our society for decades. The power and influence of the church and its strict reactionary doctrine were central to that system. It was the dogma that produced the now infamous Magdalen laundries and mother and baby homes, when women were incarcerated against their will behind high walls and wrought iron gates for the supposed offence of becoming pregnant outside of wedlock, forced into slave labour under the shadow of the cross. Their children were taken away from them, they were told they were a source of shame, that they were sinners and were not fit to live amongst the general population. This was the cost of a social system in which the primary function of woman was to bear children and to do so at any cost. The insertion of the eighth amendment into our Constitution in 1983 was an extension of that system. That Ireland is gone and good riddance, and the eighth amendment, too, must go. It is essential to recall the real cost of the eighth amendment to real women and girls. In the 1992 X case, a suicidal girl of 14, the child victim of rape, was prevented by the High Court from travelling abroad to obtain an abortion. The eighth amendment has caused countless women and families with the trauma of a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality to be forced to make a harrowing journey abroad. It has created an alphabet roll call of women's misery, women who in many cases sought and could only find relief in international courts and tribunals to recognise their suffering and the cruelty of our State. It cost the life of Savita Halappanavar, a 31 year old who, while miscarrying, was denied the abortion that would have saved her life. In 2015, a pregnant woman was kept on life support for 24 long days after she was declared medically brain dead, because a foetal heartbeat was detected in her womb. When her family asked that life support be removed, their request was denied because of the eighth amendment. This was in spite of the fact that the foetus had no chance of survival. It took an appeal by the woman's family to the High Court for her life support to be switched off. Even in death, the eighth amendment could rob a woman of her dignity. Some people will say that these are the hard cases, the outliers and exceptions. They will argue that hard cases make bad law. I say that these cases are the hardest, most cruel face of the eighth amendment. I say that our bad law made these hard cases. I say that these women and these cases are, in the very first instance, the reason to repeal the eighth amendment. We as a society must demand and ensure that there are no more hard cases, no more Savitas, no more traumatised women known to us in the public domain as letters of the alphabet. That is our first duty. We must assert clearly that the State will not force a rape victim to carry a pregnancy to term. We must demand that women and families faced with the devastating diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality are no longer denied care, comfort and choice here in their home country. We must assert that doctors must be free to do their job and must be able to make medical decisions in the interests of women without a threat of criminal sanction. We must ensure that health care choices - life and death choices - are not skewed or delayed while medics seek advice from constitutional lawyers. We must be in no doubt that the eighth amendment has had that chilling effect. I thank the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, for his words this morning. It is essential that he has emphasised the fact that the courts still feature. Access to and the review of the courts are still applicable to any legislation that might come through this House. I say to those who would scaremonger on this count, ""Shame on you."" Anyone who argues that the courts have been written out of the scenario, that this is some kind of carte blanche for untrustworthy politicians, is willfully misleading public opinion.";NULL

On the legislation that might follow, there is no doubt that in the course of the public debate, attention will correctly turn to what might or might not find legislative expression. That should not obscure the experiences of the eighth amendment. Let that not happen. The Minister has indicated in a sensible manner that he might be fully faithful, or largely faithful, to the findings of the all-party Oireachtas committee. That to me makes sense. The committee's deliberations were a collaborative exercise and the recommendations are clear. I note the proposition of 12 weeks to which the Minister and Deputy Kelleher referred. I acknowledge that it found expression initially as the solution to victims of rape and how they might be afforded the service they need in a compassionate, thoughtful and real way. I also note that it is based on the absolute reality of abortion pills, which women and girls are taking with no medical supervision, and on the utter certainty of the medical jeopardy this presents. I wish to acknowledge that the 12-week proposition is challenging for some people because it represents a marked departure in practice. I am thankful that we will have time for people to debate that proposition in a calm and informed way, should it come before the House. It is a proposition that Sinn Féin is considering and I will bring it to an Ard-Fheis of my party in advance of the legislation coming before this House. I despise the term ""abortion on demand"". I wish that people would stop using it. It is deeply offensive to women and mothers. Women do not demand abortions or go to a clinic and flippantly, after an indiscretion, make a decision to have an abortion. I appeal that the public debate does not become so debased and disrespectful to women and girls that this type of rhetoric is thrown around. The issue of trust has been raised. Frankly, I would understand a mistrust in the political system and establishment on this issue, not because the system has acted hastily but because it has sat on its hands and delayed for decades. We are not asking for an inordinate or inappropriate level of trust in us, although we are public representatives. We are asking people to trust themselves, to trust the evidence and to understand decades of real, lived experience. On ""Morning Ireland"" this morning I heard someone speaking from what was termed a pro-life position and discussing public opinion. That person noted - I believe honestly - that public opinion is in a process around the proposition from Government. However, there is no support in public opinion for traumatising rape victims and coercing them to carry a pregnancy to term. There is no support in public opinion to make exiles of traumatised and vulnerable women and couples and families with a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality. I believe that Irish public opinion no longer tolerates the view that women cannot get dignity and recognition or exercise their rights in Ireland, and that if they want them they should go to the European courts or the United Nations. I believe Irish public opinion has had its fill of that, and in time, when the proposition is put in an atmosphere of respect, calm and tolerance, that the right decision will be made, the historic wrong will be corrected and the eighth amendment will be repealed.";NULL
2309;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Gerry Adams;Sinn Féin;"This referendum to repeal the eighth amendment is fundamentally about trust. First and foremost it is about the willingness of our society to trust women and to accept that women are equal citizens with a right to health and to make health decisions for themselves. It is also about trusting our medical professionals faced with difficult situations and decisions, and it is about trusting the electorate to come to a decision that removes from the Constitution an amendment which should never have been there in the first place. The issue of women’s health should never be a matter for a constitution.  It should be legislated for in the normal way through the Oireachtas. I welcome the publication today of the Government’s policy paper. Sinn Féin will study it closely. Tá mé fíorbhuíoch den Aire fá choinne a fhocail inniu. I commend the Government on the proposed wording for the referendum. It allocates responsibility for legislating in a very simple and clear way, and provides that women’s health will be legislated for in the Oireachtas and by the Government, as is right. The eighth amendment prohibits access to basic medical treatment that should be available to women in any developed society. It is unjust and we as legislators have a responsibility to end that injustice. The business of the State should be to ensure women have access to proper health services if they need them and if they choose to avail of them. The State has a responsibility to support women. None of us should try to fool ourselves.  Abortion is a reality here. Every day, here and in neighbouring states, Irish women are having abortions. Ten will leave today, and every day, for that reason. In my own constituency of Louth and east Meath, the official figures tell us that at least 83 women travelled to Britain for an abortion in 2016. In Dublin 1,175 women travelled that year, and across this State, at least 3,265 women travelled to Britain for an abortion in 2016. It is estimated that in the past 40 years, at least 170,000 Irish women travelled to other states for abortions. That means as many as 3,300 women travelled for abortions during that time from Louth. Thousands more are now using abortion pills that can be accessed over the Internet. They do so without medical supervision. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, speaking in the Dáil in January revealed a 62% increase in the number of women from this State contacting one particular online provider over a five-year period. The number seeking pills increased from 548 women in 2010 to 1,438 in 2015. Do we want this to continue or do we want a mature society, tolerant and compassionate, open and inclusive and based on equality? Alternatively, are the attitudes from the time of the industrial schools, the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes to prevail, when women were treated as chattels with no rights or protections? If we vote ""No"", we will be dismissing and condemning women. The victims of rape and incest and women with fatal foetal abnormalities are not anonymous people. They are not statistics. These are our family members, our friends and neighbour and our workmates. They need to be treated with love and compassion. Winning this referendum will take hard work and leadership. I appeal for a reasoned, respectful and sympathetic debate. We must not and cannot let women down again. An uachtarán Shinn Féin, Deputy McDonald, speaking on this issue in January described the eighth amendment as a constitutional coup and the reactionary codification of the suppression of women. She is right. Níl aon áit ag sláinte na mban sa Bhunreacht. Ceist phríobháideach í idir bhean agus a dochtúir. Tá freagracht agus dualgas orainn maidir leis an bhfeachtas chun an t-ochtú leasú a aisghairm agus, mar reachtóirí, reachtaíocht a chruthú má tá saoránaigh in aghaidh an Achta sin. It is time for women to make their own decisions and for us to support them to do this. Bí fíorchinnte nach mbeidh saoirse ar bith ann gan saoirse na mban. It is time to trust women on this issue. Any decision about women's health must be made by women and their doctors. It is time to trust ourselves.";NULL
2310;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Eoin Ó Broin;Sinn Féin;Yesterday thousands of people marched through the streets of Dublin to mark International Women's Day. Men and women, young and old, of all political persuasions and none, were represented. They were united in a single belief, which is that the time has come to trust women. For decades, as other speakers have outlined, this State has failed women. It has failed to ensure that they have access to the health care they deserve. We have told ourselves the lie that the eighth amendment made our society a better place and that it protected women and children. Of course, the truth is very different. It put women's lives at risk. It forced tens of thousands of Irish women to travel abroad for terminations. It caused, and it continues to cause, great harm to our mothers, sisters and friends. Today marks a very important moment in our history. Finally, after decades of denial, we are reaching the point where we are going to trust women. To be a Member of the Oireachtas at this time is both an enormous responsibility and an enormous privilege. I welcome the wording of the referendum Bill. I also welcome all of the work of the Minister and his Department in bringing us to this point and that of the members of the special Oireachtas committee. The issue of abortion should never have been dealt with in the Constitution. Details of any policy area, particularly complex issues of health care, should be dealt with in legislation and policy. That is what the referendum wording proposes and that is why I will be enthusiastically campaigning for it to pass. It is also faithful to the work of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. I also want to welcome the Government policy paper published today. In my view, it provides a credible pathway to a more humane legal framework on the issue of abortion. It recognises that no woman's health, including psychological health, should be put at risk by forcing her to carry to full term. It also recognises that no family should be forced through the trauma of fatal foetal abnormality and that every family's individual decision must be respected. It further recognises that no woman should be criminalised for having an abortion. These are positions which the majority of people in this State, I believe, will firmly support. The policy paper also recognises that in order to provide terminations in cases of rape or incest, an unrestricted period of access to terminations must be provided in consultation with the medical profession. As the House will be aware, Sinn Féin's current policy does not include this provision and, like other parties and sections of society, more generally, people are anxious about this proposal. I accept and fully understand that but my strong personal belief is that if one does not believe a survivor of rape or incest should be forced to carry to full term, then this is the only way in which this can be achieved. As Deputy McDonald stated, Sinn Féin will be discussing this issue in the coming weeks. I am hopeful that those of us already convinced can persuade our party colleagues of the merits of this view.;NULL

2313;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Jan O'Sullivan;Labour Party;"Aontaím leis an Teachta McDonald go bhfuil sé ceart an cheist seo a chur ar mhuintir na hÉireann arís. Tá an t-am tagtha. Tá mé cinnte nach é Bunreacht na hÉireann an áit cheart don ábhar seo. I welcome the fact that the Government has published its legislation and its paper on possible implementation of legislation should the referendum be successful. As somebody who campaigned against the amendment in 1983, I welcome this momentous day. It has taken a long time to reach this point. We have heard much about what will happen if we repeal the eighth amendment. We also need to reflect on what will happen if we do not repeal the eighth amendment. If we do not repeal the eighth amendment, if we keep Article 40.3.3° in the Constitution, we will continue to have the current situation. We will continue to have a variety of cases, regardless of the letters we attribute to them. We have heard about Miss A, Miss B, Miss C, Miss X, Miss Y and Miss D, the late Savita Halappanavar, Ms Amanda Mellet and many others. Apart from the ones we know about, there are thousands of Irish women who have had terminations since 1983. The assessed figure is that 170,216 travelled to Britain during that period. As others have said, that represents approximately nine women every day travelling outside of their own country - away from their own homes, support systems, families and, in many cases, children - to go to another country to have their pregnancies terminated. People seem to be okay about tolerating that into the future. The position is not going to change and all of the evidence suggests that we will continue to have the same kind of termination statistics in this country as other comparable countries. We have abortion in Ireland. We just do not have it on the soil of Ireland in terms of termination by medical means. We have it in lonely bedrooms with pills bought on the Internet by approximately three women every day. I expect that figure will probably rise because women are becoming more aware of this as an alternative. We really should not close our eyes to what will happen if we retain Article 40.3.3°. We will not suddenly stop what has been happening in the past number of years. No doubt that will continue, but in a context where we will have the kind of cases that temporarily made people in Ireland stand up and take notice and that, for example, led to the 1992 referendum following the Miss X case. I very much remember the campaign at that time. I recall The Irish Times cartoon - if one wants to call it a cartoon because it seems a misnomer in this case - with a 14 year old girl with a barbed wire fence all around the map of Ireland. That young girl had been raped. The rapist was convicted and, I think, got out of jail after three years. She was only 14. Basically, the Constitution had to be changed subsequently to allow for freedom to travel and freedom of information but we still have the restriction in respect of the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn child, which is in Article 40.3.3°. We were all hugely affected by the death of Savita Halappanavar. It made us recognise the reality. That reality was described extremely well, not only by Professor Arulkumaran, who chaired the investigation into the death of Savita, but also in much of the testimony that those of us who were privileged to be on the Oireachtas committee heard from medical people. I refer, for example to the master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, who described the difficulty for an obstetrician in circumstances where a woman is ill - she might have sepsis - and where he or she must determine the exact point at which the woman's health is in danger and then that at which her life is in danger. That is an impossible position for the medical profession. It is a much more impossible position for the woman who is in the situation and her loved ones. We cannot allow that to continue. If we do not repeal the eighth amendment, if we do not remove Article 40.3.3°, that will continue to be the case and there will be an impossible situation whereby if the mother's life is in danger, the medical profession will be able to intervene but if it is her health that is in danger, it will not be able to do so. The master of Holles Street and others - the joint committee heard a great deal of medical evidence - described how difficult it is to determine when that to which I refer happens. They also indicated that it happens quickly in many cases and that there is not enough time to intervene. I was particularly moved by the medical evidence. I am convinced that we need to regulate abortion in the context of medical care in this country. That has to be the situation. The recommendations of the joint committee are clear in that regard. In case people feel that we somehow or other heard from prejudiced medical professionals or individuals who hold particular opinions, we heard evidence from two current and two former masters of Irish maternity hospitals, two national medical professional bodies, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the World Health Organization, four specialists in maternal foetal medicine - three from Ireland and one from the United Kingdom - two specialists in perinatal psychiatry and the chief investigator into the death of Savita Halappanavar. The consensus of those experts is that the eighth amendment is the central barrier to the provision of best practice abortion and maternity care in Ireland and should be removed and that the current law, which includes criminal provisions, is overly restrictive, overly prescriptive and prevents doctors from being able to provide the highest standard of reproductive health care to pregnant woman. This medical evidence is particularly significant. Deputy Kelleher referred earlier to how the medical profession will not be overwhelmed should we pass the referendum and introduce the legislation proposed by the Government. I had the privilege to chair this week a briefing meeting at which Deputy Kelleher and Senator Noone spoke. We also heard from Dr. Maeve Eogan of the Rotunda and Dr. Mark Murphy of the Irish College of General Practitioners. The evidence of Dr. Murphy was very clear. He had analysed the statistics around the number of likely medical and surgical terminations, respectively, and how even if only a minority of general practitioners opted in, it would still be very easy to deal with the kind of numbers we are talking about. It is important, therefore, not to have scaremongering and to have clear, factual evidence when we debate the issue. We must debate it in an atmosphere of honesty. While there has been a great deal of talk about respect, with which I agree, there must also be honesty. The facts we put out there must be real and based on evidence. Unfortunately, I have heard statements adduced as evidence which are simply not true. We understand that this is a matter for the people of Ireland and that it is a question citizens will decide. I hope they will be given the kind of honest information they require. Part of that involves ensuring the kind of information we got at the committee is made available to people. For example, I refer to the pill, which the Citizens' Assembly suggested specifically the committee should address. We did so. The evidence is that women are accessing abortion pills on the Internet and taking them without access to medical supervision. I support the recommendations that there must be a medical context for all of this, largely through the GP service. We are talking about a situation in which even if women have complications, they feel they cannot go to their doctor or talk about what has happened to them. Certainly, the statistics on abortion in Britain show that Irish women have later terminations than women in Britain. That is not good. If there is access within our own country in the medical context, we will have the care we need. I welcome the Minister's remarks on the ancillary recommendations of the committee around issues like contraception, sex education and ensuring care exists. Finance will not be a barrier to access to contraception, I hope. The international statistics show that where one has after care and advice on contraception, there are reduced numbers of second or third abortions. The international information provided to the committee showed that in many countries the abortion rate reduced after the introduction of legal abortion. Romania was one of the countries referred to. There is no information to suggest the rates will go up in Ireland. In fact, it is likely they will stay somewhat similar and maybe even reduce because evidence from other countries shows women having access to the kind of wrap-around care and advice reduces the number of women who go for termination. The Dutch model is a good one. We had evidence at the committee on abortion in the Netherlands where it has been legally available since 1984. However, the abortion rate in the Netherlands is one of the lowest in Europe at 8.6 per 1,000 in 2015. One of the factors to which that is attributed is the high use of contraception in the adult population. The Dutch model also includes a waiting period, which the Minister is also suggesting. Certainly, I have no objection to that, albeit we did not discuss it or make any specific recommendations in that regard at the committee. It appears to be a successful part of the Dutch model. There are models there and we have a great deal of information as to how we can deliver care for women when they need it in these situations. I turn to some of the particular evidence that came before the committee in the context of what legislation might follow repeal and the recommendation of a 12-week gestational period as the cut-off point. I pay tribute to the three members of the committee who made that recommendation. I hope the Sinn Féin position will change on this. I welcome Deputy Ó Broin's statement but it is important for Sinn Féin to support the proposal. I was convinced by the evidence as were other members of the committee, in particular in the case of rape. It is unacceptable to put women through the trauma of having to prove they were raped. We have been told categorically that it is not possible to do it in time for the woman who has been raped to have a termination. Ms Noeline Blackwell of the Rape Crisis Centre and Dr. Maeve Eogan of the Rotunda Hospital were both very clear that there is no physical way to determine conclusively that a woman has been raped. There is also no legal way to deal with the issue within the timeframe. I refer to the evidence of Mr. Tom O’Malley, a legal expert who came before the committee. Discussing whether there would be a court decision in relation to rape, he said a number of important questions arose including, who would adjudicate; would the woman bear the burden of proving that she had been raped and, if so, what standard of proof would apply; should the alleged perpetrator be identified assuming his identity is known to the woman; would the alleged perpetrator, if identified, have a right to be heard, for example if he was a husband or partner and objected to the requested abortion; would the woman who claimed she had been raped by a named individual be entitled to immunity from civil or criminal proceedings in respect of that claim; would evidence of the abortion or a request for an abortion be admissible in any later criminal trial; is there a possibility in some cases that an adjudication process of this kind could end up being a criminal trial in everything but name; and should there be, in any case, an absolute requirement that the alleged rape be reported to gardaí. As such, there are huge questions around the issue of rape and most people who have doubts about what the legislation should contain but feel the eighth amendment is not appropriate would say that in the case of rape, a woman should be entitled to make the decision to have a termination of her pregnancy. Those of us around the committee were absolutely convinced of that from the evidence we heard. There is no way to provide for a woman who has been raped or is the victim of incest without establishing a safe period such as the 12-week period which has been recommended. There is no way to deal with rape as a matter of exception and we must be clear and honest about that. In conclusion, I quote from my party leader's contribution on the debate here on the recommendations of the committee. He said our laws must be practical, enforceable and humane. I want to live in a country that treats all its citizens, including its women, in a way that is practical, enforceable and humane. We should not fool ourselves, and nobody should be allowed to fool the public, that retaining Article 40.3.3° will somehow protect the country from the reality of abortion. Women need to be treated in their own country. They need to have the support of the medical profession, including doctors whom they trust. They also need the expertise of doctors in their own country. As a country, we have to be honest about this issue. It is simply wrong to suggest we do not have personal responsibility and rights in this area. This is a very personal matter. It is a personal issue for every woman who faces a decision, as well as for the loved ones around her. We would have a much better country if we gave people the freedom and space to make these kinds of personal decisions without trying to impose something from outside that simply cannot deal with the reality. There is nothing that will stop Irish women in very difficult circumstances from choosing a termination. I have quoted the Termination for Medical Reasons group before so I have not referred to it very much this time round. That group was the most persuasive in arguing why Article 40.3.3° should not be in the Constitution. The individuals concerned were about to have a wanted child and found that child's life would not last. They ended the pregnancy, which was never going to produce a child that would live. They had to go to a foreign country and bring back the ashes or body of the baby in an aeroplane, boot of a car or boat. They had no support within their own country. If it is only for those people, we need to remove Article 40.3.3°. We need to do a lot more than that, however. We need to face up to the reality. I hope the amendment to the Constitution will be made.";NULL
2314;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Ruth Coppinger;People Before Profit-Solidarity;"I am sharing time with Deputy Bríd Smith. Last night, I joined thousands of others on the march for International Women's Day. The key demand on that march was the repeal of the eighth amendment. There were many young people on the march. There were also older people. The marchers were primarily young, however, and the message was that a new generation does not want our past to be its future. They want to be able to have a democratic right to have a vote on this, which is the purpose of this referendum Bill. They do not want those who oppose that to play games with this legislation and try to delay it. Those people should at least stand for the democratic right of people to have a say on this. The march ended symbolically around Busáras, Connolly Station, Dublin Port and the airport road, where thousands of nameless women started their abortion journey. Today, there is no question but that the horrific cases of A, B, C, X, Y and Savita Halappanavar will resonate throughout our discussion. We want to end the early-morning flight mentioned by a previous speaker — the flight of shame — and recognise the right of women, including pregnant women, to control their own bodies. This is a very historic day. I would go so far as to say this is the most sought-after referendum that anybody could cite. It has been campaigned for over many years. The legislation is one of the most important civil, health and women's rights measures that will be introduced in this Dáil for many years. Considering that, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, one in three pregnancies is a crisis pregnancy, this issue affects quite a lot of people in society. It has been said already that the eighth amendment of 1983 was a constitutional coup. It was also a clerical coup because it was carried out, it would have to be said, at the behest of zealots of one particular religion. An interesting book by Dr. Andrew Rynne, who was a general practitioner at the time, lists the groups that called for the amendment, which included the Irish Catholic Doctors Guild, the Catholic Guild of Pharmacists and the Catholic Young Men's Society. These were the groups that made up the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign. Also included were the Catholic Nurses Guild of Ireland, the Federation of Christian Brothers and Other Secondary Schools Parents Association, the National Congress of Catholic Schools Parent Associations, the Council of Social Concern, the Irish Pro-Life Movement, Muintir na Tíre, and the National Association of the Ovulation Method in Ireland. We have lots of members in that. Also included were the Irish Responsible Society, the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, the Irish Association of Lawyers for the Defence of the Unborn. I think we know from where this emanated and we must correct this injustice now with this vote. For pregnant people to lose their constitutional rights is unacceptable. It is a blight on women's lives. It is a blight on the State's human rights record. It is a symbol of how women's sexuality has been controlled in this country for far too long and of the rigid roles to which women have been forced to adhere. To equate a woman with a fertilised egg, zygote, embryo or foetus is outrageous. It has led to the death and ill health of many people. I wish to quote a statement by Savita Halappanavar's mother after the death of her daughter: In an attempt to save a four-month old foetus, they killed my 30-year-old daughter. How is that fair? You tell me. The quotation is quite apt. The idea that the two should be equal is in question. The reality is that they were not equal. Women are subordinated if pregnant. The main aim of the eighth amendment was obviously to prevent abortion but there was mission creep into other areas, including women's consent or pregnant women having consent, alive or even dead. The amendment must go for that reason alone. This referendum is about removing that archaic law. We should remember, going into this, the opportunism of political parties bowing to the pressure of the zealots to have a referendum in 1983. According to Dr. Andrew Rynne, both of the largest political parties prostrated themselves in front of these pressure groups with reckless disregard for the consequences. Thirty-five years on, we are in a position to right that injustice. The claim has been made by those opposed to change that the eighth amendment has saved lives. We see this claim everywhere. We have no way of answering how many lives have allegedly been saved but we know for a fact that 170,000 women have given Irish addresses in the United Kingdom when having abortions. In addition, we now know that at least five people per day are having an abortion at home using an abortion pill. In this regard, let me read from a very recent academic study. It was, of course, conducted in Britain, not Ireland. The HSE should be producing this information. Carried out last year by Professor Sally Sheldon of the University of Kent, the study into the use of abortion pills North and South shows that 3,000 requests from Ireland, North and South, were sent to two websites alone: www.womenonweb.org and www.womenhelp.org. Let me break that down. Let us guess that 2,000 of the requests came from the Republic of Ireland. This amounts to 40 per week. Let us say that a number of the women did not go ahead with a termination because some people decide not to, as is their right - we are in favour of choice. That amounts to five per day. Therefore, the figures being cited by many people here may not be cited in full knowledge of the study to which I refer and should perhaps be much higher. The study covers only two websites; there are others. We have to face the reality that abortions are taking place. To say the amendment saves lives is obviously a joke. The WHO told the Oireachtas committee there is no difference in abortion rates, legal or illegal. The Netherlands, which has really no restriction whatsoever, has the lowest rate in the world. If the people to whom I refer were serious about lowering abortion rates, they would be backing campaigns for contraception and sex education, but their leaders vehemently oppose these. They need to be called out on that. We should stop calling them pro-life because women's lives matter as well. Whenever a woman dies or suffers, these people are wheeled out to deny the reality of why she has died, which is because of the eighth amendment. On the question of life, there is no magic moment when a life becomes a human being. What we do know, however, is that one must have more importance than the other. Some people are trying to make this referendum about something else. They are trying to make it about stigmatising the disabled, eugenics and most recently I even heard about abortion for sex selection. None of these are reasons why pregnant people in Ireland choose abortion. They are also trying to make it about late abortion, showing horrific pictures which I hope the referendum commission, which is being set up today, will challenge. These are about 1% of abortions and are carried out most usually for health reasons. In this referendum, we must make the case for the repeal of the eighth amendment and make a positive case for legislating afterwards for the reality of why people choose abortion, whether on Irish soil or abroad. I think that people will support that and show the same solidarity and respect for choices as they did in the marriage equality referendum. Hear our voices, respect our choices. If we have conversations in colleges, workplaces and schools, we will be able to persuade people that this change is necessary, that people do not make these decisions lightly and they are often difficult. The reasons why most Irish women choose abortion were listed in the report of the joint committee, the first being that the person could not cope with a child in their life at this time. That is an important reason and a valid reason for why someone should be allowed to make that decision, rather than it being made by the church or the State. That there was no support or money; age; education; health; rape; and fatal foetal abnormality were factors. I do not have the time here, but I exhort people to look at the cases published every day on the Facebook page, In Her Shoes, where people are coming out with their abortion stories, giving countless examples of why they have made that journey. Some 63% of Irish people who have had abortions have children already, which completely goes against the stereotype of the anti-abortion campaign. Most are aged between 30 to 34 years, the second largest group is 25 to 29 years. These are people who know what they are doing and we have to support them. The proposal for 12 weeks would cover 92% of the abortions that take place. We have abortion on demand in Ireland for those who are in the know and can afford it. There is abortion on demand through the Internet or through going abroad: there are no questions asked. Let us legislate for it. Does anyone seriously believe that young people and women will accept living in the twilight zone if this referendum is not carried? Look at Spain yesterday, where 5 million went on strike for women's rights. People North and South, in both States, want the right to control their own bodies. Let us recognise the rights of those people.";NULL

Do we want to move forward or do we want to stay in the dark ages, which I believe is best represented by the opinion of the Catholic bishops? I am not against Catholics or any religion, I would probably risk my life to defend anyone's right to practice the religion of their choice, but the religion of their choice is their business and their business alone. When the Catholic bishops preach that abortion is murder and that we must oppose it in all cases, even in cases of rape, incest and in heartbreaking situations where a woman is told that she is carrying a child that will not live, and they say it is still wrong, that is what we must move beyond. When I was in an abortion clinic in 1984, just after the referendum, I met a woman from Shankill. She was pregnant with her seventh child. She was poor and had struggled to get the money together to go to Liverpool for an abortion. She cried her eyes out to me before and after that abortion. I became her best friend in that clinic. The problem was not that she had to terminate the pregnancy of her seventh child, but that she had gone to confession before she went to Liverpool to tell the priest what she was about to do. He told her that she was committing a mortal sin and would go to hell. However, she had to make a decision for the other six children; would she live for them or would she die in pregnancy, because the doctor told her that she would not live through a seventh pregnancy. She made the decision to live for her six children and risk going to hell. I am delighted she made that decision and I comforted her by saying that I knew a firefighter who reared four boys, four very angry young men, who now live in this country. He reared them on his own, working through shifts and doing his best to rear the kids and guide them the right way, because his wife's doctor also told her that she could not carry through a fifth pregnancy or she would die. Her priest also told her that she would be committing a mortal sin if she terminated the pregnancy, and she made the opposite choice and she died. That man reared four angry boys, who missed the hell out of their mother, on his own. That is the sort of choice that we face in this country. We either move forward out of that dark, dark age or we stay in it. Worse still, it could get even darker because those who want to force women not to be able to make choices about their lives will be upbeat and confident in saying, for example, that they could arrest women for acquiring the abortion pill over the Internet. Maybe they could do what they did in the North of Ireland and arrest the mother of a young girl who procured an abortion pill for her. Let us think about the confidence that would grow on the side that wants to do us down, and do our gender and our rights down. Like Deputy Coppinger, I was on the streets last night with the people who were marching. It was so uplifting and it really does contrast the dark ages with the future. The vast majority of the people who were out marching last night for repeal were young men and women; young, passionate and determined. This is about their future. I am gone past my sell-by date, as are many people in this Dáil. We have to think about them. Those who want to stay in the dark ages also bear a responsibility. Please do not do this to other women in this country ever again. My fear is that if we do not stick together and make sure that we confidently get rid of the eighth amendment, we will push women back into a more severe position. If I was young again, I would not want to live in this country after 29 May, or whatever the date of the referendum, if the eighth amendment is still in the Constitution. I would be gone on the next plane or boat and would stay away because it augurs really badly for the future of this country. The future is about equality, it has to be. We saw how it was celebrated after the same-sex marriage referendum was won. Equality must also be about women. It was International Women's Day yesterday and right across the world women are rising up and saying they are not taking this crap. From the #MeToo campaign to the demand for gender pay equality, a revolution is happening where women are saying they will not tolerate being second-class citizens. That is what the eighth amendment does to women in this country, it puts us into a category that we do not have equality and we will never have equality so long as it remains. I want to say to those outside who support me on this, that when they go out knocking on doors during this campaign, they should be absolutely confident that they do so on an open door because we are talking to generations who have been through the dark ages. They will be talking to people who know about the bishops' cover-up on sex abuse scandals; only last week one of them, Bishop McAreavey in County Down, had to resign. Issues relating to the Magdalen laundries and sex abuse scandals are all baggage that we have in this country because we have a problem with sex and sexuality and with women's freedom and equality. We have to get over ourselves and move on. It is a huge challenge to us and one which the younger generation and the women in this country will stand up to and meet. We will go through a difficult day today and a difficult period in the coming weeks in the debates. I want to say to people in this House that it is not on to use this issue to play political games. We have to get serious. If Members are on different sides, stand up and say so but they should not absent themselves from the Dáil or try to demand quorums or get up on their feet to kick up a stink in an effort to filibuster and delay. Let us get on with the business of putting the referendum to the people and let them decide. This will be hugely historic. It is a challenging time for us. I appeal to the people out there in the movement to work hard to fight to win this referendum. It comes as only one opportunity in a lifetime to do so. It will affect the generations to come. I will shut up now because although I am going to use all of my time I have spoken on this issue so often - I will continue to do so - I wish to send a message to the women who feel regretful about their own past and the stuff that has happened to them. I will not open up a can of worms for a lot of women. They know themselves what it has been like. They should not be afraid of the church and they should not be afraid of what they are being told by priests. They have their own beliefs and they should be proud of their own beliefs, hold on to them and express them, but not be made to be fearful of them. In making the choice that suits them, women should hold their heads up high and know they are doing the right thing by themselves, by their families and by their partners. They are not committing a mortal sin, they will not go to hell and someday the State will recognise that and someday doctors, clinics and medical practitioners will be by their side, will have women's backs and will support them. I reiterate comments made by Deputy Ruth Coppinger and I repeat it as a sort of plea: those in the State who think that not having proper sex education and not having proper access to contraception is going to help to protect the unborn or sacred life are completely mistaken. We absolutely have to give non-Catholic and non-ethos based sex education to children and we have to make contraception free and safely available to women and men. If we do not do this all we do is create more opportunities and more definite situations where there will be more and more crisis pregnancies. If we want to end crisis pregnancies then we must open up the ancillary issues for complete accessibility for everybody. Many poorer people cannot afford to go to a doctor for contraception and cannot afford to buy the coil and so on. They need it available for free. We need to open up our services and our education so young people can have a healthy, well-rounded and well-informed attitude to their sexuality and their reproductive rights.";NULL
2316;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Mick Wallace;Independents 4 Change;"I support the Bill and I support the repeal of the eighth amendment. Should the referendum pass I will support the recommendations of the committee and, for the most part, the contents of the Government’s policy paper. The first step, however, is dealing with the eighth amendment and this needs to be differentiated from the legislation to follow should the referendum pass. I have spoken many times in the Chamber about the need to provide abortion as a health care service. Today I shall challenge some of the reasoning behind retaining the eighth amendment and I will then address the Government’s policy paper. First, I shall address the issue of adoption as a solution to a crisis pregnancy, as suggested by some Deputies. A considerable amount of time in the committee was spent on this issue. This is a misogynistic view that sees women as nothing more than vessels. It suggests that women should go through life-changing trauma if it will help out a childless couple who cannot have a baby of their own. This is forced birthing and it is being proposed in a State with a history of forced births and forced adoptions by religious orders. It is an absolutely terrifying and nightmarish scenario. How would this idea be implemented in practical terms? This concerns women with crisis pregnancies and some may even be suicidal. Are the Deputies planning to detain these women forcibly? How would the babies be handed over to these childless couples? Would the women then have to be declared unfit mothers or become wards of state? This is a deeply shocking and extreme view. Forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy against her will falls under the legal definition of torture, but have we not done this to women in Ireland for a long time? During statements on the committee recommendations I spoke about the committee’s 12 weeks without reason recommendation and how it is specifically intended to care for women who are pregnant as a result of rape. To some people the ""without reason"" clause may sound like a radical liberalising of our abortion laws. This is not the case and I say this as someone who favours much more liberal abortion laws. Personally, for example, I do not believe a woman must be raped before we should feel compassion for her. The clause is simply an attempt to provide compassionate, non-directive, non-judgmental care for victims of rape who have a crisis pregnancy. Yesterday the Minister said that most people in Ireland agree with providing terminations for victims of rape. If Members agree with this I urge them to support the Bill. Presumably Members will do so as it is very clear that repeal of the eighth amendment is necessary to accommodate victims of rape in terms of abortion legislation. I urge them also to support the committee’s recommendation, which is included in the Government’s policy paper, if the referendum is successful. The inclusion of a specific rape ground in legislation is neither a compassionate nor a workable means of supporting women in these circumstances, for two main reasons. First, it is simply not possible to prove through a medical examination that a rape has occurred. Second, the requirement to disclose what they have experienced in order to access abortion will likely re-traumatise and re-victimise such women. If a victim of rape must convince others that she deserves access to support, that person is disempowered all over again. This is the context for the without reason clause. I am aware that there are many Deputies and members of the public who do not believe that terminations for women who are the victims of rape should be permitted, that we should not change things or repeal the eighth amendment. Of course every rape is different, but I ask these people to imagine themselves in the shoes of such victims. Imagine the waves of nausea and vomiting, the feeling of complete and utter contamination, the pain of vaginal penetration, the pain of vaginal ruptures and torn skin, bleeding and infection, the pain of the restraining, the hitting, punching and choking and then imagine you are pregnant as a result. Now imagine you are 14 years old, the same age as the girl at the centre of the X case. Imagine the psychological trauma of carrying that child to birth: the real, physical weight of that child and the pain of childbirth. Think about this: a 14 year old girl who is pregnant as a result of rape and forced by the State to remain so. Imagine the practical reality of this. Does she continue to go to school? As she gets bigger and bigger, does she continue to wear her school uniform or is she granted an exemption? Does she tell her friends and all the people in her class that she was raped? How else does she explain the fact that she is pregnant? Does she tell her teachers? It is very, very difficult to hide the signs of pregnancy. Should she tell her neighbours and her cousins that she was raped? The context for this situation is a pervasive rape culture where sexual violence is trivialised and where victims are often blamed, so much so that most rapes are not even reported. Imagine this is your own 14 year old daughter and consider the practical, everyday reality of this. How would you explain this to her younger brother or sister? How would you feel sitting down to dinner every evening and looking at her as her body changes or in the morning when she has morning sickness as a result of rape? How on earth would you deal with this reminder every minute of every day of the extreme violation of your daughter? Maybe your daughter would be happy to carry this child to term and raise this child and maybe you would be happy with this and support her, but surely we should give her a choice in the matter. It is inhumane not to give her a choice. With regard to the Government’s policy paper, I am slightly concerned about the proposed time period between the request for a termination and the abortion pill being accessed. A cooling-off period like this in legislation may become another access barrier. I welcome the Minister’s comments today and recently on the importance of repealing the eighth amendment, but this proposal will look like the Government does not yet fully trust women and it risks replicating a damaging and patronising stereotype of women. The World Health Organization has said that waiting periods like this “demean women as decision makers”. France, Spain, Finland and Denmark do not have these time lapses. Waiting periods will only lead to delays in accessing treatment. If a woman decides to have an abortion, when she presents to a GP or elsewhere for treatment she will have already devoted a considerable amount of time and effort in making this decision. It is not a decision taken lightly. It is often, for a number of different reasons, a very emotional and distressing process. I believe that this proposed cooling off period sounds like a sop to placate those who seem to think women have abortions as a contraceptive measure without giving a second thought to it. One of the most upsetting and devastating aspects of this debate which some people seem to misunderstand is that women and couples who choose abortion often desperately want to have the child. Amanda Mellet desperately wanted her child. She was told the foetus had congenital defects meaning it would die in the womb or shortly after birth. Last year, the UN Human Rights Committee ruled that Ireland had subjected Amanda Mellet to ""discrimination and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment"" because of its laws against abortion. While I appreciate the Minister's thinking regarding informed consent, it is important we respect the decisions of these women. The first positive legislation to provide for abortion in Ireland was introduced just over six years ago in this Chamber by Deputy Clare Daly. We have been very slow to do the right thing. Let us help to make it happen at last.";NULL
2317;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Clare Daly;Independents 4 Change;"Obviously, I welcome the Bill and the fact that the Government is dealing with this issue comprehensively and expeditiously. This responsibility rests not just with the Minister and the Government, but with all of us in this House. For far too long the Irish people have waited to have a say on this. What we are doing is giving them a platform to decide precisely this matter for themselves. When we do this, we must put party and personal views behind ourselves and say this is a personal, private health care matter. The idea that it ever had a place in our Constitution is really frightening. I respect the fact that many of our citizens have very different views on this subject. They are entitled to those views and to have them respected, but the only way everyone's view can be respected is if we repeal the eighth amendment and allow people who feel they need to choose abortion that right. People who do not want to choose abortion, for religious or other reasons, already have that right respected, and I fully respect and stand over that. I find it strange in some ways how much the debate has moved on since those days six years ago when Deputy Wallace, Deputy Joan Collins and I introduced the Medical Treatment (Termination of Pregnancy in Case of Risk to Life of Pregnant Woman) Bill. At the time we were very apologetic that the only legislation we could put forward was to provide for abortion in circumstances in which a woman's life was in danger. However, even on this limited ground, the vote was 110 to 20 against. Not just the position reflected in the vote, but also the content of the discussion has moved on so much in the intervening time, and that says a lot. In some ways what it says is that everything is different but legislatively everything has remained the same. We need the eighth amendment repealed to be able to recognise properly Ireland's abortion reality. I also welcome the judgment of the Supreme Court this week. It is helpful. The fact that the court was clear in its ruling clears the way for us to recognise fully at last the rights of pregnant women, who, as I said, should never have been put in this position in the first place by the insertion of provisions concerning abortion into the Constitution. In saying this, it is important to say also that this does not mean the unborn has no rights, an argument that has started to be put forward already. That is not true. What the judgment says is that the unborn has no constitutional rights other than that outlined in the eighth amendment. How do all our peers across Europe and what we would call our compatriots in the advanced world treat the question of the unborn? They do not say foetal life has no value. No one says that. What is being clearly said is that foetal life does not have a value equal to that of the life and worth of a fully grown woman. Other societies have adopted measures whereby foetal life gets a certain amount of protection, particularly as the pregnancy develops, which can be reflected in legislation, but it is not the same as for a fully grown woman, a woman who may have other children, a husband or a partner - or not, as the case may be. It is important to say this. In the six years since we introduced our Bill, there have been consequences of the inaction of this House. Some 6,500 Irish women have ordered abortion pills online without being able to get appropriate assistant treatment from their doctors. It is a relatively safe pill but still, they should not have had to make that decision because of our inaction. It should not have been the case that almost 20,000 women were forced out of our health care system to access safe abortion in the UK in the six years since we discussed this. The barriers to legal and safe abortion have exposed these women to added harm. I will not go over the cases to which other Deputies have referred: Savita Halappanavar; Ms Y, who came here seeking asylum and had her rights violated again by effectively a forced pregnancy following rape; the case of Amanda Mellet, which has been highlighted already; and the families who have received a diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormality and who so bravely championed their cases to the European Court of Human Rights. We owe them a debt of gratitude. We have had many chances to deal with this before now. Members of this House have said Irish society was not ready but actually, it was the politicians who were not ready. Irish society has long been ready to deal with this issue. What we have seen in recent years is an awakening of the silent majority, the people who did not go out on the streets but who believe this is a private, personal matter and who want to respect the views of all people but do not want to go out and lobby on the matter. These people are now making themselves known more. As I said, it was the politicians who were not ready. I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken the helm on this. That is appropriate. All Members who say they are in favour of repeal have a responsibility to go out and campaign for it. Why would they not? To say one wants to protect women's health, lives and choices is something to be very proud of and I think the Irish people are capable of understanding that message. The Citizens' Assembly played a great role and the joint committee was a really useful exercise. If anyone has concerns or doubts about this issue, they should take the time to read what has been published online by both the committee and the Citizens' Assembly. What was dealt with in these fora was strong, factual, evidence-based information from medical and legal experts, as well as women who have the direct experience. This is what should mould this discussion. It is not a question of whether one agrees or disagrees with abortion or whether one is pro or anti-abortion. Abortion exists and happens and will not stop happening. It did not stop happening in the six years during which we did not deal with it and it will not stop happening in the future. The idea that the floodgates will open if we bring this measure in is just not scientific, evidence-based or factually correct. We do not know how reliable the Irish figures that are quoted are because many people do not give Irish addresses when they travel and so on. Therefore, to say our abortion rates are lower is not scientific. Outlawing abortion does not mean there is no abortion. The choice is not between abortion and no abortion; it is between safe and unsafe abortion. Deputy Wallace and I were in Malawi last week visiting a refugee camp. Because we have an interest in prison issues, we also took time out to visit some prisons there. We visited the women's prison in Lilongwe, the capital. Most of the women in prison in Malawi are either there for infanticide or, because abortion is outlawed there, may have miscarried and have been convicted on the basis of induced abortion. Looking back on Ireland's history, one can see there were high levels of infanticide. Women should always have the right to have children when they want and when they feel they are capable of parenthood, and we should support that. Our shortcomings as a State in allowing backward attitudes to sexuality absolutely must change. I imagine most citizens want to keep abortion numbers down. I certainly do. I do not want anyone to have any medical procedure he or she does not need. However, if one really wants to reduce the number of abortions, all the evidence shows that the way to do so is not through restrictive legislation but through comprehensive sex education and widely available contraception. These are the ways to reduce abortion rates and it is what we need to do. We need safe abortion through our health service, not someone else's health service. It would be remiss if we did not mention the debt of gratitude we actually owe to medical practitioners in the UK in particular, who have provided safe abortion for 170,000 Irish women since 1983. I really hope the future of the country will not be reliant on other people's health services. We need to raise the standard of health care for women at home. I agree with Deputy Wallace that some of the measures in the legislation need to be changed, but generally it is heading in the right direction. If we bring this in it will mean earlier and safer abortions without the risks and cost entailed in travelling and without the stigma of criminality, and the facts indicate this will have a positive impact on women's health. I do not have time to develop other points, but last week the EU Commissioner for human rights made an excellent speech in the European Parliament. He warned about the danger of backtracking on women's rights and warned about complacency. He made the point that gender equality has not been achieved in any EU country and it will take vast cultural and economic changes to get anywhere near this. Some of us are further behind than others and we have to stop paying lip service to women's equality. This means fair pay for fair work, protecting women's rights in the workplace, affordable child care and access to full reproductive rights. In his remarks, the Commissioner addressed the issue on a European basis, stating restrictive laws should be brought into line with international human rights standards and best practice. Best practice is achieved by ensuring abortion is legal and on a woman's request, and that it takes place in early pregnancy and thereafter is made available throughout pregnancy to protect her life, her health and her freedom from ill-treatment. This is what we should strive for. Any practical and financial barriers, along with criminal penalties, need to be removed. It is a human rights issue and a health issue and it is something we as a society should begin to embrace because it is incredibly positive if women and their partners, if they have one, are having children when they want and when they have the means and wherewithal of supporting those children.";NULL
2318;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Mattie McGrath;Independent;"I am pleased to be able to speak on the Bill. I have many concerns about its very rushed nature, which I will address in my remarks. The manner in which the Government has dealt with this referendum Bill has been nothing short of disgraceful. No rationale has been offered as to why the entire process has had to lead to a mad rush towards 25 May as the date of the proposed referendum that will strip unborn children of all constitutional protection if the eighth amendment is removed. How tragically ironic that 25 May is national missing children's day in the United States, whose abortion regime we are set to follow in so many ways. Recently, the Taoiseach used the phrase ""safe, legal and rare"" which he copied from Hillary Clinton. Is 50 million safe, legal or rare? If it is, they are badly mixed up. We will follow in so many ways and I will say more on this later. We now know the decision of the Supreme Court to reject the High Court finding that the unborn child enjoyed significant constitutional protections beyond the eighth amendment was an historic lost opportunity. The decision of the Supreme Court was profoundly disturbing to me and many others. It has demonstrated with absolute clarity the eighth amendment is now the only defence the unborn child has against arbitrary decisions of a future Oireachtas and politicians on the extent and grounds upon which abortion may be obtained, and we know this. We also know if the eighth amendment is removed, Bills will be introduced here the week after to extend the time in terms of the gestation period. In light of this, the stakes could not be higher in terms of the need to retain Article 40.3.3°. Despite the unanimous decision of the eminent justices, there was actually no true justice contained in the court's judgment. It has effectively put at zero the reality of the unborn child as a living breathing member of the human family that is uniquely vulnerable and open to attack. While I do not believe the eighth amendment will be repealed, regardless of today's decision, I do think that if the Government's hostile, manipulative and aggressively pro-choice agenda is successfully perpetrated upon the people, then the court's decision may be seen as the Irish equivalent of Roe v. Wade all that time ago in the United States. That historic decision of the US Supreme Court essentially shot down possible constitutional protections and handed over to US state politicians the power of life and death over the unborn child. I mentioned the more than 50 million babies lost since that judgment. The questions we must ask ourselves now is do we really want to hand such power over to our political leaders and can we live with the consequences if we do. These are very important questions that will be put to the people. I want to raise the recent findings of the very respected poll published this week of our GPs, in respect of the provision of abortion services. The poll of general practitioners found that two thirds of those asked stated they will refuse to comply with Government proposals to designate them as lead providers for abortion services. Is mór an trua é go bhfuil an tAire imithe. The Minister has left. He announced in the previous debate that GPs would be summarily instructed to be front-line deliverers of the abortion service even though he had not asked them or consulted. This is the answer. The Irish Independent reported that nearly seven in ten of the 497 GPs who voted in a closed doctors' forum stated they would not be involved in medical abortions. This was a closed forum and it was not just anyone that was phoned up or completed it online as in other polls. This is 70%, which is pretty concerning, and if the Government does not want to listen to that who will it listen to? It did not listen when it forced free GP care for those aged under six. We see the bedlam this has caused. By any fair standard, this ought to be a devastating and potentially fatal blow to a central feature of the Government's plan on how it wants to roll out unrestricted abortion access up to 12 weeks. It also demonstrates the absurdity of the claims that were made by the Chairperson of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that it could not find a single GP opposed to the repeal of Article 40.3.3°. It could not find one, but 70% of them have come out clearly. They were not asked, sought, allowed or wanted.";NULL

2321;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Mattie McGrath;Independent;"If the Minister decides to proceed with the plan to introduce legislation, it will be a case of him doing so while knowing with clear certainty that it will be practically impossible to implement, given the scale of opposition to it by GPs. I am sure they do not do this lightly. They do so with the best of consciences. They have a Hippocratic oath to look after people and mind them, so this is a considered opinion. This is a big blow and very startling. It is a crippling blow and an embarrassment for the Minister, Deputy Harris, and all those whose only intent is to foist an unrestricted abortion regime upon our people. Serious consideration must now be given to scrapping the proposal in light of the inherent unworkability of the proposals that has been clearly exposed. I will now go back to the indecent haste. The Business Committee met only yesterday at 2.30 p.m. Many Deputies had gone home. We did not have a Bill. We did not have the so-called explanatory memorandum. We did not have an explanation from the Minister and his officials. We did not have anything. We did not have it this morning when he came into speak. Bhí deich nóiméad imithe before we got the speech. This is the indecent haste. We got the Bill online at 10.15 a.m., and several hours later we were expected to deal with this legislation on such a serious issue. If we do not have doctors offering it, serious consideration must be given to scrapping the proposal in light of its inherent unworkability, which has been clearly exposed. The only other option is the likes of private, profit driven UK and US abortion providers, with appalling health records, to set up shop here. Has anyone considered this appalling vista? They should have the guts to say so. The Minister of State must now answer. How will it be delivered if the GPs have flatly refused? We know these people are only too willing. They are keen to come to this country, because theirs is a murky, dirty, money-driven business. We have seen that worldwide. We know they will do that if they ever get to operate here. That is exactly what they have done for years in the UK and tried to do in Northern Ireland. Ms Liz McDermott from the group One Day More, one of the two witnesses before the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution promoting pro-life values, said to the committee: The provision of abortion is increasingly being questioned in other countries as people see where legalisation leads. Alternatives to abortion and support for women with difficult or unplanned pregnancies are also offered in these countries. However, because they do not have anything like the eighth amendment in place and abortion is widely lawful, they face obstacles and difficulties carrying out their work. [That much has been proven.] Organisations which do life sustaining work are stymied and prevented from reaching out to women in a supportive way to give them the opportunity - not a choice - to keep their baby. When people came from different parts of the world to speak to us, hotels were bullied out of offering a venue for their public meetings. These speakers included victims of rape, women who were conceived in rape and others. Thankfully we found a hotel in Cork, Deputy Kelleher's county, that took them. We held a very productive meeting of 500 people, who shared stories that were telling. However, the Oireachtas committee did not want to hear them, nor did the Citizens' Assembly. Above all, did the Minister of State or anyone in the Government want to meet them? No. Ms. McDermott went on to tell us ""We can see from other countries that abortion is a large and profitable global industry."" It is interesting to see the same politicians who rail against global industries every day supporting this one wholeheartedly. It is an interesting analogy as far as I am concerned. Every day of the week they rail against our own global giants and the global giants that come here from abroad. Yet on this issue, we are buying into one, hook, line and sinker. We are delighted. We welcome them with open arms. We are saying to them ""tar isteach agus beidh an-airgead againn, come quick, brostaígí"". The legislation is in a terrible hurry. Cén fáth? I would like the Minister to freagair an cheist sin, má tá sé ábalta. He should note that is nothing to smirk or be giddy about. It is a serious issue as far as I am concerned, though maybe for him it is not. Abortion is a huge and purely money-centred industry. Ms McDermott went on to say: Its practice, standards and methods are not always women centred, as is claimed, but may be more about profit. Just last month, the Care Quality Commission in Britain issued a damning report on the abortion provider, Marie Stopes. It revealed that staff were being paid bonuses to encourage women to go through with abortions. [I stress that this was an independent inquiry.] The inspectors found evidence of a policy in all 70 Marie Stopes clinics in the country directing staff to contact women who had decided not to go through with an abortion, offering them a new appointment. Bonuses were offered to staff. These women were being traumatised. Many of them had decided not to have their abortion because of the eighth amendment or for other reasons. Perhaps compassionate people spoke to them. These women were being lobbied, as if the providers were salesmen selling car or hoovers to householders. It is despicable, and it is before our eyes. We know it. If the media would only be honest and fair it would print the news. In the words of Ms McDermott: This is tantamount to placing pressure on women to opt for abortion and is rightly causing people to rethink their support for abortion and look at alternatives which genuinely care for women and babies. This is just one of several recent scandals involving the abortion industry in England and elsewhere. Is this the kind of abortion regime we want here? It looks increasingly obvious that this is what we will get if the opposition of the GPs is anything to go by. Those opposed to abortion are not all religious fanatics. I have teams out in Tipperary with whom I go out canvassing every night of the week. They are of all religions and none. Some are agnostics and some are non-believers. They believe in and value life. In his rush to bring the Bill forward, the Minister said that we must have an open and respectful debate. He referred to Ms Savita Halappanavar, as did several other speakers who spoke before me. Will they not allow her to rest in peace? Three independent reports adjudicated that her death arose from a misdiagnosis and bad practice. Unfortunately, there are countless deaths from sepsis in our health service, even this year. There are greater numbers in the NHS in England and all over the word. For this woman's grave to pounced on gach lá in aon áit chun an scéal sin a rá is uafásach ar fad. I really am saddened by it. All the Deputies want a respectful debate. Ms Halappanavar's husband appeared on radio with Ms Marian Finucane five weeks after the incident. We sympathise 100% with the loss of his wife and the mother of his expected baby. He was asked whether he wanted abortion introduced into Ireland. D'fhreagar sé an ceist by saying that he did not. This was on live radio. The recording has not been played since. I am demanding that RTÉ produces that replay. It was never accessible on the RTÉ player. It was removed. RTÉ is supposed to be responsible and fair, and our taxes fund it. The presenter then asked Mr. Halappanavar if he want his wife's situation to be used. He asked for it not to be used and misused. I heard Ms Halappanavar's mother being used in this way. People should respect his rights and not pounce on the grave. People can see what is going on. What are we going to do? The Minister has made so many promises. A letter was given to me by several people in County Wicklow, the Minister's constituency. In the election campaign he promised that he was pro-life and would do everything he could to save lives. He is running and hiding from those constituents now. This promise was signed by him and sent out to thousands of voters at the time. He will have to freagar that ceist in áit eile. Then we come onto Deputy Kelleher, who said that pro-life people do not trust the Oireachtas of the future. He conflated that with a claim that we do not trust women. This has nothing to do with that. The people have proved that they do not trust politicians. It was proved when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said he got a wallop or a kick from the public when he asked them to get rid of the Seanad. We need that Chamber because legislation is rushed through here and this Bill is evidence of that. This legislation is being made with indecent haste. It panders to certain groups that want a vote on 25 May at all costs. The optimum time to have a vote, if we want to have one, is September. Then all the students are back in college, all the kids are back in school and the vast majority of parents and guardians are insan tír anseo, they are back home from their laethanta saoire. The mad rush will catch its proponents napping. How dare Deputy Kelleher say that? We are not saying that we do not trust women. I met 30 women at a meeting last night. I refer to young women and mothers who go out canvassing. We must not conflate this issue with mistrust of women. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan appealed for respect, careful perusal and compassion. She then went on to say talk about Savita again. Downright untruths and being peddled every day of the week in the House when the facts are there. We can access the evidence of the tragic loss of life that happened so unfortunately. In my county, I recently attended the funeral of a man in his 40s who died from sepsis. There are dozens of them in this country, more this year than ever, with the serious incidences of flu that took place. The story of Ms Halappanavar is used all the time. Deputy Adams spoke about respect and respectful debate. That tells its own story. I will return to the subject of the Citizens' Assembly, the very genesis of this. The night I met the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, before he formed the Government, I asked him about the eighth amendment, because he knew where I stood. He assured me there would not be any problem. He said there would be a Citizens' Assembly, followed by an Oireachtas committee and then a free vote, and everything would be hunky-dory. It is not hunky-dory. The Citizens' Assembly was caught napping only last week, when replacements had to be sought. I wonder why they had to get so many replacements? I compliment people who give their time to serve on the Citizens' Assembly. However, the real citizens' assembly is an áit seo - Teach Laighean. That is the citizens' assembly to which we were elected. I am privileged and honoured have been elected to represent Tipperary. We all have that privilege. This is the citizens' assembly; not that carry-on that cost €2 million. We do not have money to pay for people's orthodontic treatment and we are bussing patients to Belfast to get their cataracts done. Deputies Michael Collins and Danny Healy-Rae and I have all experienced this. However, we have money to throw away on this. As for the RED C poll, I do not trust any polling company to be honest. I never hired one in my life or engaged one. I can say that with impunity. The company was caught when it wanted to replace people but we knew the whole time that there was a malfunction, a set-up and a stitch-up there because 11 counties, including my own, were left out of the Citizens' Assembly. RED C has further acknowledged this in its own report. Thousands of people have written to the Government looking for an independent report on what went on. It was a stitch-up and, as I said before, the stitches are briste. The geansaí or gúna has fallen apart and is in a heap of brus. That is what happened. RED C has acknowledged that it would need at least 400 or 500 people to have any kind of representative example of the voting population of our Twenty-six Counties. It has admitted that, yet Ms Justice Laffoy is happy to say that everything is okay. I refer to when replacements were being looked for and I want to ask a ceist. Cad a tharla do na teachtaí in the assembly? Why did those people all leave after the first part of it, or after the piece dealing with the eighth amendment? The assembly had other work to do as well. We then saw the flagrant abuse that went on to select new people, involving selecting family and friends. It was a set-up, a stitch-up and a codology. Someone else last night used the word ""codology"" instead of ""theology"". There is much codology here, but the people - tá siad ag fanacht. They are waiting in their houses and are ready to come out here. They did not trust the Government or the politicians - tá Deputy Kelleher imithe - when they refused to give more powers to the Oireachtas. They said ""No"" then as well. They did not trust the politicians when they wanted to get rid of the Seanad. We have a wise, intelligent and educated electorate, thankfully. I want every person to be able to be in the country to vote. People say I do not want them to cast their vote. I am a democrat to my very foundations. It is only fair and it is respectful that people vote. It is not like the sham of the Citizens' Assembly, a con job. A polling company that was friendly to the Government got the job. This is what happened. The Government has been found out and caught napping. As I said, there is much untruth here. It sticks in my throat to hear Members talking about the late, poor, unfortunate Savita Halappanavar when her family has asked that she not be used in this issue. I ask representatives about tomorrow too. Tens of thousands of people will be walking in Dublin tomorrow. I would ask some of the parties of the left, especially, to refrain from the indignation and the disgraceful spitting on, and attacking of, people who want to express their democratic right to march in Dublin tomorrow.

2323;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Catherine Murphy;Social Democrats;I am sharing time with Deputies Ryan and Healy. I acknowledge that this is a historic day. Far from it happening with undue haste, it has in fact been through a lengthy process, including the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party committee. While Deputy McGrath is entitled to his opinion, I do not believe that he would ever see this as having a right time. I come to this debate as somebody who was a member of the all-party Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. That had three months of intensive hearings where what we heard were actual facts, not rhetoric or personal beliefs, but actual facts writ large. Those facts were indisputable. There was medical expertise from across the Irish health care system and, indeed, the international medical community was ad idem. The eighth amendment endangers women, it ties the hands of medics and, ultimately, it puts lives in danger. It was unequivocal. It was no accident that the committee struggled to source medical experts who would take the view that the eighth amendment was a good thing. The reality is that the vast majority of maternal professionals want and need the eighth amendment to be repealed. I am generally happy with the wording and with the general scheme as has been outlined by the Minister. I commend the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, for his work on this issue. It was not my experience on the committee that formed my position. In 1983, I strongly opposed the insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution, believing that the Constitution is not and never should be the place to deal with a health care issue. Since 1983, we have had to watch as countless women and families have been traumatised and victimised by the application of the eighth amendment. We have been through the alphabet soup of women who have suffered and some who have died. They are just the high-profile cases. That does not necessarily capture the hundreds of thousands of women and medics, some who faced fairly dicey decisions that could have gone either way. We know the eighth amendment gives an equal right to life to the unborn and the mother. Where there is a risk to health, we heard medics ask us whether they would intervene when it is a 20% risk, a 50% risk, or if they waited until it was an 80% or 90% risk. What parent would want that for a daughter or a sibling for a sister? What child would want his or her mother to be put in that kind of peril? That is exactly what is happening. That is what the eighth amendment means. The big thing that stood out for me at recent committee hearings and the surrounding debate was the issue of health care and specifically people's right to equal health care. Anyone who has had the misfortune to require a medical procedure will be familiar with the consent form a person or one's next of kin is asked to fill in. That does not happen when one is pregnant. There is no consent when one is pregnant. The eighth amendment precludes consent when one is pregnant. That is a very significant constraint on the medical profession. Put simply, there is no equality of health care in Ireland because of the eighth amendment.  Thankfully, Ireland has changed. It is a changed place since 1983. People realise that life is not black and white. There is a whole sequence of shades of grey which we have seen played out over the decades. We have come on in leaps and bounds with regard to our cultural attitudes, yet the existence of the eighth amendment has ensured that the way in which we treat pregnant women has not progressed at all. There are barbaric cases such as that of the woman whose dead body was essentially used as an incubator while her family had to fight through the courts for the life support to be switched off. Her body was decomposing. People asked what kind of country we are when they saw that scenario. We are a compassionate people. That compassion will and does extend to maternal care. We need to trust our very well-regulated legal profession. Ultimately, we need to trust women and to repeal the eighth amendment. This is a people's referendum. One can make changes to the Constitution that are often quite technical, about timelines for how long a Parliament might sit or whatever. This is a people's referendum and we are seeing evidence of people engaging. I am seeing it in my constituency. I have been engaging with it and have done some canvassing as well. I will be voting for repeal and I will encourage others to do so too. I urge people to get active, to have conversations about the topic and to put compassion to the forefront of everything that they do over the next weeks and months as we hopefully get closer to providing equality of health care for women in Ireland. The committee was very clear about the ancillary recommendations, that they were not ancillary but were central to the kind of health care system that we required. Comprehensive and non-religious-based sex education is required. Contraception must be freely available. This is what one does. Education and the provision of contraceptives are the kind of things that will reduce the numbers. They are not ancillary recommendations nor are the recommendations that there has to be equality of maternal care. In terms of things such as anomaly scans, it should not matter if one lives in a part of the country that is a significant distance from a teaching hospital. There must be equality for women in the health care system. The committee very strongly wished to have such equality but that will not necessarily find its way into legislation. Resources will be key in that regard. Resources must be provided in a way that respects that this is not just about repealing the eighth amendment but, rather, a much wider range of things that need to be done. The key issue is that we must repeal the eighth amendment. I will be out canvassing and campaigning to ensure that my party and I play our part in trying to achieve that.;NULL
2324;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Eamon Ryan;Green Party;The Green Party will be supporting the campaign for the repeal of the eighth amendment to the Constitution. The provisions set out by the Government following receipt of the advice of the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee very closely mirror our party position in many ways and we will be supporting the Government in that regard. Some in our party have a different view and may campaign on the other side of the referendum, as they are fully entitled to do, and they will be respected in so doing. Ultimately, the people are sovereign when it comes to decisions on the Constitution. The Oireachtas can help to guide the debate and referendum but it does not own or control them. It has done a good job in framing the debate in recent months through mechanisms such as the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee, while the broad outline of the legislation that is being presented and the wording that is proposed to replace the eighth amendment are of further assistance in that regard. In my contribution during the consideration of the report of the joint committee by the House, I articulated my concern that any provision relating to this matter would be inserted into the Constitution. My sense was that the original attempt to deal with the issue and, as Deputy Clare Daly stated, provide an equality of rights between the rights of the foetus and those of the mother in a constitutional way was a mistake and never going to work. I was concerned by the proposal for a further provision to the Constitution and believed it unnecessary. Most European and other similar countries have no constitutional provision on this issue. On first reading, the wording that has been presented by the Government seems to be reasonably clear and simple, does not unnecessarily constrain the Oireachtas and perhaps provides legal protection that the Attorney General thought necessary in order that the legislation that will be considered would not be challenged. The broad approach and outline of the provision makes sense. I was pleased that much attention was given in the Minister's speech to the issue of improving the care we provide to mothers who are making decisions on pregnancy and that he will come back to the House with detailed provisions in that regard. One of the opportunities we have in what I hope will be a moment of change is that not alone will we not be forcing women to travel by boat or plane without any contact or take pills ordered from the Internet without medical assistance but also that we will ensure that the choices made by women are full, free and unencumbered by State-introduced mechanisms which would steer those always difficult decisions. It is very welcome that the Minister discussed ensuring that we proceed with our national maternity policy and further resource maternity services. However, we must go beyond that. We must signal a change in Government policy, much of which is antithetical to women, such as our tax and pension systems and a range of other mechanisms which make it more difficult for women, in particular those who are on their own in terms of raising a child. Change on that scale is needed. If the people vote for us to change how we approach this issue, it will be vital to have a detailed understanding of and statistics and data on the decisions that are being made and the circumstances within which they are being made. That is not intended to in any way impinge on the privacy of or try to influence those making such decisions but, rather, to help us understand why we, like so many other countries, have so many unwanted or emergency pregnancies and to assess what we can do to ease the circumstances that lead to such situations. As all Members have said, no one wants to put anyone into a position of having to choose. As all Members know, the timeframe for the referendum is short because of the need to await the judgement delivered yesterday by the Supreme Court. It would be appropriate to hold the referendum before the end of May. I am uncertain of the meaning of a provision in the Minister's well-articulated speech, which I read with interest. It refers to terminations that take place after the first trimester period in which it has been recommended that an indication is unnecessary. In terms of later terminations, the Minister stated that it is important to be clear and truthful that, in cases where the foetus is viable, early delivery and the full range of neonatal care are the reality. I do not understand what that means and I ask the Minister to clarify it. I am sure that clarity will be brought to such issues during the debate that we will have in the coming weeks, which is the purpose and the valid role of such debate in this referendum. There is a role for the Medical Council in terms of medical ethics because, as well as two doctors assessing the inevitably complicated and hugely different individual cases, our policy indicates that the Medical Council must contribute to providing an ethical structure for such decisions. The details of how that works can be addressed in the legislation and need not be dealt with now. We must agree upon the broad principles, the heads of a Bill, the issues set out by the Minister and the statements which will give guidance to the people as they make their decisions in this referendum. Even though such situations are very rare, we want them to be safe, legal and rare, and the role of the Medical Council in terms of ethics and the structures in place in such circumstances must be teased out. As Deputy Catherine Murphy stated, this is an historic day. It will be seen by some as a turn in the wrong direction but, for me, it is a step in the right direction and in tune with the women who have had to make difficult decisions or take difficult journeys. Such women will now have to make less of a journey because we will deal with this in our own country. As we have recognised over the years, the mother has the right to make this choice. That has already been decided. Today, we are deciding how we step with her in that process. It is a welcome move away from saying goodbye to women at passport control and towards their not having to travel because we will deal with these issues at home.;NULL
2325;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Seamus Healy;Independent;In the short time available to me, I wish to welcome the Bill, which provides for a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, and confirm my support for it. I will be supporting repeal in the referendum. It is 35 years since Article 40.3.3° was enshrined in the Constitution. In 1983, I publicly opposed and voted against that amendment. I did so because I believed then, as I do now, that it would have a seriously detrimental effect on the well-being, health and lives of women and that it would give rise to widespread uncertainty and confusion in terms of legal and medical matters. Sadly, that is what happened. There have since been numerous referendums on the issue, Irish and European court cases and the deaths of women. We must remember cases such as those of Ms X, Ms Y and Ms P and the A, B, C and D cases. Some 35 years on, it is now a democratic imperative that the public be given an opportunity to decide this issue. A new generation of Irish women and men must be allowed to have their say on the eighth amendment as they are the ones it will affect on a very personal basis. We, as legislators, have a responsibility and a duty to give the people of Ireland a voice and a vote on this issue. Irish abortion exists. It is a reality. It takes place in other jurisdictions, for the most part, for those who can afford it and by way, more recently, of the abortion pill here at home. In 2016, 3,265 Irish women and girls travelled to the UK alone. However, many more travelled to other jurisdictions as well. From my own constituency of Tipperary, 69 women travelled. About 170,000 Irish women and girls have travelled to other countries for abortions since 1980. The abortion pill is of course the new reality in Ireland, with about 1,500 being taken per year. Abortion must be dealt with urgently, and, I believe, in a compassionate and an understanding way. We cannot continue a situation where women's lives are at risk and the medical profession is unclear about the legal position. We must protect the health and safety of Irish women. I am satisfied this requires the repeal of the eighth amendment and the implementation of legislation enshrining the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. In short, we must trust Irish women. I acknowledge this is a difficult, sensitive and emotive issue for many people. The reasons are not hard to understand. Intense ethical, religious, social, political and intimate personal issues coincide. However, I believe there is a significant middle ground and a majority of the public is in favour of repealing the eight amendment and in favour of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. In this country, debate around termination has been characterised by polarising arguments and a lack of respect for opposing views. I respect and understand those opposing views. I welcome the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution generally and also in relation to the issues of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality. I specifically welcome the joint committee's recommendation 2.11: The Committee is of the view that no differentiation should be made between the life and the health of the woman. This is consistent with the evidence from medical experts made available to the Committee regarding the difficulty medical professionals have in defining where a threat to health becomes a threat to life. I welcome and support the Bill and hope there will be a constructive and respectful debate on this issue in the coming months.;NULL
2326;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Kate O'Connell;Fine Gael;"Last week in this country we experienced an act of God. I refer to Storm Emma. We had four days of bitter ice, cold and snow. Who did that weather and that act of God leave out in the cold, both figuratively and literally? Women again, as it is always. Between 36 and 48 women either had to cancel expensive flights, hotel rooms and appointments in the UK or reschedule them because of an act of God. A further 12 to 15 women were waiting by the door to get illegal pills, probably fretting about whether the postman would be able to battle the elements and deliver them. Of those women sitting in the waiting rooms of England now, many will have been tipped across the safe threshold for taking tablets through no fault of their own but due to an act of God. I refer to weather and factors beyond their control. How do we in this House feel about that? Today, I pay tribute to the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, for the leadership, compassion, maturity and understanding he has shown in regard to the eighth amendment. I also thank Deputy Kelleher for his considered contribution to the Chamber this morning. I was struck last night by a tweet I read from a woman called Aoife. She stated that it was honestly no wonder that one of Ireland's mythological creatures is a woman shrieking in endless rage and sorrow. It brought me back to childhood and tales of banshees in primary school. I thought about Pádraig Pearse's poem Mise Éire: Mise éire: Sine mé ná an Chailleach Bhéarra Mór mo ghlóir: Mé a rug Cú Chulainn cróga. Mór mo náir: Mo chlann féin a dhíol a máthair. Ireland has always been painted as female, as our mother, our homeland and the cradle in which we were reared and nurtured. I refer to Ireland and the suffering and labour of a gender personified and immortalised in art and literature as confined into the shape and borders of a country. I refer to Irish women confined and contained within that country. In respect of the utter hypocrisy of the thirteenth amendment, why did we need it? Why did we need to enshrine the right to travel? Travel for what? Travel with what intent and to what end? I asked a witness who favoured retaining the eighth amendment at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution if he would support repealing the thirteenth amendment. He bluntly replied with one word: ""No"". This man, who commands huge respect among people who want to keep the eighth amendment, said on the record that he does not want to repeal the right to travel. The people to whom he is aligned and supports must therefore want the status quo to remain. I refer to the people who claim to love both. Those people who state falsehoods about foetal development and try to bamboozle people with billboards and posters of computer-generated impressions of what the unborn human might look like. Now, that witness was not an expert on gynaecology, although he is an eminent legal mind who campaigned fiercely for the eighth amendment to be introduced in 1983. Then we asked Dr. Peter Boylan, when he appeared before the joint committee, a reasonable question. Will there be far more abortions if we repeal the eighth amendment? Dr. Boylan, the former master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, who himself has delivered more than 6,000 babies and is one of Ireland's respected consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists, said it was documented that in countries where abortion is banned the rate of women dying remains high. He said approximately 70,000 women die each year from complications relating to unsafe abortions. The joint committee heard testimony from Professor Abigail Aiken that Irish women today are attempting self-abortions with potentially fatal consequences. It is equally well documented, she said, that countries with liberal laws and easy access to contraception have lower rates of abortion than those with restrictive laws. Women in Ireland with financial resources have access to termination of pregnancy, primarily in the UK. However, women who are poor, in the care of the State or women who are refugees do not have such access. The thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution are of no assistance to these poor women and refugees. Without access to abortion in the UK, it is inevitable that Ireland would have an epidemic of illegal abortions and a massive increase in maternal mortality, resulting in dead women. If Ireland were to enact legislation in line with the EU consensus, including termination without restriction up to ten weeks, our law would be among the most conservative in Europe. However, it would deal with the vast majority of circumstances in which women currently access services outside the State. The forthcoming referendum on the eighth amendment should put a simple binary question, the experts said, to the electorate. I refer to being for or against repeal. Legislation is the responsibility of the Oireachtas not the people. On repeal of the eighth amendment, Irish law on termination of pregnancy would continue to be governed by the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act. There would be no legislative vacuum pending further legislation. In the meantime, women in Ireland will continue to access services in the UK or elsewhere in Europe or to access abortion pills illegally, as they are doing today. All of the international evidence is that in countries where there is a liberal law or where they change from a restrictive to a more liberal law, the rate of termination falls. This must be tied in, however, with improved health, contraception and sexual health education and cannot be looked at in isolation. That is what the experts said and that is what really shook so many of us in the Oireachtas committee. We at the committee had been hearing anecdotal suggestions that floodgates would open, that Irish abortion rates would rocket, that women would go wild altogether with abandon and would use abortion as contraception but experts at the coal face of our health service dispelled all of those myths. How could we be sure though? We asked the eminent head of obstetrics and gynaecology in St. George's Hospital, Tooting in London, who also happens to be president of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, who said that the experience in France, Italy and Turkey is that once termination of pregnancy is legalised, the abortion rate comes down. The main reason for that is that it is combined, as Dr. Boylan mentioned, with good post-abortion contraception. It is a very clear distinction that it comes down without any difficulty. Second, because medical termination of pregnancy is available, things are getting safer. The WHO document shows that the chance of a mother dying during a termination in the first trimester is 0.1 per 100,000, which is minimal. As the gestation period increases, so too do the complications and risks. Illegal abortion comes to the fore when women are in the later period of gestation and run into difficulties. Legalisation of abortion brings the termination rates down. That is the experience, not just in one country, but in a number of countries including South Africa. Is that not interesting? People are being told that repealing the eighth amendment will have a catastrophic effect on women's health. That is simply not true and not repealing it is far more dangerous. People are being told that repealing the eighth amendment will lead to more Irish women having abortions but all the evidence would suggest that this is not true either. The Oireachtas committee asked Ms Leah Hoctor, the regional director for Europe of the Center for Reproductive Rights to outline the norms in a European context, including whether the countries that introduced a 12-week gestational limit increased that later. I thank Deputy Billy Kelleher for reading into the record of the House this morning the details of term limits in a European context. Ms Hoctor said: [I]t is my understanding the limit was decided in the law reform process and I do not believe we have seen change in a European country. A country that has set a ten or 12-week limit on request or a later limit has not shifted. Other requirements and facets of the law have changed and developed over time. The most common limit is 12 weeks. Although these countries' laws were adopted at a time when medical abortion, the abortion pill, was not available, it is interesting that the ten to 12-week period in place in their laws is the time period within which medical abortion is safe and now available. Even though that was not the case at the time, it is interesting to see that the time period they set also lines up with the time period for medical abortion being safe, as stated by the WHO. In that context I find it remarkable that the campaigners to retain the eighth amendment are so grievously misrepresenting the facts to the public. Through a combination of online, mobile and billboard advertising, they are putting falsehoods into the ether. Their philosophy seems to be that if one cannot convince them, confuse them and their fake fact floodgates are bursting open across the country as we speak. They have the privilege of free speech, as we all do but when their free speech serves their own ends and not the people, then we have to stand up and say, ""That is not true and is deliberately designed to cause pain"". While we are on the subject of privilege, as I said on Wednesday during the debate on mother and baby homes, it is important that Members of this House, past and present, pause on occasion and check their privilege. I am not talking about the privilege and honour that comes from serving as a Deputy. I am talking about the privilege that so many of us take for granted and can remain utterly blind to, that is, the privilege of being born healthy and able bodied to parents who either raised us themselves or gave us the opportunity to be raised by others; the privilege of being wanted, loved, fed and reared in a safe and secure home, of being valued in a society that was practically designed for us to participate in as an equal, with the economic safety net of family and friends and with every opportunity available to us to succeed and grow. We must all remember to check our privilege from time to time. Some of us may not notice the huge headstart afforded to us by virtue of where, when and to whom we were born. My mother is 70 now and we had a party to celebrate her birthday at the end of January. I talked about her during Wednesday's debate too. She often talks to us about the girls in rural Ireland who had their babies at home and if they did not survive, they were buried at the end of gardens under apple trees. The babies that survived home births to young girls were treated totally differently to other children, were seen as lesser and were made to know it too. There was little sign even then of a willingness to love both, as the girls were judged too. That sexual apartheid was supported by laws and encouraged in an attempt to discipline communities. My mother is not an outlier of her generation. She has many friends her own age with similar stories. They tell tales of only daughters impregnated against their will in order to guarantee inheritance of a father's farm and of teenage girls cycling rattling bikes down dark, narrow roads who were set upon by men. Those men never paid any price for their crimes while the girls paid dearly. People might see this as washing our dirty linen in public but I would ask them to think about those 35,000 women who washed our dirty linen in private. People might resent hearing these stories and might deny that these things happened but these stories are true and these things did happen. We must all accept and not deny what is happening. Already the stains of these grave sins against our women are on all our souls. Those who support retaining the eighth amendment must surely believe that the stains of the many legal and illegal Irish abortions taking place are on our souls too. They must therefore welcome what must be news to them today, namely that repealing the eighth amendment will lead to fewer abortions and less staining on their souls in the long run. The longer the status quo remains, the harder it will be for us to launder the stains out and we do not have 35,000 women trapped in a barren prison anymore to do our laundry for us. That privilege is all ours.";NULL
2327;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. John Lahart;Fianna Fáil;"In a previous contribution on this topic I outlined my own views in favour of repeal of the eighth amendment. I want once more to thank my party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, for having had the wisdom and foresight some years ago to grasp that the issue of abortion and the right to life of the unborn are matters of conscience for members of Fianna Fáil, and for allowing each party member elected to the Oireachtas the freedom and space to articulate his or her own position on the matter without being subject to a party Whip. I will start by mentioning the ancillary recommendations of the Oireachtas committee, which are included in chapter 3 of its report. They have been much overlooked in the debate. These recommendations deal with the provision of the most effective method of contraception free of charge, and having regard to personal circumstances, to all people who wish to avail of it within the State. The committee was of the opinion that there is a clear link between effective sex education and lower levels of crisis pregnancy. I support that and equally support the committee's recommendation that all women should have access to the same standard of obstetric care, including early scanning, testing and anomaly scans, irrespective of their geographic location and having regard to their socioeconomic status. I also support the committee's contention that improvements should be made to counselling and support facilities for women during and after pregnancy, including post termination, and that perinatal hospice services should be made available to women who require them. I strongly endorse those recommendations of the committee which, as I have said, have often been overlooked and constituted a considerable part of the work the committee undertook. My party decided on a free vote of conscience on this issue some years ago. It is worth dwelling on the idea of a free vote momentarily. We should not take the notion of it for granted because free votes are rarely permitted by parties or groupings in most European or Westminster-style parliaments. They are also extremely rare in Ireland, with only four free votes having been identified since 1970. Free votes remove the comfort of hiding behind a party Whip on an issue and demand of everyone a clear indication of where they stand. So it is with the issue before Members today. In today's debate, Members are considering Second Stage of the Thirty-sixthAmendment of the Constitution Bill 2018. The Government has introduced a Bill which, if passed, will give the people of Ireland the chance to vote in a referendum on what we all accept has become one of the most vexatious and debated parts of the Constitution. The Bill gives the people of Ireland the ultimate say on whether Article 40.3.3° ought to retained or repealed. This point is worth dwelling on and is worthy of particular emphasis. As I mentioned in a previous contribution on the matter, there has been much debate as to the make-up and outcome of the deliberations of the Citizens' Assembly on this matter. There has indeed been some criticism of the manner in which the assembly was constituted in terms of its membership. Following on from that, there was further criticism of the manner in which the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution conducted its business, and accusations of bias in a particular direction, particularly as regards witnesses who were invited to give evidence to the committee. In my view, all those arguments, some of which may or may not have had validity, were waved aside once the work of the Oireachtas committee was presented to this Dáil, the democratically elected citizens’ assembly. Those who had criticisms to make, whether of the composition of the Citizens’ Assembly or witness attendance at the Oireachtas committee, have been able to articulate those criticisms forcefully in this House and have done so. Once the debate entered this Chamber, those who felt their voices were ignored or that their views were not given equal weight to contrasting views had, and will have next week and beyond, the opportunity to clearly express their views in an unfettered way. They have done so, passionately and cogently. The matter will eventually go before the people for ultimate adjudication. Each side, in advance of the referendum, will be guaranteed equal access to, and opportunity for, the presentation of its arguments. Finally, on referendum day, after due consideration of the matters at hand, as is proper in a republic, the people will be asked to adjudicate on the matter. The vote of each citizen will have equal weight and my own vote and that of each Member here will be no more or less important than that of any other citizen. I find absolutism on this matter difficult to reconcile with my own life and my experience of life. I have always regarded myself as pro-life and still do. I am conflicted by many aspects of the debate, however. As I said on another occasion, I find it difficult to accept the extremes articulated at opposite ends of the spectrum of discussion: on the one hand the view that completely ignores the unborn and on the other the viewpoint that ignores the rights of women. I do know this much, though; if, as a man, I was capable of being impregnated, there are circumstances in which I would feel entitled to a say in whether that pregnancy was brought to fruition. In such circumstances, having exercised my conscience, I would have to accept and live with the consequences of that conscious decision and reconcile myself to it. However, I would like the choice in certain circumstances. Clearly, it is unnecessary to outline why such a choice does not apply to me. However, paradoxically, as a legislator I find myself in the position of having the power to determine the choices women make in such circumstances. If I would like the right to choice in such hypothetical circumstances, I feel compelled to recognise the rights of women in real circumstances. In Ireland now, as the law exists, a risk to the health of the woman is insufficient to justify a legal termination. The Oireachtas committee concluded that some change is needed in the law. Given the ebb and flow of public debate in the last 30 years, the cultural and societal changes that have taken place, and the practice in other countries as outlined by Deputy Kelleher this morning, many of which have cultural and religious contexts not dissimilar to our own, it is difficult to counter that conclusion. It is difficult to counter it specifically in the contexts of rape, fatal foetal abnormality and incest. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 provides protection for women only where there is a real threat to the life of a woman including a threat of suicide, but not to her health. The Citizens’ Assembly recommended that the termination of pregnancy that is the result of rape be lawful up to a 22-week gestational limit. The Oireachtas committee rejected this gestational period in favour of a period of up to 12 weeks. I believe that it should be lawful to terminate a pregnancy that is the result of rape or other sexual assault, if a woman so chooses. I trust women. Furthermore if, as a man, I was biologically capable of being in such a position, I would feel entitled such a choice. As a legislator, I find myself determining whether women have that choice. I share the committee’s recommendation that it would be unreasonable to insist on the reporting of rape as a precondition for exercising any right to terminate a pregnancy that has resulted from rape or sexual assault. I also subscribe to the committee’s view that there is a need to avoid the further traumatisation of a victim of rape or sexual assault. In the case of foetal abnormality that is likely to result in death either shortly before or shortly after birth, the Citizens' Assembly recommended that termination of pregnancy should be lawful without gestational limit. As many Members have reminded us, the issue of fatal foetal abnormality concerns a much-wanted pregnancy and not an unwanted pregnancy. The Oireachtas committee recommended that it should be lawful to terminate a pregnancy without gestational limit where the unborn child has a foetal abnormality that is likely to result in death before or shortly after birth. I trust women and I share the committee’s recommendation with respect to this provision, if a woman so chooses. Not all women may exercise this choice. The idea does not sit well with me that a woman with a much-wanted pregnancy who is faced with that traumatic diagnosis and who chooses to terminate must, under existing law, travel to undergo a termination and all the concomitant issues associated with it. I and my colleagues recognise that this is a challenging issue for people. The people are entitled to be consulted. For most, it is a decision of conscience. Thankfully we live in a democracy, which entitles the people to the final and ultimate say as to whether or not Article 40.3.3° should be repealed or retained as it is. For me, the answer is clear: Article 40.3.3° needs to be repealed and the Oireachtas, the democratically elected citizens' assembly, empowered to legislate a way forward for women should that repeal be successful. I support the repeal of Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution for the reasons outlined, and I support the findings of the Oireachtas committee in this regard, particularly as they relate to cases of rape, incest and fatal feotal abnormality. I repeat my previously expressed views that my party has always been a warm home for people who have pro-life views, as are many parties in this House. The decision, made some years ago, by the party leader to allow a free vote of conscience on the issue has afforded all of the members of the party the opportunity to express individual and personal views on the issue. My free decision is to support the repeal of Article 40.3.3° for the reasons I have outlined.";NULL
2328;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Jonathan O'Brien;Sinn Féin;I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I pay tribute to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for ensuring that it was debated at the earliest opportunity. As he said in his own contribution this morning, it is unusual for us to be here on a Friday, but I do not believe that anybody in this House or in the Oireachtas had any complaints about sitting today to begin this debate on this Bill. The quicker we have the debate the better, so we can get the legislation into the Seanad and then get the referendum commission established so that the real debate, outside this House, can take place. That is the important debate that needs to happen. On the policy proposals which were produced this morning, it is important to say that they are only proposals. They are guidelines, indicative of what future legislation may look like. However, that legislation will not come to pass until the people have had their say in this referendum. I hope that during the debate on the referendum that we do not get bogged down in what future legislation might provide for. We are being asked one question: do we support the repeal or the retention of the eighth amendment? That is the question that needs to be answered in the first instance. As part of that debate people will argue the pros and cons on each side, and the various viewpoints expressed should be respected. There are some people who were on the committee and there are some within this Oireachtas who will campaign vigorously to retain the eighth amendment, and that is their right. I completely respect that. However, those individuals also need to respect the views of people who have changed their opinions over recent weeks. I include myself in that group. Asking how a person could change his or her opinion on a matter such as this does nobody any favours. If nobody changed their opinion on this matter there would be no need for a referendum in the first place because people had their say in 1983. It is important that people are allowed the space to look at the evidence. I have always believed that no one person can convince anyone to change their mind on this issue. However, a person's mind can be changed if they are open to listening to the evidence presented. That is what I did on the Oireachtas committee. I listened to the evidence with a very open mind, and based on that evidence it was clear to me that the eighth amendment was an impediment to women's health care. I have no doubt about that: it was suggested by all of the evidence. The most controversial aspect, and the most debated of the recommendations to come out of the committee, is the question of unrestricted access to abortion for 12 weeks. It is important to say why the committee arrived at that recommendation. There were two main reasons. The first reason is that it was a clear recognition of the reality of abortion pills today. The second reason is that we looked at how the issues arising from rape, incest and pregnancies resulting from sexual violence could best be legislated for. It is true, as I am sure others will point out, that a number of options were presented to the committee in this regard. I sincerely believe that there is only one compassionate way for legislating on these issues, which is to allow for an unrestricted period of up to 12 weeks during which women can have abortions. I do not believe there is anything compassionate about forcing a woman who has been raped to go to someone and relive that experience so that person can sign a piece of paper which gives the victim permission to have bodily autonomy. That is not compassionate and it is not the way we should approach this. For that reason, the committee decided on the 12 weeks unrestricted access. It was the only compassionate way of dealing with this. Much has been made of the ancillary recommendations and I was glad to see that the Minister focused on them in his own contribution. All of the evidence presented to the committee debunked the myth that when a more liberal abortion regime is in place instances of abortion increase. In fact, based on the evidence, where a more liberal regime is coupled with the ancillary recommendations proposed, including free access to contraception and sex education, abortion rates actually decrease. That is something which needs to be debated further in the course of the public discourse. I will not speak for much longer. I presume that one of my colleagues is going to take up the remainder of the time allocated. I look forward to the passage of the Bill and I look forward to a calm, rational public debate. I hope that, no matter what side of the debate one is on, other people's views will be respected. I hope that people will be truthful in what they say and with the information they present. In recent days I have heard some members of anti-choice or pro-life groups put forward arguments which are simply not factual. Those people are not helping anyone when they do that. I encourage everyone at least to look at the Official Report of the Oireachtas committee and at the evidence which was presented to it before making up their minds and casting their ballots. Whether one agrees or disagrees, I believe it is imperative that everyone goes out on the day of the referendum and has his or her say.;NULL
2329;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Aengus Ó Snodaigh;Sinn Féin;"Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thapú chun labhairt ar an gceist ríthábhachtach seo atá ag déanamh tinnis don tsochaí le tamall rófhada anuas. Is ceisteanna móra iad ceist an ghinmhillte agus ceist an leasaithe a rinneadh ar Bhunreacht na hÉireann nuair a cuireadh an t-ochtú leasú isteach ann. Tá muidne ar an dtaobh seo den Teach go huile agus go hiomlán i gcoinne an leasaithe sin agus molaimid an tAire as an gcinneadh a ghlac sé féin agus an Rialtas fáil réidh leis an leasú sin. Sa deireadh thiar thall, beimid in ann reachtaíocht a thógáil isteach chun déileáil le na ceisteanna a bhaineann le ginmhilleadh agus sláinte na mban. I welcome the certainty provided by Wednesday's Supreme Court judgment on the unborn and the Constitution. The judgment paves the way for a referendum on the eighth amendment. People are looking for controlled change of our laws on abortion. People want to protect women's health and well-being and ensure that doctors can care for their patients here in Ireland. This is only possible if we remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution. What will follow after that will be decided by the people but also by this House. It is clear that society has moved on, as the referendum on same-sex marriage clearly showed. There is an appetite for reform and society demands that the State be in tune with the rights of all of its citizens. We export citizens to access services which many believe the State should be responsible for delivering. We must have equality in health care between women and men in the State but we will not have it as long as the eighth amendment remains in place. A woman should not lose the right to health care simply because she is pregnant. Under the eighth amendment, women lose that right when they become pregnant. I trust women to make decisions that will affect them; the eighth amendment does not. We must be clear in all of the hysteria that will flow from this debate. While I respect those who have an alternative or a different view to me, I have heard extreme views, from some in this Chamber and some outside, and those extreme views do not have any place in the debate that will happen over the next number of weeks. We should be clear that no woman in the State will be forced to have an abortion - not one, not ever. I will campaign to have the eighth amendment repealed and will stand shoulder to shoulder with all the women in Ireland who want to be treated with respect and who want equality and choice and control over their bodies. This is what we should do. It is time to right a fundamental wrong that occurred in 1983. It is time for a human-rights based Constitution that acknowledges women as full people. The reality is that for as long as the eighth amendment is in place, women will continue to be second-class citizens in their own State. There are other sections of the Constitution that also need to be removed to ensure that women are treated in this State as full citizens and not second-class citizens as the Constitution would have them. In the past, this was a State in which the Catholic Church held sway over all in society, or at least tried to. One need only look at the disgraceful and horrific treatment of the women and children who were incarcerated in Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes to see how the State and religious institutions persecuted and oppressed women. Let us not be fooled into thinking that somehow women have all escaped this ill treatment and persecution by the State; they have not. The eighth amendment is one of the biggest obstacles in the State that we must overcome in order to achieve true equality for women. I commend the women who have continued the struggle for equality during the decades. It was certainly not easy. They were vilified by the media, by religious institutions and at the time by much of the political establishment, and some still vilify them to this day. I also commend the new generation of young women who have taken up the fight. We would not be having this debate if it were not for their activism, courage and campaigning. My heart goes out to the women from every city, village and town across Ireland who have had to make the lonely journey to England to avail of something which is recognised in most states as a fundamental right. I have spoken to many of them over the years and they have explained to me how they have been demonised by some commentators and campaigners, and that is shameful. The eighth amendment was inserted in the Constitution 35 years ago and a generation of women of child-bearing age have not been given a say on an issue which affects them. It did not stop Irish women having abortions. All it did was export the issue to Britain which is what the conservative elements of our society have always done. Between January 1980 and December 2016, at least 170,000 women and girls travelled from this State to access abortion services in another country, mostly in Britain. Between those years, based on the British Department of Health and Social Care statistics, at least 168,000 women and girls who accessed abortion services in Britain provided Irish addresses. In 2016 alone, 3,265 women and girls gave Irish addresses at British abortion services and that is obviously an underestimation as not all women provide their Irish addresses when they attend abortion clinics in England. Also, they do not all travel to England. Some go to other countries in Europe, such as the Netherlands. A 2016 report shows that 1,642 abortion pill packages were sent to Ireland in a three-year period between 2010 and 2016. That was the figure supplied by just one provider of the pill. In other words, thousands of abortions have occurred in Ireland in the past eight years due to the use of the abortion pill. We have abortion in Ireland. We just do not legislate for it and provide the proper medical supports that are required and are provided as of right in other countries, and all because an amendment to the Constitution 35 years ago that should never have been inserted into it. There are lessons there for legislators. The Constitution is supposed to be there to protect citizens, not to box them into a corner or to force them out of the country. All too often politicians are too scared to legislate and they go running to the Constitution to absolve themselves of their responsibility as legislators. We can no longer do that, especially when it comes to abortion. We have the duty. We have the responsibility, not just to pass the legislation before us but also to go out there and explain to the public why the eighth amendment needs to be repealed and that we, as legislators representing the Irish people, can be trusted to bring about legislation that will bring us into the modern world and to protect and respect women. Research undertaken by the HSE's crisis pregnancy programme in 2010 showed that 87% of women in Ireland who had an abortion stated it was the right outcome for them. Of course, it is possible to regret having an abortion. It is possible to experience feelings of regret or loss afterwards and I do not wish to erase the experience of women who do. However, it is also possible to feel a sense of relief and closure on having an abortion. We heard repeated earlier, from other spokespersons and others in the Chamber, stories of rape and incest. When one thinks of a young woman or a girl who has suffered horrifically by a rapist, I can guarantee she will feel closure and a sense of relief not having to carry to full term the product of a rape or incest. Similarly, it is possible to regret having placed a child in adoption, having adopted a child, having given birth or not given birth, or not having the choice not to give birth. Such is the variety of human experiences and emotions, significantly restricting women's access to abortion provokes feelings of depression and anxiety and this increases the risk of suicide in pregnancy. This burden is merely made worse by the isolation and stigmatisation felt by these women who are compelled to travel abroad for access to safe, legal abortion services. In terms of maintaining the status quo of exporting the State's abortion services and needs to Britain, there are a few issues to bear in mind. The first is financial. A trip to Britain for an abortion can cost over €1,000. For many this is a prohibitive amount of money, and not something that they can raise easily. Women have had to borrow from friends and family, or take out loans from the bank. Many women who cannot raise the money resort to desperate measures to end their pregnancies. Without the support of the Abortion Support Network which helps many women to raise the money they need for their abortion, there would be many more deaths from botched abortion attempts. The second matter is legal status. For many migrant and refugee women, travelling outside Ireland for an abortion is impossible owing to their legal status. Many of them arrive in Ireland unaware of its strict abortion laws until it is too late. The horrific case of Ms Y in 2014 showed what happened when people who were unable to travel were forced to carry a pregnancy against their will. The third issue is child care. For Irish women seeking an abortion in Britain, organising child care is an issue. Many women cannot tell people that they are travelling for an abortion. If they cannot arrange for someone to mind their children while they travel abroad, they will not be able to go. The fourth matter is health. Abortion is legal in Ireland only where there is an immediate risk to the life of a pregnant woman. This means that women who need an abortion for health reasons must still travel. If a woman has a condition which limits her mobility or means that she cannot fly, it is a barrier to travel. It is time to hold a referendum on the eighth amendment and I will certainly vote in favour of the repeal Bill. I will also certainly campaign in the next number of weeks to repeal the eighth amendment. It is time the issue was dealt with and that the women of Ireland had their voices heard.";NULL
2330;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Joan Burton;Labour Party;"Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo chun Airteagal 40 den Bhunreacht a leasú agus téacs nua a chur ann ionas gur féidir socrú a dhéanamh le dlí chun foirceannadh toirchis a rialáil. Beidh cead ag gach aon duine a bhfuil vótáil acu vótáil. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh gach aon duine ábalta vótáil agus go mbeidh vótáil i bhfábhar an Bhille seo. As we move to pass the Bill, we pass the responsibility for the decision from the Chamber, assuming, as I am confident it will be, that it is enacted, to the people and each citizen who is registered to vote. The Labour Party will speak to people to seek to persuade them to cast their ballots in favour of the proposed change to Article 40 of the Constitution. We will ask them to substitute for Article 40.3.3o the amendment the Minister has proposed. I join those who hope the debate will be a concerned one. It is an important and vital debate which must be a concerned one which will produce a good outcome for the people, in particular women. That is why I want to see a ""Yes"" vote. Yesterday, we put on a brave celebration to mark International Women's Day. We celebrated women who had fought for the right to vote, among others, for women 100 years ago, including the right to control their own fertility. While we, rightly, celebrated the achievements and legacy of the women concerned, we should be honest that we, the women of Ireland, inherited a republic of misogyny and cruelty and a Dáil and a Seanad which remain cold places for women and girls. In 1983 the Labour Party was very clear that the eighth amendment was the wrong one for the Constitution and the people, in particular women. Instead of doctors and midwives providing the best maternal care for women, we have had instead decisions on women's care placed in the hands of lawyers and the courts. In fact, the notes the Oireachtas Library and Research Service has provided show that in the 35 years since the eighth amendment was made, court case after court case has intruded on the most private, sensitive and, often, risky parts of many people's lives, namely, when they are having babies. Instead of the process being dominated by midwives and doctors, it has become the province of lawyers, which is not good for anybody. In the broader consideration of this issue let us put women first, trust them and ensure we provide the best maternal care. It must be clear that when a woman is pregnant and proceeding to have a baby, we want to see a successful outcome. Can we look at what has been happening in this country and how we have dealt with this issue? In some ways, the best thing to do is look at the work of some of our writers, including Edna O'Brien and other young women who ended up having to leave Ireland for pagan England because it was only there that they could resolve their issues. That is what a lot of their literature has been about. I have never been aware of a situation where abortion has been a happy issue for anyone, just as the loss of a baby in a miscarriage is a very unhappy event for anyone who has experienced it. The debate must, therefore, be realistic about the lives of women and their partners and couples and what actually happens. In that context, I refer to the decision of the committee which I absolutely support on a 12-week provision. It is, in fact, quite conservative. Some in the media have allowed themselves to be carried away and indicated that this will turn Ireland upside down. This is the country which sent tens of thousands of young women and girls to England, either when they were pregnant or as soon as they had left the Magdalen laundries or other institutions. By the way, priests met them off the boat, as did people from various religious societies to see if they could persuade them to turn back. During the years I have talked to many people who did what one could only have expected them to do in the circumstances, which was to get the boat to pagan England. In those days it was a boat for the most part. They began again lives which had been interrupted completely and, in many cases, destroyed by what an authoritarian Catholic Church, together with the Oireachtas, had visited on women as the standards acceptable in holy Catholic Ireland. That does not mean that there were not people in holy Catholic Ireland who were not sympathetic and caring, but they always seemed to be outnumbered by those who placed a religious fatwa on those whose sexual behaviour was deemed to be unacceptable, with reference to the norms of the Catholic Church. In a way, that is why the revelations of clerical abuse and other such issues were so shocking and continue to shock. They were so out of line with the presentation of the Republic. We must, therefore, be clear that the 12-week proposal is a conservative measure. That is why we should have a great deal of confidence in proposing it as an appropriate provision in the vast majority of cases in which people want, for their own reasons, to have a termination. Last week in my constituency I spoke to a small group of approximately 20 people, together with a local doctor and a lawyer, to discuss what was meant by the various proposals and what might happen. What stood out for me was that many older people, probably past their child-rearing days, did not really understand how much medical technology and practice had changed. Many who hear about an early termination tend to think about a procedure such as dilation and curettage or a rather invasive surgical process. In recent years, certainly over the past decade, we have witnessed the development and widespread availability, without issue, of the morning-after pill in chemist shops all over Ireland. I was a member of this House when the proposal in that regard was first made. As with married couples having access to contraception and divorce and many other issues, people who were negative about social change really felt and forecast that the sky would fall in. It was felt that if we brought in divorce, all the daddies in Ireland would leave their children. Members will remember the poster stating ""Hello Divorce ... Bye Bye Daddy"". It was believed that if women got the right to control their own fertility and gained access to contraception, they would suddenly go mad. It was not believed that we would never have sex again but that no more babies would be born in Ireland. We have one of the highest fertility rates in Europe. Even counting all the people who go to England to have a termination — it is not an absolutely exact science — all the evidence suggests we have a relatively low abortion or termination rate by European standards. If we get better maternal provision, as proposed and in respect of which I welcome the observations made by the Minister on providing free contraception services, we should end up with services of better quality that will help people to make decisions and result in better outcomes for families. Since the technology of the abortion pill was introduced, girls have been taking it, whether in toilets in colleges or in their own bedrooms. We know that taking abortion pills is relatively safe but there are those who suffer from medical complications and who may be at risk of infection, albeit comprising a very small proportion. We need to ensure they have medical help available and, in particular, aftercare, because many of those young women will want to have a baby in later years. We will want them to be able to do so successfully when that is what they want. For most people, pregnancy is a happy experience. For a small but significant number of couples, however, it ends in spontaneous miscarriage. Everybody knows that. Medical science is seeking to advance its knowledge in this regard and reduce the incidence. For an even smaller number of people, pregnancy ends in a termination or an abortion. For many couples and individual women nowadays, the problem is actually getting pregnant and holding on to the baby. Considering the variety of experiences people have, we have to provide better care for women and couples. The care should reflect the complexity of our lives as they are now lived. While we are aware of our history, we really need to consider what is available now and how we can best address the needs of pregnant women. As everybody has said here this morning, we have abortion for women in Ireland but it takes place abroad, mostly in England or, as I said before, ""pagan England"", as it was often vilified in earlier decades. Much of the relevant information is not really available during people's education in secondary school. It is a sine qua non that if we agree to change the eighth amendment and, as I hope, provide for legislative powers in the Oireachtas, we will provide for better sex education and relationship education in schools in order that the pupils, when they become adults, will be able to decide what is best for them and their families. It is important that there be aftercare. If a person who has a termination when relatively young does not have the medical care she requires, particularly if she picks up an infection, for example, her chance of having a baby may be significantly reduced in later years. We need to examine this as a whole-of-life issue for many women and families. I ask those who intend to vote on this to consider some of what we know. Almost everybody, in his or her wider circle of friends and family, knows a couple or individual who has experienced a fatal foetal diagnosis. At times as a public representative, I have talked to people about very sad issues such as where and how they would be able to find grave space for a baby and whether they – they are usually in their 30s - could find a space where they could be buried with their baby when they die. We should not put them through what is, for them, often casual torture. We need to rethink how people are supported and helped. Consider the case of the 14 year old Ms X. People suggested she be prevented from travelling out of this country. Would anyone like to see his or her 14 year old forced to carry a pregnancy to term if it resulted from rape? Particularly since I lived in Africa, I have not believed the Catholic Church itself believes she should be. Most Catholics do not believe she should. For instance, I do not believe Catholics for Choice in America believes so but one of the peculiarities of our involvement in this cul-de-sac of argument on the eighth amendment is that we have been forced into such places. It is absolutely appropriate and fitting that we now move away from the era of the X case. We must do so with the will of the people, however, and that is why we need to talk to people and respect their views and different stories. It is such a private and personal issue. Ultimately, we must ask the people to make the best decision they can make, mostly for women of childbearing age but also for their children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and wider family. Their views must be taken into consideration. This is what I believe people did in voting in the marriage equality referendum. It made it a much more collective debate. We sat down and thought, as a society, not about what might be perfect but about what would provide the best outcome for the maximum number of people. We addressed that according to a rights framework. One hundred years ago, the suffragettes simply wanted to end the prospect of fertile women ending up having had 16 or 20 pregnancies and to allow women to control their own fertility. Now, 100 years later, we are moving to provide for women to control their fertility here. We know that women can access terminations but must do so abroad. In the context of this debate I remember former Deputy Maureen O'Carroll who lived for much of her life on Kirwan Street in Stoneybatter and later Finglas, on Dublin's northside. During the adoption debates in the early 1950s she was one of the first people to consider the situation of children who would end up in institutions. She was also very far seeing in wanting to end the status of illegitimacy. Looking at the long story, I hope that when people come to vote that they will say ""Yes"" to change and support the proposals in this Bill.";NULL
2331;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Gino Kenny;People Before Profit-Solidarity;Yesterday marked International Women's Day. I was one of thousands who joined with our sisters to celebrate, support and show solidarity to women not only in Ireland but across the world. The atmosphere on yesterday's march was electric and was probably the best International Women's Day march I have ever been on in Dublin. The main theme was repealing the eighth amendment. Hopefully next year, we will celebrate its removal from the Constitution. The vast majority of those who took part in that march never had a vote in Ireland's draconian abortion laws. Young people, particularly, are clamouring for change. They are not prepared to allow the 35 years of fundamentalism by the State and the Catholic Church to define their future. Today we are one step closer to trusting the people of this country and for women to decide on their bodily autonomy. What it comes down to is that people who do not want to see abortion in this country do not trust women. It is about moral control and the institutions which had control over everyone's lives, and especially women, losing that control. Abortion is a reality in Ireland. Twelve women a day travel for a termination, and in my own constituency of Dublin Mid-West two women each week, more than 100 each year, travel abroad for terminations. This Bill does not seek to make abortions compulsory, but is about decriminalising abortion in this State and, more importantly, decriminalising women for making that choice. These women are not criminals. They have gone on this journey to Britain or elsewhere feeling as though they have been criminalised by the State and the church. It is about supporting those women who have made that deeply personal decision, medically and legally. Who has the right to judge them? I do not nor do Members here, the State and particularly not the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church has a nerve to judge women in this country considering its particularly hideous history here. They are hypocrites. People power and the testimony of individual women have brought us to this juncture, not politicians, the church or the State. Only those aged 53 years or over had the chance to vote on this issue in 1983. I did not have a vote. The Minister for Health did not have one. It has been 35 years of hurt, not for us but for the women who have never had a choice. That is a shameful length of time to elapse. It is time to right the terrible wrong in this country and wipe away the past to give people, especially women, in this country a future and a choice.;NULL
2332;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Mick Barry;People Before Profit-Solidarity;"The year I turned 20 years of age, a fundamentalist, misogynistic amendment was written into the Constitution. The year 1983 was 35 years ago. Since then 170,000 women have been forced to travel for abortions. For a new generation and those who can become pregnant today, it is a toxic legacy. It sits on their shoulders and haunts them, an unwanted ghost from a different century. I remember the X case in 1992. A 14 year old girl was raped, and when gardaí were consulted, they told the family they did not believe she could travel to England, that it was against the law due to the eighth amendment. When the High Court was summoned, it said that the family could not travel because of the eighth amendment. It took 50,000 people to come out on the streets, promising they would be back the following week with twice as many people, to force the Supreme Court to overrule that verdict. The 14 year old went to England. Afterwards, we had a referendum and we voted to give women the right to travel. The right to travel is a fairly bitter right and more than 8,000 women each year go to places such as Liverpool and London in secrecy and shame. Every second year there is another case: the A, B, C and D cases; Miss P, Miss Y, Savita, Amanda Mellet and many others. What a country. Who can take pride in any of that? We now have a chance to correct this horrible mistake and to remove the eighth amendment. Ten women daily still travel, with five women taking the abortion pill every day, but are denied medical assistance. There can be no doubt that the amendment must go. The same voices which told us to put it in the Constitution all those years ago, tell us to keep it there. Only this week we were told by the Catholic bishops that it would be a manifest injustice to repeal the eighth amendment. Was it not a manifest injustice that 170,000 women were forced to travel? The Magdalen laundries was a manifest injustice, as was the Tuam scandal and the mother and baby homes. With respect, the bishops may choose to get their own house in order before lecturing women about injustice. I and many others will be less inclined to listen to the voices of bishops than we are to listen to the voices of women and pregnant people, including women who have gone through the real lived experience of crisis pregnancies. In the context of listening to women, my attention was drawn to a Facebook page which was started recently called In Her Shoes. Women can post a selfie on the page but it is a selfie with a difference. They post photographs of their own shoes, and then tell the story of their own personal experience of abortion. It is an excellent and revealing page and the stories are powerful. I will read part of one story into the record of the House. It says: We arrived in Liverpool, got into a taxi, when the taxi man heard my accent he said the address of the clinic without me telling him where we were going - He knew ... When it was all over I remember being so hungry. I didn’t want to go eat in a restaurant, I wanted to go home to my Mam - that wasn’t an option. Another says: ""From the second you're pregnant the 8th amendment suggests that you're not competent to give consent about your care"". Another woman posted: People are still ashamed. The stigma is still there. I don't regret my choice, I never did. What I do regret is the unnecessary journey it took, the unnecessary cost of last minute flights on top of the cost of the procedure. In the course of the debate, I will encourage Members to listen also to the views of the expert witnesses who came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. Dr. Abigail Aiken from the University of Austin, Texas, surveyed the evidence of thousands of Irish women who had taken the abortion pill in recent years. Dr. Aiken found that the profile of a typical woman who took the abortion pill is totally different from the stereotype the anti-choice campaign would have us believe. The typical profile is a woman between the age of 30 and 34, a mother whose contraception has failed. The survey showed that 54% of people surveyed applied for the pills because their contraception had failed. Nearly two thirds, 63%, were already mothers. The biggest single cohort - at 26% or more than one in four - were those aged between 30 and 34. Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, an internationally renowned physician, was another expert to give evidence before the committee. Professor Arulkumaran had chaired the HSE inquiry in to the death of Savita Halappanavar. Professor Arulkumaran told the committee: If abortion is not made legal, it will promote illegal abortion. Those women with influence and financial resources will get it performed in a safe environment. Those who are poor with less influence will resort to unsafe abortions. This would be a social injustice. Those who told us that legalising divorce would open the floodgates were wrong. They now tell us that legalising abortion would also open floodgates. The experts, however, tell us that the Netherlands, which has legalised abortion on request along with free contraception and a national programme of sex education, has the lowest abortion rate in the world. Some men of my generation have asked me what this referendum has to do with them. It is about their daughters and their granddaughters. We need to show support and solidarity and that we respect the decisions that women are sometimes forced to make. I was on the large International Women's day demonstration last night. There was a big one in Dublin, a big one in Cork and others around the country. I saw the new generation, of both genders and none, fighting for a different Ireland and a better Ireland to the one in which I grew up. We should stand beside them and behind them to show support to help them make the change this State needs to make.";NULL

2336;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Maureen O'Sullivan;Independent;"I am sharing my time with Deputy Broughan. I am aware of the wide range of views on repeal or not to repeal. I know it has been a very difficult issue for many people. It has been divisive because the views are deeply held and passionate on both sides. I have attended quite a number of meetings and, as I said in January, met a wide variety of people. I have met women who were hurt by abortion, I have met women who regretted having an abortion and I have met women who were glad they had not gone ahead with an abortion. I have also met those women for whom having an abortion was the right decision. Those women were very upset because, having made that decision, they were unable to have that abortion in Ireland. Let us consider the role of men. They are involved in the sex that creates a pregnancy. I have met men who did not want the termination to proceed and I have met men who did want the termination but the mother did not. While it is predominately a woman's issue, I believe we also need a space for that male view. With the referendum on divorce, we were told there would be a massive increase in the numbers looking for divorce but this did not happen. With the referendum on marriage equality we were told there would be dark consequences to come and that did not happen. It is the same with the repeal of the eighth amendment. I do not believe it will mean a floodgate of girls and women looking for abortions. It just means they can have the termination in Ireland. The reality is that while we debate the issue today Irish girls and women, coming from every county in Ireland, are travelling to other jurisdictions for a termination, or they are travelling back from those jurisdictions having had the procedure. The irony is that girls and women have the right to travel for an abortion. If they have this right then they should have the right to obtain the procedure, medically supervised and safe, in Ireland without the stress and expense of travel. It is expensive to travel so certain girls and women are precluded because they cannot afford the expense involved. This is a discrimination against those women from poorer backgrounds. There is another reality. While we debate the issue, Irish girls and women are accessing abortion pills online. This is unregulated and without medical supervision. Representatives from the medical profession, from those working in the maternity hospitals and from the HSE have real concerns over the increase in those accessing the pills. They also have questions on the safety of the pills. Abortion does happen in Ireland within the constraints of the eighth amendment but abortions have always happened in Ireland when backstreet abortions unfortunately and sadly led to horrific deaths for quite a number of women. Like others, I would prefer if girls and women were not in situations where they have to make that decision, be it an unplanned pregnancy for whatever circumstance, or facing a fatal foetal abnormality with little or no chance of life outside the womb. I hope the other recommendations of the committee that the Minister referred to earlier about comprehensive sex education and free access to contraception are implemented. I believe that sex education has to be about more than just providing facts. It also has to be about personal development, assertiveness and critical thinking. Women from Ireland are more likely to have later abortions and abortions done surgically than are women in the UK or in other jurisdictions where abortion is legal. This is due to the time needed to organise travel and to organise the finances needed, hence the early termination here, when the decision is made. I accept the 12 weeks, but I hope that when the decision is made, the procedure can be carried out as soon as possible. The current wording causes great difficulties for women and for the medical profession, including the possibility of a prison sentence. We have had enough of those legal cases where a letter of the alphabet designated extremely painful, personal situations. Repeal of the eighth amendment will mean abortion is accessible in the State and it will be regulated in line with best international health care practice. The Minister said that termination in pregnancy will be lawful in the circumstances set out and it will be unlawful in circumstances outside of that. At a presentation in the audiovisual room yesterday, Members heard certain statistics and a presentation supporting the opt-out clause for doctors. Statistics indicate that we are not talking about huge numbers of abortions or the need for huge numbers of doctors to carry out the procedure. In the case of the vast number of women and parents involved, the pregnancies will continue. Fears around repeal are alleviated when we consider the facts and experiences of other countries. We are aware of the liberal abortion laws in the Netherlands but it has low abortion rates. It also has the highest number of planned pregnancies in the EU. The Netherlands have liberal and extensive education programmes in the schools and comprehensive health care and excellent counselling services. As we debate the accessibility of abortion in Ireland we also need to look at the care available for those who continue with unplanned and difficult pregnancies. We know the difficulties they face and especially the difficulties for teenage pregnancies. No repeal would mean the travelling for abortions would continue by those who can afford it. No repeal would mean the continuation of buying pills online, with the associated safety risks. I have quoted her previously but for me, the most telling quote came from Dr. Mahony when she said, ""what we as doctors require is clinical flexibility in order that women and their doctors can make appropriate decisions in the very difficult circumstances that arise from complications in pregnancy"". Finally, this is a decision for the voters in Ireland. It is right that they will have their say in May. This is as it should be because we live in a democracy.";NULL
2337;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Thomas P. Broughan;Independent;"I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Thirty-sixthAmendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 before us. I thank Ms Justice Mary Laffoy and everyone involved in the Citizens' Assembly, the members of the Oireachtas joint committee and all those who gave their testimonies to both processes. It has not been an easy task, and I have the utmost admiration for all our colleagues involved who went into these processes open-minded and listened to the medical and legal evidence and personal stories of people affected by the eighth amendment. When the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, announced that there would be a Citizens' Assembly to examine the eighth amendment and then an Oireachtas committee to review the proposals of the assembly, many of us believed it was a can-kicking exercise. However, the process has in fact turned out to be very informative and helpful for many citizens, including Deputies and Senators. Prior to the general election of 2016, I pledged to support repeal of the eighth amendment, Article 40.3.3°, and I will support the Bill. Article 40.3.3° was inserted into Bunreacht na hÉireann in 1983. At the time I was opposed to the insertion of such an amendment into our Constitution because I believed it was wrong to tie the hands of Oireachtas Members on vital areas of public health policy involving women's health and pregnancy. Like many other citizens, I was profoundly disappointed that the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, one of my former teachers, did not stand up to the intense lobbying to change our Constitution during that period. Charles Haughey, who served as Taoiseach both before and after Mr. FitzGerald, was equally supine despite commitments he often made on Irish health care. It is also very revealing now to reread the prescient advice given to the FitzGerald Government by the Attorney General, the late Peter Sutherland, which that Government published in February 1983. Mr. Sutherland advised that the wording of the eighth amendment ""will lead inevitably to confusion and uncertainty, not merely amongst the medical profession, to whom it has of course particular relevance, but also amongst lawyers and more specifically the judges who will have to interpret it"". Unfortunately, those who voted ""No"" in 1983, fearing that legislators would be placed in a straitjacket in respect of women's health issues, were proven right by the litany of tragedies and legal quagmires which have enveloped us since. Sheila Hodgers's cancer treatment, for example, was stopped by a hospital because she was pregnant. She lost her life in 1983 and was also denied pain relief. The X case, in which a 14 year old girl became pregnant after being raped, led to a referendum in 1992, and a subsequent referendum on the right to travel for terminations was passed. In 1997, Ms C, a 13 year old girl, was raped and became pregnant. She was taken into care and there was a court battle regarding her entitlement to travel to access an abortion. In 2007, Miss D, a 17 year old girl who was in State care, received a diagnosis of an anencephalic pregnancy and took the HSE to the High Court to allow her to travel for a termination. In 2010, Michelle Harte had cancer and became pregnant. She was not well enough to travel for an abortion, Cork University Hospital refused to perform a termination and in 2011 she died from cancer. In October 2012, Savita Halappanavar died tragically in University Hospital Galway after being denied a termination while she was miscarrying because of the presence of a foetal heartbeat. Ms Halappanavar's needless death led to the passage of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act in 2013. The Act has seen an average of 25 terminations taking place in Ireland each year since its commencement in 2014. I have carefully studied the transcripts of committee proceedings, as well as the reports by the Oireachtas joint committee and the Citizens' Assembly, and I have considered deeply the stream of emails, letters and calls from my constituents, as I think we all have. I have also met delegations representing both sides of this debate and am grateful for the respectful and informative discussions I have had. The Oireachtas joint committee comprised a cross-party mix of Senators and Deputies and heard from a variety of legal, medical and human rights professionals from Ireland and abroad. The committee heard personal testimonies from two groups representing families that had received the heartbreaking diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality. Some of the committee contributions which I found particularly compelling were those of the consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists, Dr. Rhona Mahony, Dr. Peter Boylan, Dr. Maeve Eogan and Professor Fergal Malone; law lecturer Mr. Tom O'Malley; Ms Noeline Blackwell, chief executive officer of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre; and the chief investigator into the death of Savita Halappanavar, Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran. These witnesses from the fields of academia, law, human rights and health have done a great service to the Government and the people of Ireland, and we must consider their expert opinions based on lived experience and international best practice. All have said that the eighth amendment endangers women and precludes doctors from being able to give the best medical care to women with unintended pregnancies or crisis pregnancies or both. I believe the vast majority of Irish people understand the nuances of very difficult decisions on reproductive rights and know that such decisions to terminate a pregnancy are never taken lightly. I also believe the Irish people are compassionate and caring and want our pregnant women to be able to access health care in this land, at home. I believe they trust women and our skilled medical professionals to make correct private decisions on their personal and family lives. One can be anti-abortion but still support another person's right to make a decision as to whether to continue with an unintended pregnancy. Then there are the tragic and heartbreaking cases of much-wanted pregnancies that become crisis pregnancies when the parents receive a devastating diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality. Any of us who has ever heard members of Terminations for Medical Reasons, TFMR, speak cannot help but be moved by their stories and admire their strength in speaking out. It does not bear thinking about what these families have had to go through in trying to access the health care they need when their heads are spinning and their hearts are breaking and their medical professionals cannot even provide them with the care they need. According to the available statistics, more than 170,000 Irish women have had to travel to the UK or further afield to access reproductive health care since the 1980s. According to today's estimates, approximately nine to 12 women travel each day to access health care in another jurisdiction and approximately three more take safe but illegal abortion pills at home, which they have bought on the Internet, risking 14 years in prison. I have heard colleagues talk about these citizens having to try to access their health care in lonely bedrooms around the country. The eighth amendment affects all pregnancies: those which are much wanted and those which are unintended. A woman who is pregnant is not entitled to consent during pregnancy care and labour and a woman who has made the difficult decision to end a pregnancy is forced to get the funds together and make arrangements to travel to another jurisdiction, usually England, to access reproductive health care. The Citizens' Assembly and Oireachtas joint committee both came to the conclusion that abortion is a reality for many women and families in Ireland and that we should care for our women in every possible way at home and not add the trauma of travelling abroad to the situations of these often very vulnerable fellow citizens at that stage in their lives. I have learnt some notable things that were surprising to me in my discussions and research. I heard a colleague refer to some of these statistics recently. The majority of people accessing reproductive health care are already parents and in long-term relationships. The age demographics of pregnant people also show that a majority of people travelling are in their late 20s and early 30s. We also know that pregnant women travelling from Ireland access abortion care slightly later than their UK counterparts because of the added issue of arranging travel and so on. Among many incisive comments to the committee, Dr. Rhona Mahony said that the current constitutional provision ""facilitates a real possibility that clinical decision-making may be delayed or distorted as clinicians ponder the law rather than medicine"". The eighth amendment has put clinicians in this situation of having to ponder the law rather than rely on their own professional expertise. Dr. Mahony also drew attention to the fact that ""we have the lowest number of obstetricians in the OECD, comprising some 140 to 150 whole-time equivalent posts"" and concluded that by ""any reasonable international standard, that number should be at least twice if not three times as large"". We have drawn the Minister's attention again and again at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and across the floor of this House to the fact that his budget is at least €1 billion short, even for 2018. He has lost some battles in this regard and will have to start winning them. Among the most valuable of the joint committee's work was its ancillary recommendations, as referred to by my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, a few minutes ago, aimed at greatly improving services for pregnant women and seeking more effective ways to avoid crisis pregnancies. These recommendations included major improvements in sexual health and relationships education; decriminalisation, including repeal of section 22 of the 2013 Act; addressing the costs of contraception, on which I heard the Minister's comments earlier, which are welcome; and the provision of an easily accessible and uniform standard of obstetric care across the State. The Oireachtas and the Departments of Finance and Health must immediately begin providing the necessary additional funding to implement these recommendations after the referendum. We have had a discussion about the paper the Minister published today. Gestational limits of 12 weeks are by far the norm across Europe, adopted by a plethora of countries. I think the exceptions might be Portugal, Slovenia and perhaps one other, which have ten-week or eight-week provisions. Most other European countries have adopted a 12 week provision. Ireland has, after Malta, the most restrictive reproductive health system in Europe, with only Malta having an outright ban. Many of the OECD countries highlighted our strict regime as a cause for concern during Ireland's second universal periodic review. I have the list of countries that raised a concern about women's health and pregnancy. A key issue, which has been raised by colleagues who have already spoken, is trusting the House and our colleagues in the Seanad in the future. A fundamental reason I was opposed to the insertion of the amendment in 1983 was I believed it was the task of a parliament to legislate in these areas. We may have wide differences in economic areas, but at the end of the day, we are the people's representatives and it is right that we should take responsibility for these matters. It may not be too long before a future Dáil is much more gender equal. It is right to trust the House and all of our colleagues to address these matters after the referendum. I will support the Bill and I welcome the opportunity for the electorate to have its say, at last, on the matter. No one under the age of 53 has had a substantial say in the matter before us, and we have a whole generation of people who have never before had a vote on something that directly affects them so profoundly. It is imperative that the referendum be held by 25 May in order that the thousands of students travelling for the summer months are given an opportunity to cast their votes. I believe the majority of people want a kinder, better Ireland, where the eighth amendment has been removed from our Constitution so that we can look after our women in their own country, safely, caringly and compassionately.";NULL
2338;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Bernard Durkan;Fine Gael;"I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this particular Bill. I was one of the people who was here in a previous era when discussions of this nature took place on the eighth amendment of the Constitution. To a great extent, a very animated debate took place at that particular time, which has been repeated on a number of occasions since. I hope that on this particular occasion, we will have a more mature and a more regulated debate in terms of keeping the emotion to a minimum, recognising the issue is important. It requires and deserves a full and thorough debate, with respect for one another's views, and it is no harm to say there are vastly disparate views on this subject that have been expressed in this country over the years, and in other jurisdictions also. I hope we can say to ourselves this is a new era and times are different. Our society has evolved and it is a time also for recognising the other's point of view. This is a feature of our modern society. I hope it will manifest itself in the course of the debate as it goes ahead. I have not changed my views since I spoke, as did many other people in the House, on the 2013 legislation on the protection of life during pregnancy. It brought to the fore many of the issues spoken about in debates prior to that as did, funnily enough, the children's rights Bill. For some unknown reason, the same subjects came up in that debate, again on the basis the State was trying to take control of the family and children. In actual fact, the reverse is the case. The State is trying to protect the family and ensure each element of the family has a fair opportunity to develop, evolve and live in a society which, hopefully, is fairer. I could never understand the situation, for instance, with regard to rape. I know there are strongly held views on the subject. If I had a daughter, which I do not, and she was the victim of such a crime I would find it very hard not to consult with her as to what she should do. She should at least have some control over what happened next. She should at least be consulted. It is not fair, and it would not be fair, to say ""tough luck, that was an unfortunate incident"". It is a little bit more than that. It affects the lives of the victims forever, for as long as they are alive. It is incumbent on us to address this issue now and we can do so. This is why, in the course of the committee's hearings, we had to come to the conclusion that the only way to deal with that situation without specifically getting into court cases, lawyers, evidence and counter-charges was to leave it at the 12 weeks that was previously recommended by the Citizens' Assembly. Many people are worried about this. They are concerned about it on the basis it should be less. As has already been pointed out by other speakers, it is fairly average across Europe with one or two exceptions. To leave out the 12 weeks and reduce it further could mean eliminating some cases that would eventually end up in the traditional method of abortion, that of travelling overseas again. It is not something we should try to look forward to. In the course of the hearings, it was patently obvious to everybody that women in certain situations found themselves in a very lonely position and isolated without comfort, advice or counselling. It was for this reason a great deal of emphasis was placed on the whole issue of counselling. We looked at a number of other countries throughout Europe, some of which have adequate counselling and some which do not. It was concluded there was a need for counselling, greater emphasis on sex education in schools and greater emphasis on back-up and counselling for a woman who might become pregnant in a crisis situation, and there are multiple reasons as to how that could come about. We had an adequate opportunity during the period of the hearings to look at the situation whereby it was said in the past that women would arbitrarily seek out an abortion as a means of birth control. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was no evidence to suggest that at all, good, bad or indifferent. In fact, the reverse was the case. There was clear evidence adduced in the hearings to the effect that women wanted the pregnancy to go right and wanted to produce the baby even if the baby was not perfect. They still wanted the pregnancy to go right and felt they had a requirement to do so for some reason - maternal instinct - they had in their own minds. In those circumstances the lack of adequate counselling was patently obvious. It was just appalling to listen to the type of stories being told, whereby they were isolated and left on their own with no advice whatsoever, so they had the choice of going abroad or staying at home and being in doubt for the rest of their lives, or suffering the consequences. There are those who have said in the past the whole issue of suicide was myth and not real. Again, nothing could be further from the truth. In the course of our business as public representatives, Members all have met people who have had mental problems around crises in their lives. Because of this, it is incumbent upon us when dealing with this particular situation to so do in the clear knowledge we might be dealing with what could ultimately become a tragedy. It is in our interests, in the interests of the people of the country and in the interests of fairness to try to accommodate, as public representatives, the situation that can develop. I want to mention briefly the type of situation that brought about a lot of emotive argument in the past. An example is a threat to the health of the woman as opposed to a threat to her life. Very little emphasis was placed in the past on how quickly the situation can accelerate from a threat to health to a threat to life, and then it may be too late. There are a number of well known medical conditions that can accelerate so rapidly it may be too late when it becomes obvious to the physicians that action should be taken, or should have been taken and was not. Other speakers have enumerated a number of situations where this, in actual fact, did take place. It is no harm for us to think carefully about this as we speak at this time on these issues. We need to put ourselves in the shoes of the woman who might find herself in that type of crisis situation. What would we expect to be done if we were in that position ourselves, as a man or a woman? The least we would hope for would be that society would be, in some way, on our side and, in some way, cognisant of the situation we were going through, that our health could ultimately be at risk and that we had a medical condition which might accelerate rapidly and leave us with little choice. We must also consider a person in those circumstances who knows they have a condition that would lead to that situation. While everybody ponders it and various opinions on the right thing to do are sought, their condition and chance of life is deteriorating all the time. In those circumstances, there is nothing we should do other than show compassion and care for the person in the eye of the storm, that is, the woman in a crisis pregnancy. There is also the issue of incest. In this country, we have a peculiar history concerning rape, incest, institutions, mother and baby homes and so on. I have spoken about this before, as many of us have. It was not a problem solely related to the churches. It related to our society, and to other societies in other jurisdictions. It was a blight and a blot on respective societies and jurisdictions that they did not have a bit more care and compassion when dealing with women who found themselves in a crisis pregnancy. Despite the other great achievements of Irish and international society, it was sad that a little more thought and compassion was not put into the area of mother and baby care. There was no recognition that in certain circumstances a woman might find herself isolated, alone and condemned. In many cases, that is what they found. This gives us an opportunity to again examine all the factors affecting the situation. Of course there are contradictions. Everybody has feelings for those born and those as yet unborn. There is no doubt about that. There are many contradictions. On balance however, in accordance with laws nationally and internationally, we cannot have a ridiculous situation where a mother is kept artificially alive while a baby is allowed to mature for an unreasonable period. It is so sad that we should subject people to that kind of treatment in this day and age. It is equally sad that the only option for women in that situation was to send them abroad because no facilities were available at home. Surely it would have been better if we had regulations and controls at home as well as the necessary medical back-up before, during and after. That is something that this legislation proposes to do. It is no harm at all to consider that there were a number of referenda on this subject. At one point it was intended to stop the right to travel. That failed. It was not on; it did not happen. In the back of people's minds, they know that there is a right for the woman to travel to seek the service that is not available in our own country. It is not convenient for her to do it. It is a lonely old trek. However, she can do it. It is legal. As such, it is not true to say abortion is not available in this country. It is not available in this jurisdiction, but it is available to people from, and who live in, this country who want to go to another jurisdiction. Incidentally, I am not in favour of abortion per se. I never have been. However, there are circumstances that have arisen, which we have discussed, in the last several years where there is an obligation for us to move with the times. We have to move along. Society is evolving, as it should. We cannot remain embedded forever in history. The past is not a good place to go, as we know. It has been suggested that the proposals in the legislation will ultimately mean abortion will be available without restriction, but of course it is available already. It is available via the Internet because women can access abortion medication without regulation and without medical supervision before, during or after, and without any counselling and advice. One of the things we learned about during the hearings was the urgent need for advice and counselling. Women must be able to rely on medical and sometimes psychological advice and information to help them reach a decision, which might not lean towards abortion in all cases. They might not go that route at all. However, they need the advice. The last thing we should do is isolate women in that situation, to leave them on their own, let them put up with it or work it out for themselves. With this legislation, the decision is in the final phase. It is now over to the people. It is true the people have decided on this issue before but they will decide on it now. Both sides in this argument have sought for a referendum for many years since 1983. Obviously, they sought it for different reasons. The time is now. It is now incumbent on everybody to ensure that the maximum amount of information is put into the public arena, into the hands of the people. That way when people go to decide, they will have the information at their fingertips and they can vote accordingly. I hope that they will do so in a way which will show compassion. If there is a need for other regulations, it will be shown up in the course of the debate and in the ultimate vote. It may well be a very narrow margin on either side. Then again, it may not. One never knows with these things. It is important that those who make the decision, that is, the people, have all the information available to them without a slant or restriction in one direction or the other. In the final analysis, they will be able to make a compassionate decision, taking into account both sides of the argument without restriction, and recognising what history has shown us over the last several years. They will be able to recognise all the things that went wrong in past. This presents them and us with an opportunity to address those issues and right some of the wrongs of the past. I am not an expert on these issues. I have to make up my own mind like everybody else. I intend to support the legislation and the Bill, as proposed, as I did in the committee. I did not change my mind, as I said to many people in the course of the debate. My argument now is the same as it was ten years ago. It may be right or it may be wrong. I do not know. The people will decide that. When they decide it, the decision will stand for quite a long time. It is something with which our society will have to live for a long time. My last point concerns something we changed in the course of the committee hearings. We removed the proposal that the court could no longer review a decision of the Oireachtas, and that is as it should be. We were right to do that. It was important to do that clearly and unequivocally in the course of the argument. In a modern democratic republic where we have a dual system of the courts and the Parliament, the courts must ultimately have the opportunity to review and challenge, as they have done many times in the past. That proofs what we are doing. The point I want to refer to is this. Some say that nobody trusts politicians. That is like saying that nobody trusts the people, because the people elect politicians. When the people go to elections and elect politicians, I presume they do so in the clear knowledge that these politicians will represent them and their views. If people claim not to trust politicians and stand aloof from it, then they must stand aloof from politics too because everybody who gets involved in a public debate in one shape or form gets involved in politics in one shape or form or another. It is no harm to remember that if we do not trust politicians, then we do not trust the people because the people are obviously guilty of some misbehaviour if they elect politicians who are not trustworthy because they do not represent them. I do not accept that argument at all. Those arguments can resolve themselves. It is a matter for the people to elect the people they want to represent them. It is a matter for those who are elected to represent the people to the best of their ability, fairly, equally and in a way that they can look back on afterwards and say that they did the best they could. The time has come to trust each other to some extent. It is also time that we recognised the huge contribution that women have made to society and that Irish women in particular have made to our society. It is time to trust them, particularly in this year, with the current celebrations of the suffragette movement and International Women's Day. These things may only happen once a year and are all coming together. The fact is that the women who made these contributions to society over the years have to be trusted. They were trusted and we have to trust them now.";NULL
2339;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Kevin O'Keeffe;Fianna Fáil;"I have spoken already on this topic. I will make a few more points today and, hopefully, get a better balance in the Chamber. Many, including Oireachtas Members and my constituents, will know that I am against the repeal of the eighth amendment. I was there in 1983. It was a divisive campaign but, luckily, we live in a democracy and the democratic decision was taken. We had a Supreme Court decision two days ago and it highlighted for me the importance of the eighth amendment in this country and the amount of lives saved. I am concerned with the way we are moving forward. While some say it should have been started before now, there seems to be an effort now to rush the process through to get everyone in the electorate on board because people feel that they can take for granted the electorate in various quarters - that is to say students - but I assure Members that there are many students who are against the repeal of the eighth amendment. Do not get carried away and think that any sector of society is under control. I respect everyone's views. What happens in here is that we get various organisations being criticised. This morning, the church was being castigated. It has no form of defence in this Chamber which is a bit worrying in a way. It was accountable for issues which happened and should not have happened but one cannot mix all those issues up with this current issue. As everyone has acknowledged today and over the last months when talking about it, it is an important issue. Much was made of International Women's Day yesterday and I commend all those who participated in the celebration of 100 years of women voting. I, too, acknowledge that many issues relating to women still need to be addressed but I see things improving greatly. Women's representation in the Dáil is not great but I know from involvement in other sectors that there are many great women at the forefront of some of the major companies in this country, such as Glanbia and FBD Insurance. I am on the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport where the head of the National Transport Authority, a lady, came before us, as did the head of the Road Safety Authority, a lady. Do not feel that we have been shy in acknowledging the role of women. Any women I deal with are able to fight their own corner. I wish them the best. What we have here is the issue of the foetus, of the unborn, who do not have a say or a means of fighting their corner. On page 11 of today's Bill digest is the line ""legislate to address termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn and any rights of the pregnant woman"" and that Article 40.3.3° should be repealed. That is why I am here today. I felt strongly about it. I watched much of the proceedings on my iPhone and, during the day, all but one or two Deputies have steamrolled the issue of the repeal of the eighth amendment. One would think that 99.9% of people are in favour of repealing the eighth amendment. The impression that one would get from this Chamber today is that there is an overwhelming majority. It concerned me. I have to apologise for a few colleagues who could not be here today. They would love to be but because of the prevailing circumstances and short notice, they were not able to be here today to speak on behalf of the retention of the eighth amendment. We talk about giving women recognition. While I said things are slow, during the last 12 months as a Dáil we have extended parental leave rights to the husband. The husband must have a part to play with the newborn as well and in the creation of the newborn. As a man, I feel no problem in speaking here even though I am single. Talking to other people, it is felt that the man plays no role. I respect the rights of women. Health issues need to be addressed. While I will put my hand up and say that I did not read their reports entirely, from what I have seen I do not think the Citizens' Assembly, or for that matter the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, took on board alternative proposals or suggestions regarding what could be done to avoid total repeal of the eighth amendment. I say that because it is ironic that the Minister, in his deliberations today, is rushing to improve matters in his speech this morning. He said: We have published Ireland’s first ever national maternity strategy. The Health Service Executive, HSE, has developed national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death and bereavement teams are being established in each maternity unit. The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, now has national standards for safer, better maternity services. Every woman from every corner of Ireland should expect and be able to access the maternity services she needs. Our priorities for 2018 include improving quality and safety, developing community midwifery teams and increasing access to anomaly scans. There is mention of other issues. Why were these proper supports and advisory services not in place before now? These things are a chance to work for the betterment of those who find themselves pregnant, perhaps in an unwanted situation. Would I be in agreement with the 12 weeks? I am not in agreement with anything but just criticising some of the things. Just because other counties provide for abortion before 12 weeks' gestation does not mean we have to follow suit. We are members of the EU but there is much legislation and many services in other countries that we do not have in Ireland. Rather than making comparisons, we should be able to stand on our own. The people of this country have been good at making known their decisions. The Government must think of the impact of this legislation on the youth of the future. If the eighth amendment is repealed and further legislation in this regard is enacted at the end of the year, it will lead to a cull of the youth of the future. There will be fewer young people as a result of this legislation and I do not know, therefore, how the Government can say it is thinking of them. It is more or less telling an unborn he or she will not be here in the future. As regards conditions such as foetal abnormality, I refer to the comments of Sabina Higgins, who said it is an outrage against women that in the case of foetal abnormality a person should be made to carry the baby to term. Kathleen Rose, the daughter of Tracy Harkin, has trisomy 13, which is one such condition. Will there be a rush job in such cases? If such a condition shows up, will the woman be straight off to an abortion clinic? The child may suffer no problems resulting from the condition after he or she is born. There could be minor difficulties but such people can still live and enjoy life. I have been to so-called mass of the angels funerals, seen small coffins carried by the mother or father to the graveyard and witnessed how emotional the parents are because of the premature death of a baby. Such babies must have had a life. Does life start after two days, eight weeks or 12 weeks? I admit that no one has been able to give a straight answer to that question and I am still open minded in that regard. However, I believe that life is present within the first few weeks after conception. As regards walking away from responsibility, people being able to access abortion pills online is a manifestation of global interference in our society. Similar issues such as cyber-bullying and the age of consent in regard to accessing mobile phones and so on have recently arisen. That age of consent in Ireland is likely to be 13 rather than 16 because we cannot beat the system put in place by the companies that provide the technology. It worries me that we would acquiesce to such a problem. More care facilities are needed. I am delighted to speak on the issue of the eighth amendment and I will be against its repeal. I was a candidate for election in 2016 and one of the biggest commitments I made during that campaign under the name of Fianna Fáil was that I would not support the repeal of the eighth amendment. However, with all due respect to my party, I now speak as an individual because of the decision by my party not to make a political statement on the issue.";NULL

2342;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Fiona O'Loughlin;Fianna Fáil;I disagree with the comments of my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, but I respect his views and his right to air them in the House and elsewhere because there is no doubt that any debate on the eighth amendment is very divisive. We can see the evidence of that within families, communities and political parties. We have had the opportunity to listen to much debate on the issue. Most of the debate in the House has been very respectful and understanding of the views of other Deputies, which is very important. It is an opportunity for a reasoned and respectful debate and it is to be hoped the same will pertain outside the House. For any of us to have a real understanding of what the eight amendment is about, we must walk in the shoes of women who face or have faced a crisis pregnancy, those of their partners and those of doctors who have worked under conditions that were not always clear cut. There is no doubt the eighth amendment could be viewed as a platform for massive inequality, given that the last vote on the matter was in 1983 and that the women whose lives are today directly affected by the amendment have never had the opportunity to vote upon it. Very few women of childbearing age have had the opportunity to vote on it. Life has changed, as has the world and people's life experience. In the past ten years, my views on and understanding of the situation have changed. We cannot get away from the fact that reports from the UK Department of Health and Social Care indicate that at least ten Irish women a day travel to the United Kingdom, without medical help or family support, for abortions and put themselves to huge cost in so doing. There were more than 4,000 such journeys last year, with 5% of the women involved giving my home county of Kildare as their address. Free will, responsibility and choice are very powerful. Using that choice and free will to make the right decision for oneself is important. My choice may not be what another woman would make, and vice versa. For almost all women, unless they have gone through an horrific situation of rape or incest, to hear that they are to give birth nine months hence is a cause of great joy and for many it is the most wonderful news they could hope to hear. However, to then get the tragic and sad news that the baby may not survive past birth is an awful situation and I could not dictate to any woman in such a situation how she should feel, deal with that crisis or what she should do. Ireland is a very caring nation and a referendum, vote or amendment on an issue such as this will never please everybody. However, we have a duty to try to do the right thing and give the best information possible to the people of the country to assist them to make their decision. As a society, we know far more than we did 30 years ago and have learned much about ourselves as a nation. Ireland now welcomes people from other nations of the world and is required to welcome those fleeing war, abuse, death or violence. Such people arrive to a country that has very little choice and many restrictions in terms of abortion. Although Irish women have the choice to make the difficult decision to leave Ireland and have a termination, there are women living in Ireland who cannot leave this country and that choice is, therefore, removed from them. However, I do not think any woman makes such a choice lightly. Everyone contributing to this debate is entitled to express an opinion without being labelled pro-life or pro-choice. As far as I can see, everyone, including myself, is pro-life but to be labelled as one or the other can cause great disrespect. We must ensure that every woman who has a crisis pregnancy has the opportunity to deal with that pregnancy and, it is to be hoped, the State would provide the help and support needed to cope with a baby, possibly in adverse circumstances. A referendum is the right way to go. However, we have to be clear and unambiguous about the wording that would replace the current wording. Thankfully my political party, Fianna Fáil, has agreed that Deputies and Senators will have a vote of conscience. That is why myself and Deputy O'Keeffe can share this speaking time and come from completely different views. I looked at the policy paper published yesterday by the Government and there are a few items worthy of note. The key thing is that the question of whether to amend the Constitution is for the Irish people to consider and determine by way of referendum. The policy paper is important. Obviously, it is only relevant in the event that the proposed referendum on Article 40.3.3° is passed. It is important this information is out there now. The 21 policies listed will require further scrutiny, refinement and definition, taking into account legal advice. I want to refer to three in particular, policies Nos. 1, 2 and 14. Policy No. 1 refers to the termination of pregnancy on the grounds of a risk to health, which includes the risk to the life, of pregnant women. That is so important. Policy No. 2 refers to making no distinction between a risk to the physical health and the mental health of a woman. I think that is crucially important. In respect of policy No. 14, the general scheme would provide for conscientious objection, in line with that provided with the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act 2013. That is also important. Medical professionals who do have a conscientious objection to dealing with the possibility of a termination would have the right to remove themselves and another medical professional would be recommended.;NULL
2343;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Katherine Zappone;Independent;"I am sharing time with Deputy Fitzpatrick. I am pleased to speak in support of this Bill to bring about a referendum on the eighth amendment. At the outset, I acknowledge the leadership and empathy of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to bring us to this point. For more than three decades pregnant women in Ireland have recognised and lived the restrictions imposed by the eighth amendment on their reproductive lives. Thousands have left this country to access lawful abortion elsewhere. Thousands more have imported medication, abortion pills, and self-administered terminations in their own homes. We have no way of knowing how many women have continued with pregnancies they did not want, have suffered severe health consequences from pregnancy or have harmed themselves in the attempt to bring their pregnancies to an end. As a feminist, a progressive and a lifelong activist for social justice, I am proud to be a part of the Government that now asks these Houses to ask the people is this a situation that we are willing to endure. The proposal of a referendum on repeal of Article 40.3.3° has come about not only through the excellent work of the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment but, fundamentally, through the decades of civil society activism that has highlighted the impact of the eighth amendment and through the bravery and generosity of people, including some women in this House. I greatly acknowledge their contribution in telling their stories of the eighth amendment. These stories cannot be ignored. Across the thousands of submissions to the Citizens' Assembly, people told us about the hardships they suffered to access abortion and about the desperation they experienced from pregnancies they did not want. One of the experiences relayed in the Abortion Rights Campaign submission is of a woman who was raped by a man she considered to be her friend. When she found out she was pregnant, she decided she could not, as she put it, continue with the pregnancy that brought so much pain and destruction in her life already. She took a train to Dublin, slept overnight in the airport and took a 6.50 a.m. flight to the UK. She had to stay in a hostel and could not even experience her bleeding and loss in private. Instead, she had to try to sleep in a 16 bed dormitory because she could not afford a hotel. She was treated kindly by nurses and bus drivers. When she got on her return flight, there were three other women travelling on their own who looked exactly like she did. They never said a word to each other but they did notice each other. That woman did not access aftercare until ten months had elapsed because of the stigma she felt was attached to having had an abortion. This is not what should happen to someone who has already been the victim of a terrible disrespect for her right to decide what happens to her body. This woman should have been able to access the abortion care she needed here in Ireland. However, the eighth amendment made that impossible. Another woman's submission relays how in 2005 her abortion saved her life. It allowed her to go on and have children later in a secure and safe environment where she could provide for her family. Another woman again, part of the ""In Her Shoes"" Facebook project for first person narratives, tells us she accessed abortion care because she already had two existing kids but with a myriad of issues. She had no money, a rocky relationship and felt continuously at the end of her rope already because, before the pregnancy, one of her children required a huge amount of extra care. She simply could not care for her existing family if she had another child. Yet another woman told of how she got pregnant with her husband. He left her with five children already to take care of and refused to support those children. She accessed abortion care because she could not care for another child. She never told anyone she had an abortion. Again, another young women told ""In Her Shoes"" about her boyfriend, whom she trusted. He had been removing the condom during sex without her consent, a highly abusive practice known as stealthing. She then bought abortion pills online. Her powerful words stay with me. It was not her choice to be a mum. It was not her choice to have a child with a man that did not respect her body and her boundaries. She said she was sorry over and over again and realised she was also saying sorry to herself. This was such a sad position to be in. She was alone, bleeding, keeping a secret and taken advantage of by a guy she thought was good. I relay these stories because the question of whether to repeal the eighth amendment is not some abstract Constitutional conundrum. It is about real life. Life is difficult. Life is sometimes messy. There is no typical person who accesses abortion care. More than half have been using contraception that failed. Many already have children. Many are in stable relationships. Some are adolescent girls for whom I have a special ministerial responsibility. Some are unwell and cannot cope with the physical and emotional costs of pregnancy. Some are poor, some are rich, some are old and some are young. Some are families who long for the safe arrival of their much wanted child but are devastated by an unexpected diagnosis and decide that their parental love will not allow them to have that child suffer a painful and short life and death. All are people who made decisions about what they can and cannot bear. I refer to ethical decisions, decisions that are right for them. Now, we must let the Irish people make a decision. Do we want to force women to make these decisions in shame and in stigma in the shadows of the State? Do we want to continue to prevent doctors from caring for their patients where they agree that ending a pregnancy is the right course of action for them? Do we want to continue to rely on the kindness of strangers in another country? I refer to taxi drivers, hoteliers, nurses, pharmacists, doctors and Irish emigrants who provide warm beds and financial support to meet the needs of women who have lived in this country. Or do we want to make sure that people can make decisions for themselves in their own country and in their own home? If we think that change - any change - is needed to make our law better and to meet the needs of pregnant people in this country, then we must vote to repeal the eighth amendment. If Members of this House believe that the decision about the future of the eighth amendment is not ours alone nor that of the electorate of 1983 but is rightfully the decision of the Irish people, then we must vote to support this Bill.";NULL
2344;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;M;Mr. Peter Fitzpatrick;Independent;"I listened with consideration to the comments made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, this morning. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I am particularly interested in this issue and have made my views well known. I would like to take this opportunity to address the Government's current plans. I believe today to be a very sad day indeed. No matter how we try to describe what we are doing today, abortion involves the ending of a human life and removing the eighth amendment will lead to more abortions taking place and more babies losing their lives. I believe that our role as legislators is never to promote or campaign for laws that would end human lives. The debates we have in this House should be about laws that are intended to improve lives and protect the vulnerable. At meetings of the Oireachtas committee, there was a real denial of the reality throughout the country. No women were invited who could talk about how their abortion negatively affected their lives. No families were invited to talk about the children who are alive today thanks to the eighth amendment. No families were invited to talk about the children they adopted as a life-saving alternative to abortion. If the committee was not prepared to invite these families, then we cannot in all honesty sit here and say that we have acknowledged the reality of what is actually happening in Ireland today. Instead, we have only looked at one side of the debate and I must take issue with the Minister on this point. We have buried our heads in the sand when it comes to looking at all of the good things that the eighth amendment has done for Irish society. A few weeks ago, a group of volunteers visited my home town of Dundalk as part of the ""Lives Saved"" tour. They were there to highlight the number of people who are alive in the Louth region thanks to the eighth amendment - an estimated 2,900 people. These are people who are walking around the streets of Louth, going to school or college, building lives of their own. They are not invisible statistics but they and their families have been invisible in the debate so far. These are families where a woman found herself unexpectedly pregnant and initially panicked and considered abortion. In a country like the UK where one in five pregnancies ends in abortion, this initial panic usually brings a woman to the door of an abortion clinic where the life of her unborn baby is ended but in Ireland, things have been different. Women who have faced unplanned pregnancies have the space and time to think about their situation. They get support, find help and are encouraged by family members so they do not need to end the lives of their babies. It is these kinds of situations that make up those 2,900 people in my home county of Louth and all over Ireland as well. These people are alive because of the eighth amendment but their stories are not being listened to. They were not even allowed to appear before the Oireachtas committee and I do not understand why they do not seem to matter to so many people who want to stand up here and talk about the eighth amendment. I have listened to the Minister talking about improving supports for women and their babies but it is strange to be discussing them during this debate. How can we be realistic about providing supports on the one hand while on the other we are saying that it is okay to end the life of a baby? This is what it boils down to. Abortion ends the life of a baby. The unborn baby is not a clump of cells and we need to be honest about that. The baby’s heart starts beating at just three weeks in the womb. He or she has eyes, a nose, mouth, tongue and eye lids at just six weeks. The baby’s organs are developing at eight weeks and at 12 weeks the baby can suck his or her thumb. Just think about that for a second. We call ourselves a democracy but we are spending hours today discussing a law that would end the life of a baby at 12 weeks when that baby can suck his or her thumb. This is not democratic. This is not compassion or kindness. That is what this law would do and I am not happy with that. I believe that there is something far better that we can do for women and their babies. We could look at adoption. This is something which is life saving and provides a way for women to avoid abortion even if they do not feel that they can then go on and look after their baby as he or she grows up. We all know someone who has been adopted. We know the joy and happiness that it can bring to the families involved. Adoption gives new hope to so many people but when I attempted to discuss it at the Oireachtas committee, there was no interest in going down that road as a life-saving alternative to abortion. By all means let us improve supports for families but let us not pretend that today is about anything other than ending the lives of babies. If we go ahead and remove the eighth amendment, we know that vulnerable people will be targeted. We only have to look to the UK, where 90% of babies diagnosed with Downs syndrome in the womb are aborted. Again, some people do not want to talk about this but we have a duty to talk about it. As legislators, we have a duty to children diagnosed with disabilities just the same as to everyone else. We need to look at how the laws that we introduce will affect those babies. When we look abroad, it is a very worrying situation. At the moment, the eighth amendment protects these children. If we remove it, they will be left with no protection under our laws. I have been very honest about how I feel about this issue. I listened to all of the hearings during the Oireachtas committee sessions but I was not convinced by those who made the case for repeal of the eighth amendment. Having looked at all of the evidence, I believe that the eighth amendment has contributed hugely to Irish society. People are walking around Ireland today thanks to these few lines in the Constitution. It has protected women and their babies while at the same time ensured that doctors in Ireland have been able to provide an excellent standard of care for women while they are pregnant. Removing the eighth amendment would have a tragic effect on our country. It would lead to more abortions taking place. This would mean that more babies would lose their lives and more women would suffer from the loss of their baby and the other negative effects of abortion. Women and their babies deserve far better than abortion. They deserve a proper discussion of how to provide real supports that will improve their lives but these supports should not be set beside the removal of legal protection for unborn babies. As legislators we have a responsibility to look after everyone living in Ireland. The way to do that is to keep the eighth amendment and work to improve supports for women and their families. Anything else would lead to the loss of human lives. We can and must do better than this. I will be supporting keeping the eighth amendment.";NULL
2345;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage;09.03.18;F;Ms. Marcella Corcoran Kennedy;Fine Gael;"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this incredibly important legislation. I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and his team for being ready with the legislation following the recent Supreme Court judgment. Unexpected pregnancy has featured in the lives of women and men in this country and globally for as long as we have existed on this planet. A woman's choice to end a pregnancy has been the subject of great debate in Ireland for decades. In considering this Bill, it is important to look back in order that we can move forward. Abortion was initially outlawed in Ireland in 1861. The relevant sections of this nineteenth century Act remained in law in Ireland until 2013 when they were repealed by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act. It remained a criminal offence for doctors to perform an abortion in this country for 152 years. It is absolutely shocking that legislation from 1861 had such an effect on the medical profession in this country. We only have to think back to the Magdalen laundries, to Ann Lovett, the Tuam babies, the Kerry babies and so many other heart breaking cases to be reminded of how pregnant women suffered at the hands of both the Church and the State. In considering from where we have come, it is important to look at the availability of the termination of pregnancy in Ireland and how we arrived at our current position. In 1965 in the Griswold v. Connecticut case, it was held that the US Constitution implies a fundamental right to privacy and that a ban on contraception was in breach of this right. This was expanded in 1973 in the Roe v Wade case. In that case, it was ruled that within this right to privacy was the protection of a woman's choice to have an abortion. Ivana Bacik said this case was a catalyst for conservative forces in Ireland to lobby for a constitutional referendum to reinforce the legislative prohibition on abortion. It was Griswold v. Connecticut which was particularly relevant in McGee v. the Attorney General in 1974, as it was in this case that an unenumerated right to marital privacy was outlined. In Ireland, this ruling led to the legalisation of contraception and, particularly, was influential for the referendum on the eighth amendment even though the case itself was not about abortion. There were fears that if this right to marital privacy could be interpreted from the Constitution, a right to abortion might also be gleaned as per Roe. In 1983, as we all know, the eighth amendment to the Constitution was introduced. In it, ""the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right."" It is my view, and I do not think many would argue with me, that the aim of that amendment was to prohibit abortion being carried out in this country. In that regard, it has failed dramatically, as we know by the evidence presented to us by the Citizens' Assembly and the joint Oireachtas committee that we charged to examine the assembly's report. Next we come to the X case in 1992. This case required that the courts examine for the first time how the right to life of the unborn and the right to life of the mother interact. The ruling was that if there was a substantial risk to the life of the mother, including a risk because of suicide, abortion was to be permitted. While that was a step towards liberalising abortion laws in Ireland, this progress was not matched by the Legislature. We did not react to the ruling at all. There was no new legislation introduced, meaning that the 1861 Act was still in force. This led to great legal confusion for the people on whom we depend most, the medical community. We reneged on our responsibilities in this House at that time. What we did instead was have a referendum in 1992, namely the failed twelfth amendment referendum. This would have stated that suicide was not a substantial risk to the life of the mother for the purposes of obtaining an abortion. The failed twenty-fifth amendment vote in 2002 would have removed suicide as a substantial risk to the woman's life in terms of permitting abortion and would have introduced new penalties for anyone performing such a procedure. I am talking about women's health care in this regard. Women's health care has no place in the Constitution in my view yet, every step of the way, we have prevented women who needed health care from receiving it by pursuing them through the courts or by obliging them to pursue their rights through the courts. That is completely unacceptable. In 2006, the case of D v. Ireland took place. We hear people referring to the cases of A, B, C, D, X and Y. Let us remind ourselves that in all of those cases, we are talking about human beings - young women who were hoping to have lives, who have brothers, sisters and partners. They are all different cases but we are talking about human beings in our own society. We are not just talking about abstract concepts but people who laugh, cry, are happy or sad and who had aspirations but wound up in the very difficult position of having an unexpected pregnancy. In the D case, at the European Court of Human Rights the woman argued that she had to travel outside the country for the purposes of obtaining a termination for a fatal foetal abnormality. She argued that her human rights had been breached. Unfortunately, it was established that she had not exhausted all possible domestic options before travelling and therefore there was no breach. Another element of the right to life of the unborn which the courts have had to establish is what exactly counts as the unborn. In 2006, the case of M.R. v. T.R. and others took place, which dealt with in vitro fertilisation, IVF treatment. It established that an unborn child must be in the womb. Again, the ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court and was upheld. In the case of A, B and C v. Ireland, three women brought a case against Ireland who had all had to travel to the UK to obtain terminations. Thinking back to Savita Halappanavar, it was when we were considering the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill that people began really to realise the legal status of what we have in place here. As those of us who were in the House at the time can recall, we legislated very narrowly in that Bill. Under the provisions of the Act, it is still very difficult for women to obtain the treatment they require and it is also difficult for doctors to define what a real and substantial risk is to a woman's life. Máiréad Enright and Fiona de Londras argue that the court judgments were not written with guidance to doctors in mind. Although the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill was written for doctors, the core test it requires them to apply in determining whether a woman is entitled to a life-saving abortion is an unvarnished transplant of the X test. It is very sobering and crystallises matters for me that, under the current legislation, it can be less of a legal risk for a doctor to allow a pregnant woman to die under his care than for him to perform an abortion in Ireland. That is incredible to me. The attempt to balance the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the unborn seems to disregard the health of both, as things stand. Therefore, focusing on the life instead of the health of the woman is extremely challenging. It raises questions. Does an inviolable foetus assert its right to life against a pregnant woman? The Y case is another tragic case. Again, we have to think of the humanity behind the latter. The events took place with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 in force. She was an asylum seeker who arrived in Ireland and, having been raped on her way here, discovered that she was pregnant. She contacted the relevant authorities seeking an abortion and was told she would need to travel to England in order to terminate her pregnancy. That was impossible as she was an asylum seeker with very little money and restricted travel authorisation. She attempted to get to the UK but was denied entry and sent back to Ireland. As time went on, she was disturbed, concerned about her status and told medical staff that she was suicidal and would die rather than have her baby. Eventually, she attempted to take her own life and went on hunger strike. She was told that a termination would be performed if she started to eat again - this is the awful reality of what we are subjecting people to in this country. In the end, a court order was obtained to force feed and hydrate this young woman and she was forced to deliver a baby by Caesarian section. In heaven's name, is that not enough of a reality for people who are thinking about this to be able to say it is wrong for that to have happened to that young woman? She came to Ireland to seek asylum and what did we force her to do? We forced her to have a baby, conceived as a result of a rape, delivered by Caesarian section.";NULL

2348;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Lisa Chambers;Fianna Fáil;"We have an opportunity now as an Oireachtas and as a country to right what I believe is an historical wrong and something that has caused harm and pain to thousands of Irish women, and in many cases their partners and families. As a member of the cross-party Oireachtas committee that examined this matter and looked at the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, I feel I can say that after almost four months of work on that committee, meeting for around seven hours per week and doing many additional hours of preparatory work, I am quite well-informed on every aspect of this debate. I have heard hours of evidence and testimony on this matter. I do not believe that anyone can seriously suggest that the matter has not been properly debated or that proper process was not followed. We had a Citizens' Assembly, chaired by the eminent Ms Justice Mary Laffoy. We then had the cross-party Oireachtas committee on the eighth amendment, and we now have debate here in this House, with the entire process culminating in a vote by the Irish people in a referendum. We have properly discussed and debated this issue at length and the time for talking is very much over. It is now time to vote on the issue and to move forward.There are those who challenge the process and have attempted at every opportunity to undermine it simply because they did not like the outcome. No evidence has ever been produced to back up the spurious claims that the Citizens' Assembly or the Oireachtas committee were somehow rigged or biased. The reason no evidence was forthcoming is because those claims were ridiculous. It was a cheap and lazy potshot across the bow by some who say that they do not like what they are hearing and do not like the outcome and that the only explanation is that the process must be wrong. The process was not wrong. It was properly conducted and I was very proud to be part of that process. I am sure if the process had produced for them a more palatable outcome they would be singing the praises of the process and everyone involved. Various figures have been put forward for the numbers of Irish women who have travelled to the United Kingdom for an abortion, such as 200,000 since 1970 or 180,000 since the eighth amendment was inserted into the Constitution in 1983. However, we cannot know for sure because those figures only take account of the women who gave Irish addresses when they went to the United Kingdom. Many women did not do so and the overall figure is, therefore, higher. The key point is that the eighth amendment does not stop Irish women from having abortions but, rather, exports the problem to another country which it allows to care for Irish women. Abortion is very much part of Irish life. I shudder to think of the situation we might be in were it not for the ease of access to the United Kingdom, although I suspect we would probably have dealt with the matter long before now if we had been unable to lean on our neighbour. The women who have been silenced to date are listening intently to the ongoing debate. If we retain the eighth amendment, we know that legislatively we have gone as far as we can. With the eighth amendment in place, abortion is only permitted in circumstances where the mother will die. That is the status quo. For those who wish to retain the eighth amendment and, therefore, the status quo, it is worth outlining what that means. It means that a woman who becomes pregnant as a result of rape or that a young girl made pregnant by a family member will be forced to carry the pregnancy to full term against her will and cannot obtain an abortion in her own country. A woman who self-administers the abortion pill is liable to be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison, even if she is pregnant as a result of rape, while her rapist may receive a prison sentence of seven years or less. A woman who has been advised by her doctor that her health will be severely affected by her pregnancy does not have the option of terminating the pregnancy in her own country. Such a woman may be too ill to travel to the United Kingdom or elsewhere and may have other children at home, but that does not matter. A family that receives a devastating diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality in a much wanted pregnancy will not have the choice of terminating the pregnancy in this country. If they choose to terminate it in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, the doctors caring for the woman and her family up to that point will not be able to make the journey with them or even make a referral. Irish women will continue to travel to England to access abortion services or go online to order the abortion pill which they will self-administer at home without medical oversight, as many have done. That is the status quo and what retaining the eighth amendment will mean. I welcome the opportunity to directly address some of the key concerns raised by those who are against repeal or unsure of how they will vote. I wish to make it clear that they are genuine concerns which should not be dismissed or left unaddressed. Disability is an issue that, unfortunately and disappointingly, has been used to advocate against repeal. Some who argue against repeal have stated providing abortion services in this country will mean advocating to terminate pregnancies where there is a disability. That is a deeply disappointing argument to make and path to take in the debate. I am totally opposed to disability being used as a ground for abortion. I wish to make it clear that this issue was debated by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution which voted categorically against it being a ground for a termination. It is not and should not be part of this debate. Many families of children with disabilities such as Down's syndrome have stated they are utterly disgusted that their children are being used in this way in the campaign. For that to be done is totally wrong. It has been alleged that abortion will be on demand and unrestricted. Nobody is suggesting abortion be unrestricted. The term ""on demand"" is deeply insulting to women. We do not suggest one should be able to walk into one's local convenience store and purchase an abortion pill as one would a box of Panadol. What is being proposed is highly restricted and regulated and will be carried out in conjunction with the medical profession. Women buy abortion pills online and self-administer them without medical supervision. That is unrestricted. It has been argued that GPs will be unable to cope with the demand for abortion services. Doctors for Choice has stated that is untrue and that there is no evidence to support such a claim. Even if only a small number of GPs were to opt to provide abortion services, the demand would amount to approximately one patient per week for each GP. It is untrue that GP services would be overwhelmed by demand. It has been suggested the right of doctors who do not wish to provide abortion services to conscientiously object will be undermined and taken away. I support the right of every doctor operating in this country to conscientiously object and not provide the service. All that such doctors will be required to do is to refer a patient seeking an abortion to a GP willing to provide the service. The suggestion the right to conscientious objection would fall away or be undermined is not backed up by facts or evidence and is scaremongering of the highest order. Another argument brought forward as a key concern is that there is uncertainty as to what legislation will be enacted should the eighth amendment be repealed. Legislation indicative of what will be proposed will be put before the people who will be able to see what it is proposed to put before the House if the eighth amendment is repealed. If citizens of this country, having seen the proposed legislation, then vote to repeal the eighth amendment, they will be endorsing that legislation and I will support the vote of the people in that regard. The idea that we cannot trust politicians, as suggested by some politicians, does not hold water. That politicians have themselves suggested this is ridiculous. Deputies are elected to legislate. That is the purpose of this House and every Member of the Oireachtas. If the people do not like what we do in this House, they will have their say at election time and in the polls. That is how our democracy functions.
It has been argued that abortion rates will increase exponentially, that there will be queues around the corner and that the only reason for the current rate of abortion is that women are too lazy to travel, whereas if it were easier and more convenient to procure an abortion, women would be lining up to do so. That suggestion is deeply insulting to women. No woman makes such a decision lightly or would flippantly seek a termination without consideration of what she was doing. The idea that rates will rise and that women will be queueing around the corner is unfounded in evidence or fact and deeply hurtful and insulting to Irish women. During the debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill in 2013 it was suggested the floodgates would open as a result of its enactment. The floodgates did not open and we did not have an avalanche of women seeking abortion under the Act. The suggestion was completely disproved and there is evidence to back it up. The debate should always be based on evidence and fact. It has been stated hard cases make bad law. When asked to address the difficult issues I have outlined such as cases of rape, incest, fatal foetal abnormality or a threat to a woman's health or life, persons who oppose repeal of the eighth amendment and abortion services in this country will often deflect, skirt around and attempt to ignore these very real issues. As a Deputy and a legislator, I do not have the luxury of ignoring the difficult cases. How could anyone deflect or skirt around the horrific cases that have come before the courts in the form of many letters of the alphabet such as those of Ms X, Ms C, the A, B and C cases, Ms D and Savita Halappanavar? It is a list of which we should be ashamed and shows that the hard cases are not that rare and are increasing. Let us reflect for a moment on the current constitutional position. The eighth amendment makes abortion illegal, except in cases where the mother will otherwise die. The thirteenth amendment expressly permits a woman to travel to obtain an abortion in another country, while the fourteenth expressly allows a woman to receive information in Ireland on abortion services in another country. The hypocrisy displayed in the amendments is quite stark. The Constitution provides for a not-in-my-back-yard approach to abortion. I wonder how those who oppose the repeal of the eighth amendment and do not wish to see abortion services in this country feel about the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments. Are they advocating that we repeal those? Should we begin to stop pregnant women at the airport? If not, why not? If one is totally against abortion and believes it is never justified or necessary, why then are we happy in this country to expressly write into the Constitution that Irish women can go abroad to do something which is illegal here? Why would we allow such a situation to prevail? Are those people happy to maintain the criminalisation of women who have abortions here in Ireland? Are we okay with leaving a potential 14-year sentence for having an abortion, by means of self-administration of the abortion pill, on the Statute Book? I have heard some people who oppose repeal of the eighth amendment say they do not wish to see women prosecuted for having an abortion or for self-administering the abortion pill. Why is that? If we want it to remain illegal, why are we not seeking to prosecute? I maintain that people see the reality of the situation and that it would be a very slippery slope if we were to pursue such a line. It would set us back 100 years. Clearly, they realise how barbaric a situation it would be to lock up a woman for terminating a pregnancy for whatever personal reason she felt she could not continue with it. It should naturally flow from that position that we should decriminalise abortion in our laws. The abortion pill has been debated widely in recent weeks and months. Its widespread availability in this country was undoubtedly a key factor in helping the committee reach its decision. Ms Justice Laffoy asked us specifically to look at that as the Citizens' Assembly did not have enough time to do so. Some 1,600 deliveries of the abortion pill were made to this country in 2016 and the number is increasing as awareness of the pill's availability increases. The evidence to the committee from medical professionals is that the abortion pill is being taken without any medical supervision and women may be afraid to seek help if something goes wrong, due to criminal sanction. It is the view of the medial profession that this situation is unsafe and poses a real and genuine threat to the life and health of women and girls in this country. It was the strong majority view of the committee that the situation needed to be regulated and made safe as it was only a matter of time before something went wrong and a woman or girl in this country lost her life.

A key part of the report was the ancillary recommendations on sex education and contraception. Unfortunately, that is not getting much attention in the media. Perhaps that is because it is not the most contentious issue and there was widespread support for the recommendations. We must do all we can to reduce crisis pregnancies and to educate women and young girls properly on how to protect themselves in terms of increasing the use of contraception in this country. Even with all the supports and education, there will always be a need for abortion services. We cannot get away from that. Women need to have full control over their health and future family and no woman should have the trauma of rape, incest or a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality further compounded by a lack of compassion and full and proper health services in her own country.

Some aspects of the campaign to date have been disappointing but in other respects it has been heartening and respectful. I am heartened by the respectful debate in my own party. Many of us have opposing views but we have been able to debate the issue in a mature manner and have respect for one another and our differing views. I very much welcome and appreciate the free vote on this issue afforded to my colleagues and me by our party leader and our party policy because I fundamentally believe that it is a very deep and personal choice for each individual member to make. In making that personal choice as a Member of the Oireachtas and in advocating a position we are having an impact on girls and women in this country, and we are having an impact on the provision of proper health care and we must be conscious of that and very cognisant of the impact of our position and what we say.

I mentioned earlier the 200,000 or so Irish women who have travelled to the UK for abortions. They might not talk about their situations or experiences and neither might their partners and families but what the statistics show - I accept they are not the full picture but they give us a clear indication of the reality - is that those women are in every corner of the country, in every county and constituency. It is quite likely that we all know a woman who has been through a very traumatic situation and has made that very long and lonely journey to the UK or elsewhere. I ask people to be very respectful and compassionate and that they are careful with their language and how they articulate their position. While I will always argue and defend the right of every citizen and every Member of this House to have an opinion and to hold their own personal view, it is worth remembering that the statistics we cite are real women who walk among us every day. They may have been silenced but they are very much listening to the debate in this House and outside of it. A fact that is often overlooked is that the eighth amendment does not affect all women equally. I do not believe I am equally affected as others because my means are different from those of other women. Many women have the financial means to travel to the UK but those most affected by our laws are the poor and most vulnerable women in society, namely, refugees and those too sick to travel. The country is failing those women. In the end, this is a deeply personal and private matter for a woman and the decision should be taken by the woman in conjunction with her doctor and her family.

The debate has the potential to become very hurtful. I have spoken to people involved in the referendum debate in 1983 and some of those who participated, on both sides, say they found the entire process very difficult and that it has stayed with them to this day. The one thing we owe to those women who have been affected and to those who will potentially be affected is to keep the debate respectful and to ensure the facts and the evidence are to the fore. We must not mislead the public in any way. The referendum commission will have a vital role to play in that regard. They key message I have got from speaking to people is that there is confusion, a lack of facts and a lack of information. People are looking for answers to genuine questions. I believe most people are somewhere in the middle ground, which we hear about a lot. We owe it to the citizens of this country to put forward the facts, address their questions honestly and genuinely and show respect for both sides of the debate. If we do that, ultimately I believe the Bill will go through the House in a respectful way. No Member of this House should ever stop the people having their say. The Bill is only asking whether we will allow the Irish people to have a vote on the issue. It is not asking whether one supports repeal or not. It is 35 years since the amendment was inserted into the Constitution and it is important that those who are, arguably, most affected, namely, young women, should have an opportunity to have their say and make their voices heard both to this Parliament and this country.";NULL
2349;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Louise O´Reilly;Sinn Féin;"
I am delighted to finally get an opportunity to speak on the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018. This is incredibly important legislation that will finally give a whole generation of people the opportunity to have their say on the eighth amendment and Ireland's effective constitutional ban on abortion.

The repeal of the eighth amendment is necessary in order to ensure that Irish women have access to proper and appropriate health care. The eighth amendment should never have been placed in the Constitution. It was a mistake and bitter experience over decades demonstrates that. I have spoken about that on a number of occasions and I have referenced my parents and people like them who campaigned against the insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution in 1983. At the time people warned what would happen. They were not fortune tellers and they did not have crystal balls but they were people who listened to doctors and women and they could see what would happen. History shows us that they were right and that we need to repeal the eighth amendment.

We need only ask the masters of the maternity hospitals - the men and women we trust to look after our daughters and friends. They have told us, clearly, in a way one could not misunderstand or misinterpret, that the eighth amendment is an impediment to them in doing their job. Dr. Rhona Mahony, master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, said it is clear that the eighth amendment does not protect the best interests of mothers or babies as a result of the chill factor it imposes in respect of what medics can do, whether in routine or emergency situations.

As has been highlighted at the Citizens’ Assembly and in other fora, the criminalisation of abortion causes a chilling factor for women seeking medical care, as well as for health care staff providing such care. The criminal law plays a major role in creating a chilling factor for women in getting post-abortion care. Women are less likely to present at their doctors after an abortion in Ireland, which would be carried out illegally, or a legal abortion overseas. That puts them in distinct danger in even getting aftercare.

The eighth amendment was never about morals or ethics: it was about the control of women. It finds its genesis in a sexist and conservative State with sexist and conservative social values which dominated society for decades. The core driver of such conservatism and sexism was a church obsessed with control and the pursuit of its warped vision of what it believed to be a moral society.

The insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution in 1983 was the collective reach of ultraconservative elements within the State into an area of health policy in order to control women and their bodies. The fight for the removal of the eighth amendment is a fight to give women back control of their bodies and to restore the termination of a pregnancy to an area of medicine where it is between a woman and her doctor and not a matter of national social policy. Women should be trusted to make decisions about their own bodies and medical needs.

The referendum provides us with a historic opportunity to ensure finally that compassion and trust in women prevail. We have heard the evidence from experts. We have heard indisputable facts. We have heard the evidence from the experts on why they believe the eighth amendment must go. That evidence is available. We heard it at the committee and at the Citizens' Assembly. It is freely available and I encourage everybody to acquaint themselves with the facts in advance of this referendum vote. It does not suit the narrative put forward by the anti-abortion lobby, which is reminiscent perhaps of what was being said in 1983, but we have moved on. Just because the facts do not suit their agenda does not mean we should not discuss those facts.

It is not lost on anyone that even at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution there were representatives who appeared before it and made misleading claims. I had to write to the Icelandic and Danish Governments to ensure they could defend themselves against the misinformation put forward at the committee by some of the representatives. I had to invite them to put facts on the record and not misinformation.

It is little wonder, therefore, that the anti-choice side have now hired a company with close ties to Cambridge Analytica. For anyone who does not know, Cambridge Analytica is a company which combines data mining and data analysis with strategic communication for the electoral process. It has been accused of harvesting and using the personal data of millions of Facebook users and is under suspicion as to whether that data was used to influence the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election or the Brexit referendum.

As The Times Ireland edition reported, Thomas Borwick, who it is reported used to work for Cambridge Analytica but who set up his own company Kanto, has been hired by an Irish anti-abortion group. This is who the anti-abortion and anti-choice groups, which will be party to the debate on this referendum, have turned to in order to maintain the status quo. They are organisations that do not deal in facts, but which no doubt help to disseminate fake news and propaganda. The Data Protection Commissioner has every reason to be worried and to start investigating to make sure that the arrival of Kanto to this State to work with one side in the referendum debate means that data protection laws could be breached. I believe the Data Protection Commissioner should investigate this matter.

Similarly, the latest campaign by the anti-abortion side carried advertisements with a man who claimed to be a scrub nurse who spent years assisting in operating theatres when abortions were being carried out. The only problem with this was that it was completely fake. The man was not a scrub nurse but was a hospital porter for eighth months and he has been found out for having falsified a qualification document. That is what we will be up against. Those are the opponents of women’s rights and the opponents of the repeal movement.

Women have fought and continue to fight for equality. We do not want to go back into the boxes in which the patriarchy tried to put us in 1983 and the decades thereafter. We want the eighth amendment repealed and we want legislation to allow compassionate access to abortion in this State. We cannot say Irish women do not have abortions. They do. We all know somebody who has been affected by it. Irish women have abortions every day. With the advent of the abortion pill we cannot even say, as we did years ago, that they have abortions every day but they just do not have them here. They do have them here, every day, and we cannot deny that. To continue to deny that is to continue to perpetuate the kind of place Ireland was in 1983 and we have moved on.

I use this opportunity to call on the leaders of all other parties to do what their job title suggests and provide leadership on this issue. The women of Ireland will not thank us if we do not provide leadership. They will not thank us if we use this referendum to score political points.

On days like this and when we debate the eighth amendment we should remember Ann Lovett, Sheila Hodgers, Joanne Hayes and all those women who have been served so horrendously by the State. For them, our daughters and our granddaughters, we can and must repeal the eighth amendment.

That is why I am very proud to be a member and a supporter of the group Together for Yes. It is a civil society group that will be launched on Thursday and it is calling for a ""Yes"" vote in the referendum - ""Yes"" to repeal the eighth amendment. The group is made up of supporters from all walks of life. The one thing that unifies us is that we want to acknowledge that this is a modern State. We want the State and its laws to reflect that. We do not want to live in the Ireland of 1983.

Yesterday was the anniversary of the death of Sheila Hodgers. Sheila was a friend of my mother and I have spoken about her on a number of occasions. She died 34 years ago yesterday and her baby died two days later. Sheila was treated horrendously by this State. She was let down. Her two beautiful daughters were left without a Mammy. Her husband was left without his wife and, as I said, her baby died.

That was Ireland in 1983. That was the State we lived in in 1983, and it was because of women like Sheila that women like my mother got out and campaigned against the insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution. They lost, not because they were wrong. They were not wrong. We see now that they were right. We have an alphabet soup of misdeeds. We have Savita Halappanavar and all the women who have been so badly let down by this State. We know that people like my mother were right in 1983. They lost because they were up against powerful vested interests, groups with deep pockets intent on ensuring that women and anyone with a progressive mind did not have a voice in the State at the time. It was absolutely wrong.

I have said this previously and I will echo what has been said by other Deputies. This can and should be a respectful debate. People are entitled to their own opinions and views. Within my party we have debated this at our Ard-Fheis and at many ard-fheiseanna. As recently as yesterday and on the anniversary of Sheila's death, our ard comhairle announced that it will put forward a motion to the next Ard-Fheis in June which makes clear the direction of travel for the party, but it will be done in conjunction with and guided by our members and we will respect, as we always do, the decision of our members.

This motion reasserts that abortion should be available where a woman's life and health or mental health is at risk and in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.

It supports the joint committee's findings that it is not possible to legislate for abortion in the case of rape in a compassionate way. It recognises that Irish women already access abortion services every day in other countries or through abortion pills purchased online and accepts that abortion without specific indications should be available through a general practitioner-led service in a clinical context, as determined by law and licensing practice for a limited gestational period. The motion does not provide for abortion on demand or the opening of the floodgates but offers a proportionate response. I support it wholeheartedly and I will campaign for it in my party.

It is important that we trust women and do not go back to 1983. We must consider what has occurred as a direct result of the eighth amendment. We must decide to trust women, do the right thing and look to the new generation of young women, which includes my daughter. We should look to those who did not have a say in the referendum of 1983. While I have spoken about that referendum many times, I did not have a vote at the time because I was only a child, although I remember the campaign was bitter and divisive. The forthcoming campaign should not be bitter or divisive because it will be characterised by a fact-based discussion. We will be led by doctors and medical professionals, not clerics or those who seek to moralise.

Irish women have always had to fight for rights. They fought for the right to vote and to access contraception and the removal of the eighth amendment is our next fight. We often look back and speak about the revolutionaries of the past. Two weeks ago, when I looked out at the rally for repeal of the eighth amendment, I saw a large number of young, unmanageable revolutionaries wearing black jumpers inscribed with the word ""Repeal"". These young women and men will make history of their own. We owe it to Sheila Hodgers, Ann Lovett and Joanne Hayes to say to these young women that we do not want to go back to 1983 but instead trust women and put their health care in their hands and the hands of doctors. Women's health care should not be in the Constitution. We have an opportunity to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution and do right for a new generation of young women.";NULL
2350;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire;Sinn Féin;"This is a welcome, overdue and vitally important Bill. Above all else and regardless of how people will vote, it is right and proper that they have their say. No person affected by the eighth amendment and no pregnant woman or woman of childbearing age has had a vote on the article in the Constitution that has caused so much pain and suffering. It was heart-rending to listen on ""Morning Ireland"" to the testimony of a mother who was given a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality as she recounted her awful journey home and the additional heartache and suffering she endured because the care she needed could not be provided at home.

I welcome that members of the public will finally have their say on this crucial issue. I commend the efforts of campaigners who placed this issue on the agenda again. It is extraordinary that some of them have been fighting for the repeal of the eighth amendment for decades. The issue should not have been long-fingered in such a way. I also commend Members of the Oireachtas and other institutions who have brought us to the crucial point at which a referendum will be held. I hope the campaign will be successful and conducted in a respectful and mindful manner. I hope it will not be bitter or divisive. Members of the Oireachtas have a specific responsibility to show leadership in that regard. While debate in the Houses has been largely respectful, there have been exceptions and I hope Members will be respectful when they knock on doors during the referendum campaign. People are perfectly entitled to their views on this matter. Some people close to me will vote differently from me and I know many who have not yet made up their minds. People deserve to have their opinions respected but that responsibility applies to both sides of the argument.

I echo the concerns raised by Deputy Louise O'Reilly regarding potential interference by companies that may be manipulating or abusing data and I hope the Government will carefully monitor this issue. It underlines the need for the establishment of a permanent referendum commission.

I am proud that I will vote for repeal of the eighth amendment. I stand by my statement in a previous debate that a vote for repeal is the moral, ethical and right thing to do. I emphasise that the case for repeal cannot be simply restricted to a recognition of a hard reality, although this too must be part of the discussion. Not only must we recognise that women are having abortions both here, through the abortion pill, and abroad, but we must also point out that it is right and proper to repeal the eighth amendment. Those of us who argue for repeal should make clear we believe we are on the side of right because forcing women to go through pregnancy against their will is manifestly wrong. Repeal is right because the eighth amendment puts survivors and victims of rape through the most inordinate torture, psychologically and physically, and forces them to travel abroad. It is right because the amendment forces children to go to term unless they go abroad, puts the lives of women at risk and has resulted in deaths. Repeal is, therefore, right and moral.

The proposed gestational limit of 12 weeks is the only truly compassionate way of legislating for instances of rape, fatal foetal abnormality and incest. While other ways may be available in theory, none of them is compassionate. The proposal for a 12-week gestational limit is the only compassionate way to deal with this issue. This is a personal opinion and, like Deputy O'Reilly, I will support the motion to be discussed at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis and enthusiastically advocate adopting it as policy. I hope the campaign proper will begin when the legislation is passed. Tá súil agam gur rud stairiúil a bheidh ann, go gcuirfimid deireadh leis an gcuid seo d'ár stair agus go ndéanfar an t-ochtú leasú a aisghairm. I hope that, at the end of the campaign, we will be able to reflect finally on the end of what has been a dreadful episode in Irish history, namely, the inclusion in the Constitution of the eighth amendment.";NULL
2351;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Alan Farrell;Fine Gael;"
I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the Bill and cast my vote to commence the process of holding a constitutional referendum. Regardless of whether Members believe the eighth amendment should be repealed, I, too, ask all Deputies of all parties and none to allow citizens to have their say on this matter, which is extremely important to many of them. Recent censuses have consistently found that the majority of people in the State are women. On that basis and given that 30 years have passed since the eighth amendment was passed, it is appropriate that we acknowledge that women are perfectly capable of looking after their health and well-being. For this reason, the constitutional ban on abortion, the only such ban in the world, should be repealed and a proper debate should take place in the House on the realities facing many women in this country.

No citizen under the age of 53 years has had an opportunity to cast his or her ballot or have his or her voice heard on Article 40.3.3° and the eighth amendment or whether the Constitution is the most appropriate place to provide for the governance of our abortion laws. In my view, the governance of abortion law would be appropriately dealt with by the Oireachtas rather than in the Constitution.

However, it is not our job to decide what should be in Bunreacht na hÉireann and that is the duty of the people of Ireland. We, as representatives of the people, are merely custodians of the Constitution. As such, I am appealing to all my colleagues, whether pro-choice or pro-life, to recognise that all of us in this House are democrats We are all elected here and seek the votes of our electorates within our constituencies. We should acknowledge that people have the right to a say on this matter as it is not the preserve of Members of this House or the Seanad to determine whether the article should remain within our Constitution.

Having made my position on the eighth amendment very clear in this House on 18 January, I wish to acknowledge the statement of the former Attorney General, the late Peter Sutherland, who in 1983, prior to that referendum, indicated his belief that the eighth amendment was flawed and would not guarantee what the proponents of the amendment had in mind. Only a few short years later the eighth amendment was pierced by the Supreme Court. I cannot deny that the eighth amendment has led to uncertainty in a number of medical cases, which have been outlined in great detail by my colleagues in Sinn Féin. I see no reason to further add to their comments as they did a good job at eloquently outlining certain very public examples. I refer to the fact that there are probably hundreds if not thousands more cases with equal amounts of tragedy that perhaps did not get into the public domain over the past 30 years. However, if the people decide to repeal the eighth amendment, we in this House will be able to legislate and to ensure the medical needs of pregnant women are taken into consideration in all instances.

In this debate we must be cognisant of the fact that replacing Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution with provisions to allow for abortion in the cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape, or incest would simply not be practical or workable either in legal or health terms. In effect, we would be placing women, particularly in the cases of rape or incest, on trial for the right to access proper medical health care. Many have outlined tragic circumstances, both in the print media and elsewhere, which are heart-wrenching, but the eighth amendment is completely inflexible. For that reason we should legislate and have a full debate in this House. We should agree the legislation, line by line, if the Irish people determine that Article 40.3.3° should be no more. It would be impossible to legislate for abortion in circumstances such as rape or incest in a way that provides women affected by such cases with the medical care and compassion they so richly deserve. This is one factor that shaped the work of both the Oireachtas committee on the eighth amendment, and, prior to that, the Citizens' Assembly. I reiterate my support and compliments to all the members of those bodies for that work.

There are many realities that must be tackled with regard to abortion. It is simply disillusionment to believe that women in Ireland are not accessing abortion, as they are, of course. As the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, stated in this House, since 1980 the number of women who have travelled from Ireland to other countries to access abortion is estimated to be at least 170,000. To act as if Irish women cannot or are not accessing abortion would be tantamount to burying our heads in the sand with respect to the experiences of those 170,000 women. To contextualise that number, it is enough to fill Croke Park twice, Semple Stadium three times and Páirc Uí Chaoimh almost four times. It is a significant number of people that the eighth amendment has simply ignored.

The availability of abortion pills is a reality we must address. It is a fact that abortion pills can be ordered online and delivered to this jurisdiction with relative ease. I know one constituent who did this; the pills were ordered on a Sunday evening and arrived three days later on Wednesday morning. Not acknowledging the importance of addressing such a matter would be a dereliction of responsibility in this House, regardless of the outcome of this debate on Second Stage of this Bill. There is nothing we can do at all about abortion pills if the eighth amendment is retained, other than perhaps withdrawing the constitutional amendment that facilitated women travelling, being provided with information or individually going through every package that arrives into the State. That is simply not practical. The availability of abortion pills cannot be dealt with while the eighth amendment remains in place. Women who access and purchase these pills do so in secret and take them behind closed doors without medical advice or health care. Surely, it must be the priority of this House and all its Members to ensure that women are protected and are accessing such medication with medical supervision, and in an appropriate environment. We should not be ignoring these facts based on what some might perceive as Christian morality. Furthermore, we must address the cases whereby women who have travelled to access abortion who have to then have the remains returned to them in a box or in the boot of a car. I can think of nothing more harrowing than experiencing that.

We can no longer pretend that women in Ireland cannot and are not accessing abortion. Instead, it is our job, as legislators and as representatives of the public, to deal with the realities facing our citizens. In an ideal world, abortion would not be necessary, and fatal foetal abnormalities, rape, and incest, in particular, would not happen and no woman would find herself in a position whereby she is required access to abortion for any reason. However, unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world. Whereas I understand the argument that some people put forward that the eighth amendment has saved lives, which to a certain extent I am sure is true, on the other side of the coin, the eighth amendment has caused uncertainty in many cases which, I am sure, may have cost lives. Sadly, with the eighth amendment in its current form, it appears there is no happy medium. We cannot legislate and we cannot regularise or prevent abortion, as it is happening every day. Many of the arguments for retaining the eighth amendment could easily be turned over in favour of its repeal.

Taking all these factors into account and examining all the circumstances and potential means of addressing the inadequacies of the current governance of abortion laws in our country, I cannot help but feel that the recommendations of the committee on the eighth amendment provide the best means by which to meet the medical needs of women in Ireland and to provide the best care for pregnant women in this country. I appeal to every person who wishes to engage with this debate and Bill to do so respectfully. Unfortunately, we have already seen elements on both sides reducing this debate to mud-slinging. In this House the debate has been very respectful throughout all the stages I have seen. The debate on the report of the committee was broadly respectful. To hope for this to continue with 4.6 million possible contributors to the discussion might be a tall order. I hope we will present facts rather than fiction or the ideal world scenario I spoke of.

Many people will have differing views, many on the basis of personal experiences and personal circumstances. By all means let us disagree but do not let us detract from the validity of every individual's experience or opinion. Fundamentally, this decision will be one made by the voting public. Let us allow both sides to put forward their arguments and inform the debate but let us do so in a respectful manner. In this campaign, it would be my view that once this debate takes hold on our televisions and on our radios, division and the proliferation of false information will likely dominate. Today we discussed the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica Facebook matter. We spoke earlier about the proliferation of false advertising and news, among other issues. I am absolutely certain this will dominate proceedings over the next number of weeks. I suggest to any person seeking further information to go to the referendum commission's website when it is established to get the facts. These will be without any particular colour. People should do this instead of relying on pop-up ads on computers or phones, or pamphlets and leaflets handed through the door. People should go to the referendum commission's website and verify the facts in hand. It is best piece of advice I could give anybody in this conversation.

Once the debate takes hold during the campaign, we must ensure we are able to filter the information provided to us. A great deal of moral superiority will adorn our newspapers. Yet again confusion will reign and the potential will be there for the debate to go off on a tangent rather than on the substance of what it is we are discussing. Let me contextualise what happens today and on a daily basis. Every year 3,500 women travel abroad and another 1,500 avail of illegal abortion pills. It is not that those who advocate to retain the eighth amendment are wrong. It is that our society deserves better than absolutism. Absolutism does not provide an option for proper health care in certain circumstances. It is those circumstances that I as a legislator have to consider.

If this House cannot legislate for a health care matter because a certain section of Irish society could not countenance availing of a termination, why must that section of society deny the rights of other women's bodily integrity to do what they please if it is appropriate? In the case of rape which results in pregnancy, do we as a society really believe that a woman violated by a man should be forced to carry a baby? Where is the compassion in that? There is then the fact that even if we inserted a constitutional amendment to allow for terminations in the case of rape or incest, the women involved would have to prove rape in under three months. Anyone who knows our legal system would acknowledge that simply is not possible.

I believe we are a compassionate society. We are the largest per capita donors to charity on the planet. We want to help those who do not have. We want to treat citizens who are in need with compassion and I want this State to treat its own women in crisis pregnancies with compassion.

In closing, I thank my colleagues for listening to my contribution. I urge colleagues, whether or not they agree with my position with regard to Article 40.3.3° or the eighth amendment, to facilitate the passage of this Bill to allow the people of Ireland to cast their ballots on this matter and to utilise their rights as Irish citizens to decide whether the eighth amendment should be retained.

I urge all Irish citizens to check the electoral register. They can login to www.checktheregister.ie, go into their local authority area and ensure their name is on that register. If it is not, google an RFA2 form, download it, fill it out, get it signed and stamped in the local Garda station and bring it to the franchise section of the local authority to get registered because many people pick up a newspaper or listen to the radio and read or hear about the many tragic cases of circumstances where the women of this country have had to avail of abortions. They have been moved but they sit, await the referendum and then realise perhaps that it is a bit late. They do not get their polling card so they do not vote. I ask people to ensure that on this occasion, as so many did during the marriage equality referendum, that they actually come out and make sure that they vote and have their say on the Constitution. It is their Constitution. It is not the preserve, as I have said, of this House or indeed the Seanad. I believe we should all be given the opportunity to have our say on this matter after 30 years. I commend this Bill and I look forward to its speedy conclusion.";NULL
2352;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Mary Butler;Fianna Fáil;"
I welcome the opportunity to speak on one of the most important issues to come before this House since I became a Member of the 32nd Dáil. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution published its report on Wednesday, 20 December 2017. The committee's report reflected the majority position of its membership, with dissenting positions and voting records set out in the report. I was not a member of the committee. However, from the outset I engaged with the process by reading as many of the transcripts and by watching as many witnesses as I could and by reading both the majority and minority reports over Christmas. It was clear there was not a consensus in the committee.

On 29 January 2018 the Government approved the holding of a referendum on Article 40.3.3° before the end of May 2018, subject to the timely passage of a constitutional amendment Bill on the matter by the Houses of the Oireachtas. It will be a matter for the Irish people to consider and determine by way of referendum whether to amend the Constitution. Today, we are debating the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018. It is a short Bill. Probably for anybody not used to reading Bills, and I was not used to reading them up to two years ago, it is a little bit complicated on the first page:

An Act to amend the Constitution.

Whereas by virtue of Article 46 of the Constitution any provision of the Constitution may be amended in the manner provided by that Article.

We move on a couple of pages and it comes to the substantive issue. Part 2 of the Schedule to the Bill states, in English: ""3° Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy"". For anybody listening today or watching and wondering what will they be voting on in the referendum, that is exactly what they will be voting on: ""3° Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy"".

I would like to continue the respectful debate of this very emotional matter. It is a very emotional matter. Any modern democracy should be capable of debating this in a respectful way. I refer to trying to address genuine concerns while preserving the life of the unborn child. As a Fianna Fáil Deputy I will state my position. I am thankful I am in a party where I can express this and follow a vote of conscience. It is very important to me and I have been consumed by this topic for quite a while. I accept my position will differ from others - I accept that - but I hope others can accept my position because I have learned to accept other people's positions. We have managed to be very respectful to each so far.

I made my position clear before I ever entered the 32nd Dáil. The people of Waterford knew how I stood before I became a councillor and a Deputy. I want to continue to support the unborn child's place in the Constitution. I am against repealing the eighth amendment. I was on the record from the very start saying I support a referendum. We live in a democracy. People are entitled to a vote and a say on this. I do accept that it has been 35 years since people got the opportunity to vote. However, if what I was asked to vote on tomorrow or Thursday said quite clearly am I in favour of a referendum, ""yes"" or ""no"", I would be able to answer that question with ""yes"", I am in favour of a referendum.

However, if it is whether I am in favour of a referendum where provision may be made by law for the regulation of the termination of pregnancy, I will not be able to vote ""yes"" to that. I am probably a little bit premature saying it because the vote will probably be taken on a Wednesday or Thursday, but that is my clear position. The committee recommended that the law should be amended to permit termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to reason. I have grappled with the words ""provided it is availed of through a GP-led service delivered in a clinical context as determined by law and licensing practice in Ireland with a gestational limit of 12 weeks"" or three months. I keep going back to the phrase ""with no restriction as to reason"". I will be honest in saying that I cannot understand how anybody can propose, ""with no restriction as to reason"", to end a 12 week-old baby being carried by a mother. It really bothers me that the life of the unborn child is thought of so little that I could be 11 and a half weeks pregnant, go along to my GP, say I no longer wished to be pregnant, be asked why and I could say that I had no reason. I could say that I did not want to be pregnant, I no longer wished to carry that baby and, if this law is implemented and this referendum is passed, the doctor could turn around and hand me a box of abortion pills.

I could then go home and end the life of that 11 and a half week old baby which I am carrying. I just cannot understand the term ""with no restriction as to reason"" and how we have come to this.

This will go beyond the position in Britain where the Abortion Act 1967 still requires two doctors to form the opinion in good faith that an abortion is necessary to prevent a risk to the mental or physical health of the pregnant woman. We all know this law is applied in such a way as to provide abortion on demand with one in every five pregnancies in Britain ending in abortion. That is 200,000 abortions performed in Britain every year with stronger laws than were proposed by the Citizens' Assembly. Currently in Ireland, one in approximately every 15 pregnancies, unfortunately, ends in abortion. I was also struck when I discovered that three fifths of people in England who have an abortion will go on to have a second abortion. That really fails me.

I still feel a premature vote was taken by the committee on 18 October 2017 when it decided, not by a majority, that Article 40.3.3° should not be retained in full. I remember thinking that night that it was job done, pull down the shutters and close the curtains. The decision was made without hearing all the viewpoints or all the witnesses. Why would one do that on the third week of witnesses appearing before the committee? Why would the committee not wait to hear all sides of the story? I was concerned and saddened at that stage. There has been much criticism that the committee was biased. I have sat on many committees myself. It takes up much time and the majority of people who sit on committees do so in good faith. One has to be shown the relevant facts in both sides of an argument. When looking at the number of different witnesses who presented before the committee, there was a bias regarding the number of people who presented from a pro-life ethos as against a pro-choice ethos. I do not blame any of the members present. I chair a committee myself and one has to have a fair and balanced approach. I do not think that happened with this committee, however. We are not trying to put people in boxes. I feel, however, that the pro-life opportunity was not presented as well as it should have been at the committee at that stage.

During the committee's meetings, I was also struck by how often the committee used the word ""foetus"". I do not think I have ever heard a word used quite as often. I am lucky enough to have three children. My youngest is 12 years old. I often remember walking down the street when people would say, ""Congratulations Mary, you are expecting a baby."" I never heard anybody on any occasion tell me, ""Congratulations Mary, you are expecting a foetus."" It is so much easier when one is talking about a bunch of cells or a foetus. We have to be quite clear, however, that we are speaking about the life of the unborn child. Everything to be found in a fully grown person is formed in a baby at eight weeks in the womb. At 11 weeks, a baby in the womb has fingerprints and its fingernails appear. At 12 weeks, the baby's lips open and close, it turns its head and can leap around the womb. I am not a member of a pro-life group or the Iona Institute. I am a person who has formulated my own opinions. I stand proudly here tonight articulating them.

Another point which disappointed me about the committee was that the only option it gave for a crisis pregnancy was abortion. I watched many hours of its proceedings. There was no or very little discussion of the option of adoption or fostering. There was little thought given to perinatal hospices for babies born with life-limiting conditions. A mother contacted me recently. She told me, unfortunately, her baby had been diagnosed with a fatal foetal abnormality, or as I would call it a life-limiting condition. She and her husband decided they would have their baby. She told me she will never forget the nine months that her baby lived. She will never forget holding that baby. Now, she has little lock of hair, the keepsakes and the grave to visit. I realise life is not simple for everyone. As I stand here tonight, people might think I have simplistic view. There are many people listening to this debate who are suffering crisis pregnancies. However, there are options and we must examine them. Forgetting the life of the unborn child in this debate is one thing I cannot do. The unborn child needs a voice. I am happy to be the voice of that unborn child. I have listened to numerous hours of debate. I might not have always been in the Chamber but I have listened. Unfortunately, the unborn child is the term we are not hearing about all too often. There cannot be only one solution to a crisis pregnancy. It cannot be the case that the only solution offered to a crisis pregnancy is abortion. Where are the wraparound supports for the babies and their parents?

Some 25 legal abortions were carried out in Ireland in 2017 under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 where the life of the mother was put first. We are living in a society where the life of a mother who presents at hospital can be put first. It has been put first in those instances. We must talk about that as well. There are different options open to us. One is a system which protects life in all its forms, from conception to natural death, and stands squarely and strongly behind those with crisis pregnancies.

I have heard many people talk over recent months that they have come on journeys. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion on that. People have come on journeys and changed their positions. I firmly believe in the journey of conception to birth. I firmly believe in the nine-month journey that when a baby is conceived, the baby deserves the right to life. I know we do not live in an ideal society. However, I am not happy with this perception that if somebody rapes a woman, they might only get seven years in jail but the woman who procures an abortion could be liable to 14 years in jail. I am open to correction on this but I have checked it. I am not aware of any one person in Ireland who has ever been prosecuted in the courts for procuring an abortion or procuring abortion pills. There are no records there. I am afraid that argument does not stand up for me.

On disabilities, we are told we have to stick to the facts. The facts are very clear. Not one child with Down's syndrome has been born in Iceland or Denmark in the past five years. These facts are clear as daylight and are there for everybody to see. The facts are also clear that in England 90% of all children diagnosed with Down's syndrome do not live and only 10% are born. Those facts are there. People can talk about truths and not giving out misinformation. That information is quite clear.

I have a little cousin, 16, who has Amsterdam syndrome. She has never walked or talked in her life. She has been tube-fed since the day she was born. She is a joy to behold, a Cheann Comhairle. I fervently believe she is as entitled to her right to life and to the love of her mother, father and brother as any other baby in this world is entitled to the right to life.

We have to be compassionate when it comes to issues like this. Unfortunately, a society has developed in countries of the world where children with disabilities are not respected as much as they should be, and where a termination or abortion seems to be the only way forward. That is where my worry starts.

I read with interest the policy paper approved and published by the Government on 8 March 2018, Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy. I was glad to get the policy paper because it sets out a lot of things quite clearly. Straight away, it deals with termination of pregnancy on the grounds of a risk to health. What the committee proposed was up to 12 weeks in regard to rape and incest and in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. However, the policy paper states:

Policy 1: That termination of pregnancy on the grounds of a risk to the health (which would include risk to the life) of a pregnant woman would be provided for in the General Scheme.

Policy 2: That the General Scheme would make no distinction between a risk to the physical or mental health of a woman.

Policy 3: That two appropriate ... medical practitioners would be required to assess access to termination of pregnancy on the grounds of a risk to the health of a pregnant woman.

Therefore, we have already moved beyond what the committee had suggested. I am so afraid that what we are going to end up with in this country is what we have in England, which is abortion on demand. There is no point calling it anything other than that because it is abortion on demand, when there are 200,000 babies being aborted.

I did a little digging on different statistics because, at the end of the day, we want to get to the facts and get to the truth, and we do not want to be accused of putting forward false facts. When abortion was introduced in Portugal in 2007 the rate was 6.6% and within five years it was 17%. The only thing that tells me is that if abortion becomes available in this country, it will open the floodgates and, before we know it, we will have abortion on demand.

I want to set out the reason I will not be able to support this Bill when we decide on it on Wednesday or Thursday, and I want to reiterate the reason. I have no problem with people having their say. We live in a democracy and if the question that was put to us in the House was, ""Are you in favour of a referendum - ""Yes"" or ""No""?"", I would clearly vote for a referendum. However, when the text of the Bill states, ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy"", I am afraid I will not support that. Again, I would like to say I would never be in favour of stopping a beating heart.";NULL

I am glad to have these few moments to set out my views. I have been contacted on many occasions in the past few weeks by members of the media wanting to know what my views were with respect to the legislation we are now debating but I have refused to tell them until I expressed them here in the Chamber. It is a long time ago - in fact, it is 35 years ago - that I was the Chief Whip of the Government that dealt with the 1983 Bill. We went into government after Fianna Fáil left in November 1982. We accepted the wording that was given at that stage by the outgoing Government but when we went into government, we were advised by the then Attorney General that there were flaws in the wording. We took the advice and we amended the wording and proposed an alternative wording for the public. We were defeated comprehensively by 87 votes to 65 and, in fact, a number of our own Deputies crossed the floor and voted against us, as was their right.

It was a very controversial issue then and a very unpleasant period. All sorts of charges were made against those of us who were doing what we felt was the right thing to do, not promoting abortion in any way, but seeking to talk about the wording. However, it changed into a debate about whether a person was either for or against abortion, and if anyone was against the wording that had been previously published, they were regarded as being pro-abortion. Indeed, my poor late mother, who was a daily communicant and daily massgoer, suffered terribly in Dalkey and, in fact, I had a visit from the local curate. He told me she was taking stick from some of the regular churchgoers because her son was seen to be pro-abortion. That was the atmosphere we were dealing with at that time. I am pleased that we have now become more mature and we are able to discuss these issues in a mature fashion.

The fact is I will not be supporting the deletion of the wording from the Constitution. I will be voting ""No"" to the proposal to delete the wording, even though, at that time, we were seen as being pro-abortion. I honestly believe that the past 35 years - maybe we could call it maturity - have shown it is only right and proper that there are certain issues where it is not up to this House or the other House to decide alone on such important issues, and that they should be referred back to the people for their views. That is why, while I accept there are some who hold a different view from my own, and so be it, I am convinced this should be decided by the people. I am saying to the people to keep what we have. We should keep what we have because the right to life of the unborn is important.

I am fortunate enough to have five healthy children and 13 grandchildren. One only realises this having listened to the stories of other people who are not as fortunate as I have been. Indeed, I have a cousin who had, I think, three or four miscarriages and finally delivered a baby, but the baby only lasted a week and then was buried. She is happy that she produced a live baby and had the opportunity to bury that baby gracefully and respectfully. It is very hard for men, perhaps, to understand the passion and the desire that women have in regard to their own children and the production of children.

On this issue, however, I think it is far more important that we realise it is not a matter for 158 Deputies to make such an important decision and that we would recommend to the public the taking out of the wording from the Constitution. My strong advice to the public and to my supporters is to leave what is in the Constitution there. If people want to try to change it in the future, they should go back to the people. However, I do not think that it should come to this House, with the possibility that instead of 12 weeks, it will be stretched out to 16 weeks or 22 weeks. These are issues the public will not have control over.

I honestly believe this is a turning point.

I am saying all of this in a reasonable way in the context of the issue being debated. I hope that when the debate is finished, people will get on with their business and that the current wording will remain, but it will be up to the people after we have had our discussion and expressed our views. I call on my supporters to vote ""No"" and leave the wording in the Constitution.

I have only spoken a few words, as there is no need for a long debate. This is simply a matter of whether we believe it is up to the people to make these decisions or just to those of us who are fortunate enough to have been elected to the House. I see nothing wrong in holding a referendum if that is the wish of the people.

With those few words, I will hand over to my colleague.

2355;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Fergus O'Dowd;Fine Gael;"
I thank Deputy Seán Barrett. This is an important debate and I have listened with great respect to all of the different views that have been expressed by every Member of the House and those who spoke to us about this matter in our communities and constituencies. I agree fundamentally with a point made by my colleague, Deputy Seán Barrett, that it is the voice of the people that will be heard clearly and, I hope, decisively on the day. After weighing up the hearings in the Houses and the various arguments they will hear between now and then, I hope the people will reach a decision based on serious and timely reflection.

I will speak first as a parent. My wife and I have three children. Our first baby was born through an non-elective caesarean, in other words, my wife had to have a caesarean. The subsequent two children were also born through an elective caesarean because she no longer had a choice in the matter. After our third child, the doctor advised us that medically she should not have more children. Thankfully, there was no subsequent pregnancy, but if there had been, what would we or, rather, what would she have done? This is the sort of issue that must address and with which I am dealing right now.

What if a woman with a serious heart condition has an unwanted pregnancy? She might not die as a result of having the baby, but her health could be seriously compromised. What if she has other serious medical conditions? That is an important issue for us to consider. In cases in which significant medical problems arise what can the mother do and what will we in Ireland do? A Deputy mentioned what was available in England, but what we have in England are thousands of Irish women, many of whom are in the category I am discussing, who have travelled there to have an abortion for medical or other reasons. We cannot deny the fact that many Irish women go there because they have serious medical conditions and that, if they have their babies, it will compromise their health which could lead to long-term, life-threatening outcomes. In every pregnancy there are two beating hearts, the mother's and the child's. Those who decide they need to have an abortion must have serious reasons for so doing. A medical condition that may be life threatening is one such reason. I would support and trust a mother in that position.

The other issues that arise are cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality. Where a woman has been raped or incest occurs, I cannot think of a more appalling or evil act, apart from murder. I would support a woman who has been raped or subjected to incest and is now pregnant in her decision to terminate the pregnancy. Such decisions would not be made lightly or on a whim. Even if the woman could ever talk about the evil things done to her, it would not be for a significant time. I understand part of the reason for having a 12-week period within which it is proposed a termination may take place is one cannot interrogate a mother about whether she was raped, make her prove that she was raped and make her say who, what, where and why. It will not happen. Even if a woman has been raped, it can often take more than a year for the case to come to court.

Incest, a most foul and evil act, often happens to younger women of perhaps 12, 13 or 14 years. In a such case one would not interrogate the mother within the three month period either. It is a long time and there is no denying the foetus has a beating heart at three months, but I would trust the woman and support her if she decided to have a termination.

Apart from the mothers who travel to England, each year thousands of Irish women import what is called the abortion pill which they purchase on the Internet. That is illegal, but it cannot be stopped because it is widely available. If a mother takes the abortion pill and experiences serious medical difficulties, to whom can she go, whom can she trust and what doctor can she ring? She cannot ring anyone. If she rings her doctor, it is illegal for him or her to advise her on the issue.

We must recognise what is happening and deal with it. Abortions should be rare and always safe. They should only happen if there is no other choice. In cases involving rape, incest, fatal foetal abnormalities or serious medical conditions, if the mother so decides, I trust and support her in making that decision. What we need, as legislators, is a recognition of the facts. I have spoken as a parent and a Member of Parliament and believe it is wrong that thousands of Irish women, having given significant thought to their concerns, have to travel to the United Kingdom each year. We should facilitate them in this country and that is what the legislation is about.

I accept the points made about counselling, as it is important that it be made available at every stage to a mother who wishes to think, talk, listen and learn about all of the options available to her. It is important that it be non-directive. I also support the committee's recommendations on sex and relationships education and a range of people's other needs that are not being dealt with fully in our society as constituted. I have listened to the medical opinions of eminent doctors. I accept that people hold the genuine belief the Houses in their hearings were not presented to by those whom they would have liked to have been asked to attend; therefore, let us hear them in the debate which will take place in the next few months. I will be happy to attend any meeting to listen to any argument and everyone because it is only by opening up our minds to every possibility on all sides of the argument that the people will make the right decision.

For me, it ultimately comes down to understanding and sympathising and empathising with the difficulties the women in question face in society.

They are faced with no choice but the boat to England and a cold place where they know nobody to go through a procedure that is extremely difficult even when one is in a homely and friendly atmosphere with people one knows and where people are supportive. If a woman is taking that pill in her house in Ireland tonight, I want her to be able to pick up the telephone, telephone the hospital, doctor or whoever she wishes to telephone, and for the advice to be available within the law of the country notwithstanding the difficulties she has had in making the decision to take that pill or to go to England. Ultimately, we are a compassionate country and we are a compassionate and caring people. We respect people who make that very difficult choice. The timeline we are proposing will allow time to reflect on it.

I respect everybody in the House. I respect the caring society we have. I do not believe what is happening is right or acceptable. It has to change and I believe the changes are proportionate, well thought out and are backed up by medical evidence. They recognise the very difficult position mothers are in and will continue to be in. Even if the eighth amendment stays, there probably will not be another referendum for many years. Mothers who make this decision will still decide to go to England and they will still take the pill without proper legal medical advice. That is unacceptable.";NULL
2356;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Bobby Aylward;Fianna Fáil;"
I am very happy to have the opportunity to state my position on the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 in the Dáil. I previously spoke in the House on this very important issue in late January. I will not repeat myself at length but I will reiterate an important point I made in my speech that evening. I have always believed in standing by my principles and that speaking from the heart will never send me too far wrong. That is how I have consistently approached this issue. As I previously stated, I have put politics aside on many occasions in the past and reflected honestly on the issue. Following periods of such reflection, I have always come to the same conclusion; I am a pro-life person and a pro-life politician. Despite agreeing with much of what the Minister said in his speech on the Bill on 9 March, my position remains the same. If we remove the eighth amendment of the Constitution, we will relinquish all protection of the unborn in the Constitution for good. We often speak in the House about vulnerable groups of people in society and the unborn are surely the most vulnerable of all such groups. They are unable to speak for themselves and rely solely on this amendment to the Constitution for their only protection. It remains their only protection. If the result of the referendum removes this protection, the fate of the unborn will be placed in the hands of legislators. I must keep an eye on the future in this regard. Future Governments with a strong majority, whether they lean hard to the left or hard to the right, could make further legislative change which the people of Ireland may have no control over. That is important. The people have to think about that before they vote at the end of May. If they give away the protection the unborn have at the moment, they must consider that they will never again have a say in legislation to protect the unborn. That is very important. The only way they could get it back is if a future Government, whether of the left or right, went back to the people again for a referendum. It is very unlikely that would happen. People have to think long and hard before they make this decision.

I welcome the Minister's commitment to ensuring that all women accessing maternity services should receive the same standards of safe, high quality care. I will outline some of the recommendations in the Minister's speech that I welcome. I agree with the Minister, Deputy Harris, that every woman from every corner of Ireland should expect and be able to access the maternity services she needs. I am glad the Minister is prioritising the improvement of the quality and safety of maternity care, the development of community midwifery teams and increasing access to anomaly scans. I welcome the commitment from Government to build capacity in our ultrasound service and the additional funding that has been promised to the national women and infants health programme to develop a more equitable and consistent antenatal screening service. The development of the national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and the establishment of bereavement teams on all maternity units is very welcome. As a husband, father, grandfather and uncle, I am acutely aware of the importance of women's health. Despite my views, I am on the record of the Dáil stating that if the appropriate medical personnel conclude the mother's life is at risk, if they conclude beyond medical doubt that the foetus will not survive and both parents are in agreement, then as a last resort abortion should be considered if deemed medically necessary.

I agree this must be put to the people. If it is being put, I would prefer some wording to be included that would protect the life of the unborn. It is very important. I agree that fatal foetal abnormality, rape and incest are very important issues. They are very crude and we do not know why they happen. I accept that some amendment could be made to the legislation, such as exists at the moment, to provide for circumstances such as a threat to the life of the mother or suicide. We can include other amendments. A repeal of the eighth amendment with no protection for the unborn is a step too far. I am asking the people of Ireland when they make the decision to think long and hard before they give away that right. I may be condemning myself as a legislator because we may not be able to handle it here. People must realise that if they vote for the removal of the eighth amendment without other legislation being put in place they will never again have a say in the protection of the unborn in this country. I ask them to think long and hard before they make that decision.";NULL
2357;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Eamon Scanlon;Fianna Fáil;"
There is no doubt that this is a defining moment in our country. The eighth amendment has had a hugely positive, humane and life-saving impact on Ireland. The debate on abortion is exclusively focused on removing the right to life of unborn babies while continuing to ignore all the amazing stories of the thousands of lives saved by the eighth amendment. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has said that pro-life advocates are cold, uncaring and neglectful for fighting to protect unborn babies' right to life in the Constitution. Voters need to understand that Ireland could become one of the most extreme pro-abortion countries in the world if the eighth amendment is overturned. One undeniable lesson from the Oireachtas committee is that once a society accepts that one unborn baby's life is undeserving of legal protection, it effectively means that no unborn baby's life has any value. No matter how it is dressed up, repeal will mean that for the first time in history a modern society would be removing a basic human rights protection from its constitution. What will be decided in the coming months will have huge implications for our society for a long time into the future. Thousands of people will be personally affected in their lives, welfare and happiness by what is decided. It is a tragedy that any woman has to go abroad for abortion. It is even more tragic when they go for abortion without getting the practical gesture of friendship or support that might lead them to make a different decision. It is wrong that the joint Oireachtas committee and now the Government have failed to acknowledge the obvious, which is that thousands of lives appear to have been saved by the eighth amendment. Britain allows abortion and one in five pregnancies there results in abortion. In Ireland, which does not allow abortion, one in 19 pregnancies ends in abortion. What are the reasons for this difference if not the difference in our laws? In 1983, the Irish people voted to recognise the rights of unborn babies and their mothers. It was a resounding victory for human rights. Should we now ask them to exclude some members of society from the enjoyment of that human right? There is another problem with asking people to repeal the eighth amendment. The political class is asking us to trust it and give it complete power to decide how much abortion will be in the country. As a political class, can we be completely trusted on this issue? I do not think so. Everybody in the House has the right to be here. They have been put here by the people. They have the right to express their concerns and views. I respect their views and I expect everybody else to respect mine. I feel that certain aspects of the amendment referendum debate has thus far been neglected by politicians and the media.

No informed vote can be taken without advance knowledge of the legal consequences of the approval of the proposed change. Clarity, from the Government and all who campaign for approval, is the essential factor.

I am pro-life because it is evident to me that an unborn child is a human life and one should be as careful as possible to protect that life. I accept that some of the electorate favour some changes to the current position but I believe that the recommendation for unrestricted access to abortion up to 12 weeks does not reflect public opinion. If Article 43.3.3° is repealed it is inevitable that legislators in the future will not stop at the 12 week threshold but will extend it. In a recent a Supreme Court ruling, seven judges unanimously decided that the only right the unborn baby had was the right to life. It is ironic that we are debating taking away this right to life today.";NULL
2358;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Dara Calleary;Fianna Fáil;"
I am happy to support the legislation on the holding of a referendum and it is important that a referendum commission is given the chance to prepare the necessary information. However, what we are being asked to do here is too big a leap for me. Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the only right the unborn had in the Constitution is the right to life but now that it has been stated by the Supreme Court, we are moving to take it away. That right to life will be replaced by a line to be inserted in Bunreacht na hÉireann conferring responsibility on this House to ""provide by law for the regulation of the termination of pregnancies"".

The associated legislation, which may be enacted if the referendum is passed, outlines the 12 week limit on terminations in many cases. I use the phrase ""may be enacted"" very deliberately because the sponsoring Minister cannot guarantee that he has the support of all his Government colleagues to pass the legislation, or that it will be a 12 week period. This is the heart of the issue. The certainty of protection for the unborn child and the mother in Bunreacht na hÉireann will be replaced by the uncertainty of subjecting it, or a future House, to the art of political negotiation which, by its nature, is uncertain and Byzantine. It can often depend on the make-up of a Dáil, which can change from election to election. I firmly believe the right of an unborn child or its mother deserves more than that and more than just being an agenda item for political negotiation.

The committee did a lot of work on this issue and many of the criticisms of it are unfair. Its members took on a job which many of us passed to them and its staff are the most experienced staff in this House. They should be exempt from the criticism that has been thrown at them. They made some interesting recommendations and I welcome the Minister's commitment in the form of the recruitment of extra gynaecology and obstetric consultants, of which we need 100. There is a recognition in the report of the difficulties in recruiting them but they are difficulties associated with issues around HR and pay, which the Minister can address. We also need the roll-out of perinatal mental health services and I welcome the Minister's commitment to that too. It is necessary for the Minister to outline a timeline for these so that equal credence is given to those recommendations as to the other recommendations the Minister is following.

The debate on the report, and on this referendum motion, has been respectful so far and people have listened to other opinions, which I hope continues. I hope the referendum commission will ensure it continues by providing the necessary information. At the heart of this debate are women and their unborn children and this needs to be remembered over the course of the debate in the coming months. Whatever the result, the Government must respect it, regardless of what some Ministers have stated over the past week.";NULL

I have listened intently over recent months as this item was discussed at the Oireachtas committee, where many people made passionate contributions and professionals and families gave very competent evidence. What is before us is a proposal to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution and to allow the Oireachtas to legislate further.

I have given it a huge amount of thought, as many people have. The eighth amendment was put into the Constitution in 1983 and it has, by and large, served us well. I believe it should not be repealed and that, if there is an attempt to repeal it, the alternatives should be put to the Irish people. It is not acceptable as it is a fundamental life-and-death issue on which the Irish people should be sovereign. In any decision made on repealing or replacing the eighth amendment, it is not acceptable to repeal it and allow the Oireachtas, or future Houses of the Oireachtas, to legislate. The Irish people should be consulted at all times on what should be in Bunreacht na hÉireann as regards the right to life of the unborn. I have listened to the very serious situations in which families have found themselves and the enormous challenges they face but it is not acceptable to allow an Oireachtas, whatever its make-up, to decide. Many people debating this 35 years ago would not have envisaged the type of Oireachtas we have today and who is to say what an Oireachtas of the future will be like? It could be ultraliberal or ultraconservative but God alone knows.

I am standing by what is in the Constitution and it should not be repealed. No Oireachtas should be allowed to make a decision as fundamental as the one we are about to make. Many people at the extremes of the debate have had their say but I believe, from listening to people in my own area and across the country, that people are very personal about this issue. They will make their own minds up absolutely personally, and that is the right way to do it. As Oireachtas Members, we have to give our view but the people are educating themselves on the evidence. They want protection in the Irish Constitution and we have taken pride in a Constitution that respects every single person. The unborn should be included in that and under no circumstances could we repeal the eighth amendment to allow an Oireachtas, now or in the future, to decide. That is why I will be voting to retain the eighth amendment.";NULL

I am sharing time with Deputies Quinlivan, Tóibín and Munster.

Dr. Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, stated it was clear that the eighth amendment did not protect the best interests of mothers or babies. Obviously, we need to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution, but I do not think we can underestimate the job of work we have ahead of us in order to do this.

I welcome the chance to speak about this issue again. I spoke about it a number of weeks ago, but I always welcome any opportunity we have to raise the issue of repealing the eighth amendment. Whenever I speak about the issue, I always refer to three things - trust, choice and respect. We have to trust women to make choices about their lives and bodies and need to respect the choices they make. For me, it is as simple as that.

I take the opportunity to appeal to those who are genuinely conflicted on whether they are in favour of repeal. Many have very strong views on the issue, some of whom are in my family and among my friends. I strongly appeal to them to look back at the hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and the factual medical evidence presented at it. I do not think the issue should be debated on social media, including Facebook. People need to inform themselves of the facts of the issue. I also appeal to people to put themselves in the shoes of women who are facing crisis pregnancies. Imagine if it was you or your wife, daughter or sister or a close friend. How would you feel about the matter then? The reality is that every day 12 women or girls in this country have an abortion, nine of whom travel to England, while at least three that we know of - these are just the statistics of which we know - risk their health and a 14-year prison sentence by taking illegal abortion pills ordered online with no medical advice or supervision.

We cannot ignore this issue any longer; we cannot pretend it is not happening, but, most importantly, we cannot continue to ignore women and their health needs any longer. That is why we need to hold the referendum on the thirty-sixth amendment of the Constitution and repeal the eighth amendment. I again appeal to Members of this House who are supportive of repealing the eighth amendment on the job of work we must do to get out there to ensure that it is the facts of the matter that people will discuss, not some of the nonsense we have seen on social media from some on the other side of the campaign.";NULL
2363;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Maurice Quinlivan;Sinn Féin;"
I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018. I am strongly in favour of repeal of the eighth amendment. I recently met our local group in Limerick, Repeal LK, of which I have become a member. I look forward to working with it and other elected representatives in Limerick to campaign to ensure the eighth amendment is removed from the Constitution. The amendment should never have been inserted into the Constitution in 1983. It has imposed untold misery on thousands of women who have had to travel abroad for a termination. It has denied women the right to receive the best health care to meet their individual needs and tied the hands of medical professionals here. Women who were the victims of rape were abandoned by the country in their time of most need and forced to catch a flight to seek treatment elsewhere. The amendment has resulted in women buying abortion pills online and taking them in their homes with no medical advice or supervision, with the physical and psychological impact it brings. Unfortunately, the situation the amendment has created in the State has resulted in the deaths of women. Abortions are happening in Ireland and the eighth amendment has never changed this. All it has done is export an issue with which we refused to deal and force women and girls to take abortion pills on their own with no medical advice or assistance. As a society, we can no longer continue to keep our heads in the sand and pretend that we live in some utopian society that is not affected by the issue. It has taken far too long for it to come back for public vote and now is the time for change. I hope the generations of people, including me, who have never had a say on the eighth amendment will take the opportunity to ensure we will vote for change and ensure the outdated status quo will not be maintained.

The issue is clearly divisive and both sides of the debate hold strong beliefs on the matter. However, whatever one's view or persuasion, one thing for sure is that citizens of the country deserve to have a vote on the issue. That is without question. We live in a democracy and a massive section of society has never had an opportunity to vote on the issue, one which has very wide-ranging consequences in a variety of situations. Regardless of one's personal opinion on the subject, it would be unconscionable to try to block the citizens of Ireland from having a say on the issue in a referendum.

Anyone who listened to the tragic story of ""Ciara"" on ""Morning Ireland"" today would have been absolutely heartbroken. She and her husband received the devastating news that their much-wanted child would be incompatible with life outside the womb. They were informed that, owing to the additional threats to her health, the treatment was the immediate evacuation of the foetus. She then asked her doctors why it could not happen immediately and was informed that, despite the threat to her health, nothing could be done for her in this state owing to the eighth amendment. The devastating news that her child would be incompatible with life outside the womb was compounded by being forced to travel to Liverpool for treatment. She vividly described tragic scenarios about the journey such as regretting not being able to have her mother with her and the harrowing ordeal of a ten-hour journey home by boat carrying her baby in a coffin and trying to keep her baby cold with ice packs. As they exited the port, the customs officer looked at them and the small white coffin and waved them through as they had seen it too many times. It was devastating to hear her story. It makes one think of all of the other women and their untold stories who have had to suffer this terrible ordeal.

The eighth amendment needs to go. We need to trust women. I will be campaigning for the repeal of the eighth amendment and hope we can have a respectful and constructive debate on the issue. I commend everybody who took part in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. They were impressive and excellent and their contributions were really good. I echo Deputy Kathleen Funchion's comment that people should try to read some of the transcripts of the debates at the committee. I learned an awful lot. I thought I was educated on the issue until I started to watch the proceedings of the committee. I encourage people to watch them. They should not read the fake news on social media, including Twitter, but the expert advice given to the committee by Ireland's leading medical professionals and trust women on the issue.";NULL
2364;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Peadar Tóibín;Aontú;"Sinn Féin believes the eighth amendment should be repealed and that abortion services should be made available in certain cases such as where there is a life-limiting disability, in cases of rape and incest and where there is a threat to the health of the mother. I thank my party for giving me the opportunity to speak to the Bill, despite the fact that I hold a different view from that of my party. Respectful debate on the issue is a threat to nobody and should be encouraged. I believe strongly that we need to fight for every single living human being and that our yardstick is that no mother or child should be left behind by the State. Fine Gael is not a good place in which to be if one is a young mother or a child. The feminisation of poverty accelerated under Fine Gael austerity Governments in the past few years. Tonight 3,267 children sleep in emergency accommodation; dozens of children lie on trolleys daily in overcrowded hospitals; 52,257 children are on hospital waiting lists, while 8,500 children are waiting to see medical specialists. What does this say about a particular Government that at a time when hundreds of thousands of children are living in crisis among us, the next seven months of its time will be consumed by deleting the right to life of the unborn child?

The Taoiseach states he is pro-choice, but he ignores the fact that he has created the economic circumstances that lead so many women to believe they do not have a choice. I believe that if he is actually pro-choice, he should lift families out of poverty; fund child care, housing and health care services; and provide a decent living wage for women in order that they will believe they have a future and that there is hope and a choice for them.

In the Sunday newspapers the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, stated she had been ignorant when she was pro-life. If she was ignorant, that was her responsibility because no elected representative should come into this Chamber and speak on the issue unless he or she has carried out research and listened to the people on both sides of the debate. She has also stated a ""No"" vote might not be expected. What kind of a slap in the face to the democratic process is it when a Minister alludes to the holding of a second referendum before the date of the first one has been selected?

The right to life is one of the most fundamental rights there is. It is probably one of the most defining values any of us on both sides of the debate recognises. Typically, it is not something that changes among people with radical speed. A number of months ago the debate was focused on the most difficult situations in people's lives.

It focused on life-limiting disability, and children conceived in rape and incest. That is not where the debate is at anymore. In a few months the debate has been radically transformed into a debate about whether we should have abortion on request in this State. The debate on repeal is currently a debate on abortion on request with no restriction for the first 12 weeks of the child's existence. At 12 weeks it is about the time when mothers and fathers get to see the child for the first time at the 12-week scan. Most families will have in their homes photographs of their 12-week gestational child. What is being discussed is a regime that will go much further than the people in the country will accept.

Another element is not being discussed. The Minister's policy document does not seem to mention any gestational limit for certain children, maybe children with life-limiting conditions. The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has recently objected to foetal fatal impairments being used as a specific ground for abortion. The committee maintained that there was no guarantee as to whether a foetal abnormality was fatal. It stated:

Even if the condition is considered fatal, there is still a decision made on the basis of impairment. Often it cannot be said if an impairment is fatal. Experience shows that assessments on impairment conditions are often false.

The debate has moved on with surprising rapidity recently, which has taken people by surprise. Some people have told me that it feels like a blank cheque. Two years ago the Taoiseach, then a Minister, alluded to the fact that if we delete the eighth amendment from the Constitution, we would literally leave every single decision in the hands of governments which individuals may or may not have voted for. He said that the Dáil could legislate even for third-trimester terminations. He said that as if it was shocking and yet the Minister's policy document does not give a gestational limit for children with life-limiting conditions.

In his opening speech on the debate, the Minister referred to Miss C. The Minister has wronged Miss C in this situation because she specifically asked that her case would not be used as an advertisement for abortion. Her experience highlights a taboo issue that is not being discussed, which is the damage that abortion can do to mothers as well. Miss C was brutally raped when she was 13 years old and she was taken by the HSE to England for an abortion. In the days before her abortion she said she was drugged to the eyeballs in her own room. The staff held her down and injected her with drugs. Her parents took a legal action to try to prevent the abortion, but they failed. A few years ago Gemma O'Doherty published an interview with her, in which she said:

It only really hits you after you have children. You never forget your missing baby. It plays on your mind every day. Any woman who has an abortion and then goes on to become a mother will know all about it...

Due to the Supreme Court judgment, no further protection for an unborn child is left in the Constitution apart from the eighth amendment. The only thing that stands now to protect unborn children in the Constitution is the vote of the Irish people.

One of the major difficulties I have with abortion is the effect it has on people on low incomes. In the United States, people on low incomes or below the poverty line are much more likely to have abortions. In New York city, for example, more black children were aborted than came to term. That is in a city that cries that black lives matter there.

When a law changes, it affects the culture and society in ways that we cannot even imagine. The culture change is not by design but by default. We do not want to become a country that counts chromosomes like other countries do.

Also invisible in this whole debate is the issue of gender-selection abortion, with which I have major difficulties. Estimates by Nobel Prize-winning professors have stated that about 100 million are currently missing from the world due to either gender-selection abortion or infanticide. I do not see anything in the Minister's policy document that could prevent that happening in this country.

The life of the mother should be protected in every crisis bar none. This is a red line issue for me. Ireland has one of the lowest maternity mortality rates in the world - even lower than many countries where abortion is legal. In 2013 I attended the committee dealing with that particular legislation. I asked the masters of the maternity hospitals who were present if they knew of any situation where a mother's life was lost in this country due to the eighth amendment and they all said ""No"" to me.

This referendum will determine for 50 years hence who lives and who dies. What is at stake in the forthcoming referendum is the existence and the lives of tens of thousands of unborn children. Where there is life, there is hope. I am a firm believer that in the 21st century we have to have a society that looks to protect every single mother and child and leaves absolutely no one behind.";NULL
2365;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Imelda Munster;Sinn Féin;"
The eighth amendment of the Constitution has been a blight on the State for 35 years. Generations of young Irish women have suffered hurt, stress, anguish, poor health and even death because of it. The Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment have worked hard informing the debate and guiding Oireachtas Members regarding the facts of abortion and the options available to us to remedy the current untenable situation. It is proof of the importance of informed factual evidence-based discussion.

There have been many cases of women who have been wronged by the eighth amendment. There is the tragedy of thousands of women every year - 12 women every day - leaving the State and going abroad to access health care. It is already a very difficult situation to be in, facing a crisis pregnancy. Having to fundraise and make arrangements to travel abroad makes the situation much worse. Despite the safety valve of women travelling to England for those who are in a position to do that, or abortion tablets which women are forced to administer without medical supervision, tragedies still occur. This State ignores its duty to women and foreign health services have been picking up the slack for too long. Irish women should not have to rely on a foreign health service for medical care. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves.

In recent days we also heard that a 12 year old child travelled from Ireland to procure an abortion in Britain. A small child was forced to travel in order to have an abortion without local services or family support. In cases of incest or abused children, they might not be in a position to travel. Children like her are not protected under the current legislation. Forcing a 12 year old child to give birth is barbaric.

When I spoke in the Dáil earlier this year on the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee, I spoke about political responsibility and it remains an important point. We are legislators with the privilege of representing our constituents. We have a responsibility to see this through. The people deserve an opportunity to vote to repeal the eighth amendment and I hope they choose to repeal.";NULL
2366;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Brendan Howlin;Labour Party;"
I am sharing time with Deputy Kelly.

My party’s support for this proposal is well known. We supported it at the all-party committee and we support it today. I am pleased that on this truly important matter of social policy, the Labour Party will speak with one clear and unified voice.

I will address a number of the arguments I have seen made against the proposal, largely outside the House. However, let us also be honest. This is not a pro-choice amendment. That is not the type of the discussion that took place at the Citizens' Assembly or the Oireachtas committee.

It was an open, listening, inclusive debate, grappling with truly important issues.

The proposal before us, and I do not shy away from the fact that the 12 week recommendation is integral to the proposal, is what I would call a hard cases proposal. It arises from a widely held acceptance that the eighth amendment does not afford adequate protection to the lives and health of women, and that there are cases and instances where the termination of a pregnancy is the compassionate and right thing to do. I refer, of course, to the tragedy of fatal foetal abnormalities, pregnancy arising from rape and incest, and cases that impact upon the health of women. It is critical to recall that the reason the all-party committee achieved the level of agreement that it did is because, after detailed and careful consideration of the issue, it could see no practical way to address these issues without allowing for the recommendation that abortion be permitted up to 12 weeks' gestation. That proposal came about because it was and remains the only way of addressing these hard cases. Any other approach, for example, one which seeks to prove rape or incest, would be impossible and indeed unacceptable. Once again, policemen and lawyers would move in where doctors and medical practitioners should be the people assisting women at a time of distress.

I have respect for the Tánaiste. I do not doubt his own sincerity in struggling with this issue. It is instructive, however, that he has been unable to answer his own question about any alternative approach for dealing with those hard issues. I do not believe that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, who is present, or the leader of Fianna Fáil would have arrived at the positions they arrived at if there was a viable alternative approach. For this reason I reject the argument that politicians cannot be trusted with this issue and cannot be allowed to take this in a compassionate way. That was the spurious argument made in 1983. I believe the real position is the exact opposite. Politicians, no more than any other citizen, struggle with this issue and act in accordance with their consciences. If afforded the responsibility of legislating for this issue, I am confident that all the Members of these Houses will do so in accordance with their best beliefs, the balance of advice afforded to them by medical experts, and in the best interests, as we perceive it, of the people of this Republic.

I share the ambition of the Taoiseach that abortion should be safe, legal and rare. As the Minister responsible for the legislation liberalising the law on contraception 25 years ago, I welcome the proposal from the Minister for Health to expand access to contraception. I recognise too that abortion takes place in this country already. The abortion pill is perhaps the transformative medical disruption since the last referendum. It is a fact that cannot be ignored that many Irish people import abortion pills and take them in their own homes. That is illegal as the law now stands. Does any Member of this House seriously suggest that we now set about arresting, prosecuting and jailing all the women who have imported or taken these pills, or those who will take them tomorrow or the day after? Some extremists might favour that course of action. I honestly believe that most Irish people would recoil at the prospect.

It is not a choice between the perfect abortion-free world of the eighth amendment and a liberal abortion regime. That is a false dichotomy. The perfect world of the eighth amendment never existed. It was a cop-out, perhaps for many a well-intentioned cop-out, but a cop-out nonetheless. As such it prevents this nation from addressing this issue in the manner we might otherwise have done. Others, I am afraid, would like us to look away and pretend what is happening is not happening in Ireland. For them, there is no abortion here. That happens somewhere else and is not our responsibility. Our consciences are clear. The truth is that Irish women travel every day to the United Kingdom and elsewhere to avail of abortion facilities. We all know that to be the case. We passed a referendum to facilitate it. It happened before 1983 and has happened every day since.

Contrary to the suggestion of some, what the all-party Oireachtas committee proposed does not put Ireland among the cohort of the most liberal abortion regimes in Europe. That is simply not a fact. It puts us in the sensible mainstream, a point informed by our belated recognition of the challenges women face on an ongoing basis. I do not think it is an accident that we are discussing this issue now, when we have come to realise the manner in which we have respected and treated women historically in this land. I read last week of comments made by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, on the issue. I do not believe she intended to do this, but a clarification I think is required.

Whatever people feel about the outcome of this referendum, whether they are satisfied or not, I believe this referendum is a once in a generation opportunity to address this issue for a new generation. Were we to lose, for instance, those of us supporting this proposal, having made the argument that a new generation were entitled to have their say on this issue, would have to accept the outcome as resolved for the foreseeable future. I make this point so that we can avoid complacency on this issue. This is our opportunity to change an amendment that fulfilled the worst fears of those who opposed it and never fulfilled the dreams of those who supported it.

I conclude with remarks made by my former colleague and party leader, Dick Spring, speaking on the equivalent debate 35 years ago or so. Opposing the Bill, he said that if this clause is inserted in our Constitution then that document will enshrine an attitude to women which verges on contempt. Ireland was a very different place in 1983. The Ireland of 2018 has faced many problems and issues and has recognised the dark recesses of our past, particularly this nation's treatment of women. I believe that we must now face the issue of abortion as an issue for us to settle for our people, on our soil, with compassion, understanding and empathy.";NULL
2367;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Alan Kelly;Labour Party;"
For me, repealing the eighth amendment is about trusting women. It is also about trusting men. I might also say that it is about trusting the electorate and legislators. That is what we are here to do. We are all honoured to be elected as Members of these Houses and it is our job to deal with this issue which has been outstanding since 1983.

As I stated previously, I fully support the report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, the approach of the Government and what is being done by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris. He and I often criticise one another in the House, but he is doing quite well on this issue.

According to the 2016 census, 50.49% of the population are women whom I trust them. I support the repeal of the eighth amendment which should never have been inserted into the Constitution. It was a sign of different times when we did not trust the women or men of the country, nor the Chambers of the Oireachtas. The decision to allow for terminations up to 12 weeks is proportionate and correct, while the decisions not to allow for terminations up to 22 weeks or on socioeconomic grounds are also correct. I support the provisions outlined by the Minister in recent weeks in that regard.

There will be an opportunity to showcase new politics in the Chamber in the coming weeks. Many Members on either side of the argument have expressed themselves in a very fair manner. Those who are in favour of the proposed change have expressed themselves in a way that has shown the reality of the situation in which we find ourselves. However, although I oppose their point of view, I must admit that the majority of those who are against repeal have also expressed themselves in a fair way. While walking through my home town of Nenagh last week I met several people who were campaigning against the proposed amendment. I admire that they were campaigning and that they spoke to me in a civil manner, even though they knew my views on the issue. We need more of that type of approach and less of that typified by the 12 nasty and anonymous text messages I have received since last Saturday because of my political views on the issue.

We must ensure the Referendum Commission will monitor that the campaign is proceeding in a proportionate, fair and balanced manner and that the tactics being used are fair. That is particularly important, given what we have read and heard about campaigning on social media in the past 48 hours. This is probably virgin territory in terms of the impact of social media, the data available to many companies as a result and how they might be used in a referendum campaign on a social issue such as this. The position in that regard has changed since the marriage referendum and we must be very conscious of the unique capacity of social media.

The track record of the Labour Party on social issues is second to none among the major political parties. Some Members such as the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, have argued for some kind of halfway house on the issue and that issue must be addressed. I have spoken about those who are opposed to repeal, but a Member such as the Tánaiste who believes there is a middle ground or an alternative view must outline it in detail. I have not yet heard any detail in that regard. Such Members are being disingenuous. While I accept that Members may have different views on an issue such as this, they must outline that they are in favour of repeal but have a different view in terms of the proposed period of 12 weeks and then let us know what that the different view is and how it will give protection to women and clear guidance to medical professionals on how they can act. Such Members must not leave the situation as it is.

The situation where gardaí, barristers and other lawyers were debating various medical circumstances involving women was not acceptable or workable. What is being proposed is practical, humane, sensible and modern in how it would deal with the issue. The eighth amendment has been disintermediated by hundreds of thousands of women since 1983. They did so by leaving the country to have a termination, mostly in the United Kingdom. The most worrying aspect is that women are now circumventing the eighth amendment by illegally taking abortion pills. Unfortunately, we do not know what the consequence will be in the years and decades to come, which is deeply worrying and should be of concern to all Members, no matter on what side of the debate they are. We do not know the consequences or future impact of women taking such pills. The issue cannot be addressed by An Garda Síochána being empowered to arrest those who are taking abortion pills. Do we know what such women are taking or how the pills are administered? There is no medical supervision. Women, many of them young, are sitting alone in rooms and taking the pills without supervision, possibly not having spoken to many people, if anyone. I do not wish to be a legislator in a country where such situations are allowed to continue to occur. That is barbaric, insensitive and goes against all common decency.

As I have told the Minister, I will never forget bringing Amanda Mellett to meet him. He dealt with the issue very compassionately and I knew from that day that he would deal with this issue in the manner he has. I congratulate him and all those working with him in that regard. Ladies such as Amanda Mellett encouraged and will encourage me to play a very active part in the campaign.

My county and constituency are probably the second most conservative in referendums on social issues in the history of the State. However, legislators must lead, act in accordance with their conscience and stand up for their beliefs. Everybody should support the will of the people and let them make the decision on this issue. My party and I will work in the coming months with those across all political divides who are in favour of holding and, it is to be hoped, passing the referendum.";NULL
2368;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Paul Murphy;People Before Profit-Solidarity;"Anti-choice billboards carry the slogan ""One of us"". On the billboards with pictures of foetuses there is something or, more precisely, someone obviously missing: the person who can become pregnant. The absence of women betrays the real viewpoint of the most reactionary and right-wing anti-choice campaigners. In their world view women - pregnant women in particular - are not one of us but, rather, merely vessels for foetuses. The referendum is an opportunity to say pregnant and other women are one of us.

They should not have a constitutional provision interfering with their health care or denying their bodily autonomy. Sheila Hodgers, whose cancer medication was stopped when she became pregnant and who was denied a caesarean section for the same reason, died yesterday 35 years ago as a result. She was one of us. Savita Halappanavar was one of us. Miss X was one of us. Miss P was one of us. Countless women, with letters and names, were treated horrifically and their health and lives were endangered as a consequence of the odious eighth amendment. They were and all are one of us. The 170,000 women who have been forced to travel to access abortion - they are all one of us. We have a unique opportunity to right an historic wrong by removing that barbaric provision from the Constitution.

Across the country, in pro-choice groupings such as in Tallaght tonight, in colleges, schools and workplaces people are discussing how we can win, how we can seize the opportunity. I think it is worth looking back at the historic victory for marriage equality. In a country where, let us remember, homosexuality was criminalised until 1993, we won a ""Yes"" vote of 62%, with the highest turnout for a referendum since the divorce referendum in 1995. That transformation happened because of a social movement, bigger and bigger Pride parades and thousands demonstrating for marriage equality. In the run up to the referendum, let us remember how the ""Yes"" badges were ubiquitous. People were consciously making a statement that they supported marriage equality. Activists turned out and had conversations on doorsteps, in homes and in workplaces. They explained the need for equality and challenged prejudice. Young people, women and working class communities led the way in terms of ""Yes"" votes. The youth mobilisation was seen in the #HomeToVote phenomenon and in the 66,000 mostly young people who added their names to the supplementary electoral register in order to vote. Young people turned out overwhelmingly to vote. In Fingal, for example, 96% of newly registered voters came out to vote. Working class areas came out to vote ""Yes"". In Coolock the turnout was 88%. In the Liberties it was 88%. In Cherry Orchard it was 90%. It was 70% in Moyross and 72% in South Hill. In Jobstown it was 87%.

What are the lessons of that victory now? The first is that the conservative ""silent majority"" is a myth. The source of the conservative nature of the State is not to be found in the attitudes of ordinary people, but rather in the backward nature of a capitalist political establishment which has historically rested on the church as a means of social control. The second is that the force required to achieve change and to win the kind of progressive society based on equality that the majority of people want is a movement of people from below. The same lessons are also present from the struggle that has got us this far towards repealing the eighth amendment. The reason we have a referendum is because of a groundswell of public opinion against the current repressive backward abortion regime. This was driven by an active movement from below when people came out onto the streets after the death of Savita Halappanavar five years ago to say ""never again"". Tens of thousands demonstrated in protests that grew year on year. Just like the ""Yes"" badges, the ""repeal"" symbol is all around - on bags, jumpers and badges. Two weeks ago, on International Women's Day in Dublin, one could see just how young, radical and active the movement is. It is part of a global movement led by young people and women for equality, freedom and choice. We saw on the same day the same movement mobilised 6 million people to demonstrate as part of a feminist strike in Spain. It is that grassroots movement which got us this far and it is that movement which will win the referendum campaign too.

We know we have to be prepared for a campaign of misinformation and lies. We caught a glimpse of that in recent weeks with the case of Noel Pattern whom the Save the 8th group claimed was a psychiatric nurse who was present during abortions. He turned out not to be a nurse at all. He admitted altering the document which he claimed was his nursing qualification. The hospital in which he claimed to work - passing instruments to surgeons between 2001 and 2005 - said he only worked in it for eight months in 2000 in a portering role. In the end, John McGurk, the campaign spokesperson, was only able to claim that ""it cannot be disproved that Mr. Pattern was never present during an abortion."" That is a long way from the claims on his video that he saw foetuses left on shelves for four or five days. Tribute must be paid to those on Twitter and the journalists who exposed the truth about Noel Pattern. The same approach, unfortunately, will be required again and again in the coming months.

I wish to address some of the points made in the debate so far by Deputies who spoke against repeal of the eighth amendment. Deputy Mattie McGrath made a big play for this debate being rushed. He should tell that to the 170,000 women forced to travel since 1983. The amendment has been in the Constitution for 35 years. In recent years there have been two repeal Bills and two fatal foetal abnormality Bills. Those who can become pregnant today did not have the right to vote in 1983. Entire generations of women have had no say on the issue and now they have to be listened to and they cannot be told that attempting to listen or giving them the right to have a say is rushing things. Deputy Fitzpatrick called on us to consider adoption as a ""life-saving alternative to abortion"", as did Deputy Butler. However, they failed to mention what must happen before adoption. They are talking about forcing a woman to go through pregnancy, followed by a forced birth, followed by adoption. Their alternative literally means using women as vessels, as in The Handmaid’s Tale.

Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe declared that access to abortion pills online ""is a manifestation of global interference in our society."" Does he believe that women being able to travel to access abortions in Britain or the Netherlands is similarly a manifestation of global interference? Is he in favour of preventing women from travelling so that Catholic Ireland can be saved from so-called global interference? I hate to break it to the Deputy, but abortion existed long before the Internet. He also admitted that he ""did not read the reports of the Citizens' Assembly or of the joint committee entirely"", which did not stop him opposing their recommendations. What he, Deputy Tóibín, and all of those opposed to repeal have emphasised is the proposal for access to abortion up to 12 weeks on request. Given that Deputy O'Keeffe did not bother to read the reports, I will summarise some of the key evidence which was given and which he can read in the transcripts, which led to the recommendation by the Oireachtas committee for abortion to be available up to 12 weeks. Fundamental to that is the point that the Citizens' Assembly recommended 12 weeks on request after being presented with the facts. Those facts include that 12 weeks is the basis of most abortion laws around the world, including across Europe; that pills and abortion before 12 weeks cover 92% of abortions; and that 15% of people go past the 12 weeks currently because they have difficulty in making arrangements for travel because of financial difficulties, child care and work, among other issues. That delay would be eliminated by legislation providing for abortion up to 12 weeks on request. Additional facts include that the abortion pill is perfectly safe, as highlighted by the World Health Organization; the increasing number of people using the pills regardless of the law and the problem of the criminalisation of people using pills given that it acts as a deterrent to people seeking aftercare if needed; and the difficulty in legislating only for rape and incest, as it would require some form of proof.

Just as the Citizens' Assembly proposed to make provision for abortion up to 12 weeks after hearing all the evidence, we should be confident that the public will support 12 weeks on request if people hear all the evidence. We have to explain upfront and clearly why legislation that will make a tangible difference to women and pregnant people in Ireland is crucial. I think we can be confident that a significant majority can be convinced of the need for abortion access which provides for the 92% of women who make the decision. A crucial part of that is explaining the multiple reasons women need to access abortion services. Those reasons are made very real and personal by the excellent Facebook page, ""In Her Shoes - Women of the Eighth"", which should be required reading for those campaigning to maintain the eighth amendment so that they can see the consequences. I will outline one example:

I was in an abusive relationship, I had a two year old daughter, struggling to make a life for her and I.

I had summoned the courage to make him leave.

I found out I was pregnant.

I was scared at what kind of life my daughter and I would have, and the new baby, as a mother on my own...

I decided the best option for all of us was my baby inside would be better off in spirit than with us. That I could give my two year old daughter a better life with just two of us.

I had to ask my family for money to travel to the UK.

She further states:

Myself and my mam took the plane to Liverpool. Flights were extortionate, money we didn't have.

Feeling rotten when I had to go to work the next day and pretend I was ""normal"" with cramps in my tummy, antibiotics that the clinic had given me ""just in case"" making me sick, and being afraid to approach my GP for medical care because I felt ashamed for making the best possible decision as a mother in my head for my daughter and I.

That woman is one of us too. We need to repeal the eighth amendment.";NULL
2369;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Richard Boyd Barrett;People Before Profit-Solidarity;"Solidarity-People Before Profit is a pro-choice party and therefore we are for removing the eighth amendment from the Constitution and support this legislation to allow the people make a decision on whether they wish to remove the eighth amendment.

Whatever about our views on this issue, it is important, certainly from my experience already canvassing, to remind people of the question they will be asked as a result of this legislation passing and a referendum taking place because many people who do not follow all the detail of what goes on in this House are not quite sure. I do not want in any sense to duck the issue of the 12 weeks and the important discussions that were had at the all-party Oireachtas committee but it is important to remind people that, in the first instance, what we are voting for is repealing the eighth amendment. I want to argue that it is absolutely critical that we do that because at every single level the eighth amendment has failed. Obviously, it has failed Irish women who, in situations of crisis or unwanted pregnancies where they have been raped or had wanted pregnancies but those pregnancies were doomed to failure because of fatal foetal abnormalities, had to make a decision to go to Britain for an abortion and had to do so under the pressure of stigma, the financial burden and hardship and all the additional stress that resulted from that. It has failed women who take abortion pills but may not get properly medically supervised or, because it is not just an abortion issue, women who were pregnant and were not given the medical treatment they needed because the doctors felt compromised by the existing legislative and constitutional position. For those tens of thousands of women, the eighth amendment has failed them. Indeed, it has failed them for many more reasons. It has failed even in terms of the claims of the supporters of the amendment because those who supported it peddled the fantasy that inserting that amendment into the Constitution would make Ireland a place free from abortion. Even on its own terms, that has simply not been the case.

Instead, 170,000 women have travelled abroad, with all the additional hardship, stress and suffering involved, to have abortions and three to five women a day are now taking abortion pills. Holding on to the eighth amendment, therefore, as those who oppose this legislation or who plan to campaign against its removal want to do, is inexplicable to me because it does not achieve what they are trying to tell people it would achieve. If it has not done so in the past, it most certainly will not in the future.

There is an onus on those making the argument against the removal of the eighth amendment to be honest with people. I heard Deputy Tóibín making reasonable points about poverty, homelessness and so on and that we need to address those issues. Of course we do, and week in, week out many of us who are campaigning for the removal of the eighth amendment campaign for precisely those things, as the Deputy does also. However, what he did not admit in his contribution is that retaining the eighth amendment means women who, for example, decide they cannot go through with a pregnancy because of fatal foetal abnormality or because they have been raped will continue to be forced out of the country for an abortion. Is that what the Deputy wants? Does he want them to continue to suffer the shame and the stigma because he is not outlining the alternative? Will he admit that what he is saying is that women should be forced to continue a pregnancy they do not want? People have to be honest here and say if that is what they are proposing because if the eighth amendment is retained, that is what they have got. Will they continue to propose that women who because of the housing and homelessness crisis could not face bringing another child into this world and choose to have an abortion should be subjected to a 14 year prison sentence if they try to procure an abortion? That is the reality of what retaining the eighth amendment means. It means we continue to have a 14 year prison sentence for somebody who takes an abortion pill or helps women procure it and continue to force tens of thousands of women out of the country under the shadow of stigma, shame, criminality and so on or that we continue to force women who have been raped to do the same. It is appalling, and those who wish to retain the eighth amendment essentially are saying that they will maintain that status quo. I do not believe that is what the majority of people want. They recognise that change has to happen.

I have some sympathy for people who say they do not trust politicians to sort out this issue but, and it is a big ""but"", putting the issue of women's bodies into the Constitution is an even worse prospect, as we have seen for the past 30 years. When it is decided in this House, at least ordinary people, so to speak, may be able to exercise some influence and pressure on the politicians, but controlling women's bodies and lives and futures through a constitutional amendment such as the eighth amendment has been an utter disaster for women and, I repeat, has failed to achieve even its own stated aim.

On the issue of the 12 weeks, it is very important to spell out what that means. The reason the 12 weeks is being proposed is because that is what is the case in many other jurisdictions where abortion rights of some description have been established but, critically, it simply acknowledges the reality that three to five women a day are already accessing the abortion pill in this country. If we say we should not allow women to make that choice up to 12 weeks, what we are saying is that we should continue to criminalise women who take the abortion pill. The anti-abortion movement needs to be honest about that. They believe that women who take abortion pills should be treated as criminals and if they do not believe that, they should explain to us what they are proposing, but that is what the eighth amendment continues.

Furthermore, they are suggesting that women who have gone through the terrifying trauma of being raped should have to prove they have been raped before they can get access to the pill. Is that what we are proposing? Putting any conditionality before 12 weeks would amount to women who have already been through the unspeakable trauma of rape having to convince doctors or whoever it might be that they should have the right to gain access to the pill. Surely that is utterly unacceptable.

It seems to me that what is being proposed in removing the eighth amendment is the absolute minimum requirement to come to a humane and compassionate position that stops us treating women in the appalling manner we have done and that the legislation being proposed by the Government is the absolute minimum necessary to recognise the reality of abortion in this country.";NULL

I am sharing time with Deputy Joan Collins.

Voting ""Yes"" is the necessary first step to ensure safe, legal and compassionate medical care is afforded to all women on an equal basis in Ireland. People are ready to repeal the eighth amendment because they are free to be more compassionate now and, unlike at any other time in our past, we are beginning to understand the principles of equality and equal rights. People have moved on more than most politicians in this House, many of whom will play catch-up on this issue, which may be the reason some will decide not to campaign or canvas in the lead-up to the referendum. I will canvass in my own constituency of Donegal where I have met many people who believe the eighth amendment needs to go.

I have seen a change in attitudes over time. Never before would someone have felt comfortable approaching me to express hope for a successful repeal vote. This is reflective of a change in the discourse on abortion and women's health care generally. However, abortion is still treated as a dirty word because public discourse on the issue has been suppressed for so long. It is important that a safe space is created for people who want to engage when we are canvassing because it will be the undecided who will determine the outcome of the referendum.

Much work remains to be done, particularly against the backdrop of mistruths and fake news. The controversy unfolding with regard to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica should be a lesson to us all in terms of the lengths to which opponents will go to win a campaign and the power of private sector interests to manipulate campaigns. It also serves to remind us of the real threats to democracy and the need to resource our regulatory and oversight mechanisms to enable fair referendums and campaigns to take place. Unfortunately, it will be too late for reforms arising from the current investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica to be implemented in time for the referendum on the eighth amendment. However, I am glad the Data Protection Commissioner is examining Facebook's role in the controversy unfolding in the United Kingdom and its effects on data usage here. This is especially important considering that Facebook's European headquarters are located in Dublin. It demonstrates that tighter regulation of companies' use of citizens' information is needed, as is monitoring of false news. Too often, we are exposed to myths and mistruths and pseudo-science presented as fact, with individuals claiming to be professionals in a particular field speaking with authority on an issue, despite not having any credentials to back up their claims.

Manipulation of the truth by third parties, individuals and campaigns that want to exploit public fears is already occurring ahead of the referendum. How can someone present false statistics, such as those presented in respect of Down's syndrome in the UK and Iceland, and be quoted by the media without any prior fact-checking? How can someone be allowed to stand in front of a school with grotesque imagery that does not adequately portray the truth of abortion and causes distress to vulnerable persons and children?

I echo calls made by other Opposition Deputies for greater transparency in online political campaigns to prevent the dissemination of disinformation ahead of the abortion referendum. Attention has been drawn to fake Facebook pages which, while purporting not to be related to the referendum campaign, include phrases and messages similar to those used by the ""No"" camp. Not only are these pages not sanctioned by the ""No"" side, but they are not operated by parties registered with Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. I understand that despite SIPO's efforts to have the Government provide clarification on third party involvement in campaigns, the Government has not responded to its call to do so.

The next step will require us, as parliamentarians, to use our privileged access to information and facts to vote for legislation which best protects the rights of our constituents. If Deputies were to truly engage with their constituents, they would recognise that everyone deserves the right to access to proper health care and bodily autonomy. I also believe all of us would support legislation to allow for unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks of gestation.

While I support the joint committee's recommendation to provide for unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks, I believe gestational limits have no place in legislation. Such limits are merely moral and political barriers for people who need an abortion and will only create a string of more hard cases in future. If we claim to trust or support women, we must acknowledge that they will make the best decision for themselves and their babies in the later stages of pregnancy. Abortion is required for a range of medical reasons outside the 12 weeks' limit which would fall outside the categories proposed by the joint committee. We must have a system that supports all women, regardless of what decision they make, noting that it is their decision and our role is simply to support them.

I understand the Together4Yes campaign will be officially launched this Thursday. The campaign includes a plethora of organisations and local groups which have come together to support repeal of the eighth amendment. I commend all those involved on the hard work they have done in bringing about a conversation on abortion in which dignity and respect are central. We must also recognise the medical community whose professionalism has been widely scrutinised at political level since the eighth amendment was inserted in the Constitution. It has come out strongly in defence of women's rights to health care at home.

Most striking have been those who have told their varied and compelling stories so strongly and bravely, despite the lingering toxicity created by the eighth amendment. Let us not forget how heavily the Constitution must have weighed on many women in this State and how heavily it continues to weigh on those who have carried the burden of the eighth amendment. Let us imagine this weight being lifted once the ""Yes"" vote has been carried. Those who made the decision to terminate, travelled to see their decision through and returned to tell their stories will no longer be seen as criminals under the eighth amendment but as liberators from a long and oppressive regime that has no place in a modern compassionate society.";NULL
2371;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Joan Collins;Independents 4 Change;"
I speak in support of a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment and substitute the wording of the amendment, as proposed in the Bill before the House. It is 35 years since the eighth amendment was inserted in the Constitution. During that period, a new generation of Irish people has grown up who did not have an opportunity to vote on an issue that can have a serious effect on their lives. I was proud to introduce, with Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, the Medical Treatment (Termination of Pregnancy in Case of Risk to Life of Pregnant Woman) Bill six years ago. Speaking last Thursday, Deputy Daly noted that it was strange just how far the conversation on this issue had moved on in the past six years. That is also an extremely positive development on which I believe Deputies Daly, Wallace and I played a small part by bringing the conversation on this issue into the Dáil Chamber. I also believe politicians lag behind the mood of citizens on this issue.

The main reason for change has been the role of people on the streets, including the women and men who marched on International Women's Day last Thursday. They were strong and proud and wanted the eighth amendment repealed. In the past week, I have been canvassing in my constituency and speaking to people who do not necessarily take to the streets to demand change. However, they too are thinking about this issue. I estimate that the level of support for repealing the eighth amendment among those I canvassed was approximately 60%, which is extremely positive.

The eighth amendment has been a complete failure from the point of view of those who advocated it in the early 1980s. From the perspective of those who viewed the amendment as a bulwark against the liberalisation and secularisation of Irish society, it has been a spectacular failure. The majority of those who voted in favour of the eighth amendment in 1983 were concerned that abortion would become widely available and many argued that its rejection would result in the floodgates being opened. From this point of view, it has also been a failure. While the number of legal abortions is low, standing at 27 or 28 per annum, this figure is dwarfed by the 4,000 abortions obtained outside the State every year. This figure refers only to those who give an Irish address. I believe many more Irish women do not give an Irish address when they obtain an abortion abroad. In addition, more than 1,000 women have abortions every year using medication obtained over the Internet.

The eighth amendment has not prevented abortion. Instead, women are forced to travel abroad to access abortions and many are also having abortions here. The rate of abortion among Irish people is similar to the rates recorded in comparable countries. This is accepted and tolerated. The abortion rate will not decline but the health of pregnant mothers is put at risk, as occurred in the tragic case of Savita Halappanavar in Galway. Many other women have also suffered as a result of the eighth amendment.

Modern health care is patient inclusive, meaning that when a problem is diagnosed the patient is often given advice on various options, for example, physiotherapy, medication or surgery.

The pros and cons are explained and if there are risks, they are explained and the patient has an input. For a pregnant woman, this would not apply, as decisions are made by medical practitioners under the chill factor of existing law. The woman would have no say or input.

The fact that women facing a crisis pregnancy are forced to travel outside the State or use medication obtained on the Internet poses certain health risks. Having to travel often means a later termination than would be the case in Scotland, for example, where 70% of terminations take place under nine weeks. The later the procedure, the higher the risk of complications. It would be safest practice for these crisis pregnancies to be dealt with here with all the medical backup, counselling and support needed in such stressful circumstances. It is important to note that today the Liverpool Women's National Health Service Foundation Trust, one of the main hospitals in the UK offering abortion services to women from Ireland with diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormality, has restricted access for terminations to women who are between 16 and 20 weeks pregnant due to staffing issues. The crisis in the NHS in England will affect the crisis in Ireland because women will not be able to access an abortion as early as they want to, even in Britain.

It is certainly not best or safest practice to allow people to obtain medicine over the Internet, not knowing how they are sourced and using them without proper medical supervision, as they may do with an abortion pill. Deputy Mattie McGrath commented on a report he saw in the Irish Independent that nearly seven in ten of 497 GPs in a closed doctor forum had stated they would not be involved with medical abortions. He goes on to say this was a closed forum and not just anybody phoned up or completed it online, as is the case with other polls. He said the 70% rate was pretty concerning and if the Government did not want to listen to it, to whom would it listen? The Deputy should have read the complete report, which indicated that a survey of almost 500 GPs found that almost two thirds would not provide abortion pills if the eighth amendment is repealed but rather they would favour following the UK example, with women referred by GPs to NHS clinics for medical abortions, and the pills would come from there. The Deputy failed to mention that element in the debate. In the Irish Independent report, of the almost 500 GPs surveyed by gpbuddy.ie in a closed doctor forum, almost 60% of GPs stated they supported repeal of the eighth amendment, with 25% saying they would vote against it. We should provide facts to the Dáil rather than selectively picking pieces that suit our own arguments.

This debate is not just about a woman's right to control her own body but it is also a question of a woman's health. I will campaign very energetically for repeal and I support the all-party committee's report on further legislation. Having said that, it has become clear in my mind that many people have reservations about the recommendation of abortion up to 12 weeks on demand. Over the weekend I spoke to someone who, while supporting repeal, also had reservations about the 12 week proposal. I am sure other Deputies and Senators campaigning and having discussions with constituents have found similar concerns. This is undoubtedly an area where the advocates of keeping the amendment will concentrate their well-funded campaign. We need to avoid being drawn into an emotional and aggressive debate, with so-called facts and figures thrown around that will confuse people rather than inform them. We need to keep the debate rational, with a focus on the work of the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party committee that based its recommendations on a wide range of medical experience and best international practice.

There is no test or medical examination to prove rape or incest. We cannot put medical professionals into a position where they must interrogate an already traumatised pregnant woman. The 12 week proposal is the best way to deal with pregnancy as a result of sexual crime and, of course, there is no compunction to have a termination. By repealing the eighth amendment and bringing in legislation, there will not be a compunction on anybody to have an abortion but it will provide a choice. Whatever decision is made by a woman, there will be support for that decision. The point must be made quite clearly. According to all recent polls, more than 70% of people support abortion as a choice for women subject to incest or rape. The message we must get out is that if we do not repeal the eighth amendment, the aspirations of women to access abortion will not be realised.

The 12 week proposal will not introduce the most liberal abortion laws internationally, as is claimed by some, but it will simply bring our laws into line with most other European Union states, where the norm is ten to 14 weeks. There is no proposal to introduce abortion on the grounds of disability and Down's syndrome, and they will be specifically excluded. It would be extremely rare to get a definite diagnosis of Down's syndrome in advance of being 12 weeks pregnant, according to Professor Peter Boylan. We must explain that the State with the most liberal abortion laws is the Netherlands, which has one of the lowest levels of abortions and where the rate is falling. That is a very important message. This arises because of Dutch investment in sex education and making contraception more freely available. I welcome the recommendations of the assembly and the all-party committee in those areas. Sex education should be taught through the school curriculum as set by the Department of Education and Skills rather than by small groups which come to schools to put their side of the story. It would make a difference if we moved that way. If people are educated well about reproduction and hope for the future, abortion rates will come down and there will be fewer crisis pregnancies.

We need to deal with these matters and the reality. There should be no more hypocrisy or Irish solutions for Irish problems. Nobody advocates abortion as the only choice but the choice should be there in our own country. I support the Bill before the House and the general recommendations of the all-party committee report. Points were made earlier about poverty, housing, health, disability and decent and equal pay for equal work. Essentially, people should not live in a society where they are underemployed and face economic and emotional crises. We should demand that the Government introduces Sláintecare health services and public housing so people can live a decent life with a roof over their heads. We should campaign for full disability rights, personal assistants, independent living and the protection of women's rights in the workplace. All this must be achieved in any society, and I have campaigned for them over a number of years along with others in this Dáil. Any practical and financial barriers, along with the criminal penalties, must be removed. I support this Bill.";NULL
2372;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Finian McGrath;Independent;"I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to this very important debate. I am fully aware of the sensitive and complex nature of the matter we are discussing. I am also aware of the wide range of views existing in this House and throughout the country on the subject. I am sure, however, that it is possible for us all to have a respectful debate, as I have seen so far. I welcome that.

There is a need for constitutional reform. I support repealing the eighth amendment and I strongly support a woman's right to bodily autonomy. The Committee on Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and the Citizens' Assembly before it have shown us a good example in this regard. The views of the constituent members may have differed but the debate never became personal. Each of us is approaching the matter from a position of wanting to contribute to the common good and do what is best for the people. I believe in the equality of women in every area of Irish life. I believe every woman should be free to make decisions about her personal and private life.

She should be free to consider the important decisions around having children and when is the right time for her to start a family. In respect of the 12 week issue, we have to deal with it in an open calm way. The 12 week limit would provide a woman with a window of around seven weeks during which she can realise she is pregnant, consider her options and make an informed decision in consultation with her doctor. Introducing legislation in line with this proposal would end the current situation where women access abortion pills through the Internet, alone and without the support of their doctor.

It would ensure access to care for women who have become pregnant as a result of rape. These are two crucial issues that have to be dealt with in this aspect of the debate. The Constitution cannot protect a developing pregnancy. The only person, ultimately, who can do that is the pregnant woman herself in consultation with her doctor. The referendum Bill is critical and an historic opportunity to ensure better care and health treatment for all pregnant women in Ireland. Removing the eighth amendment will mean removing a health care issue from the Constitution and allowing considered changes to abortion law to protect a woman's health and well-being.

Before getting into the business of the recommendations, I wish to take a moment to commend the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution on their work. I thank them for their contributions. I thank Senator Noone in particular for her calm and balanced handling of this issue as Chair. I also thank and commend the Chair of the Citizens' Assembly, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, and the members on their careful deliberations and valuable contributions.

As we all know, addressing the legal position on termination of pregnancy in Ireland would require a change to our Constitution. Article 40.3.3° of Bunreacht na hÉireann states:

The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.

The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 currently regulates access to lawful termination of pregnancy. Its purpose is to confer procedural rights on a woman who believes she has a life-threatening condition-----";NULL

Its purpose is to confer procedural rights on a woman who believes she has a life-threatening condition in order that she can have certainty as to whether she requires this treatment or not. Last year, the Government put in place a process to examine Article 40.3.3°. A Citizens' Assembly was established with the first order of business being to consider the eighth amendment of the Constitution. In June 2017, the assembly recommended that the eighth amendment be replaced with a provision that explicitly authorises the Oireachtas to legislate to address the termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn and any rights of the woman. The assembly also recommended a number of reasons for which a termination of pregnancy should be lawful in Ireland and the gestational limits that should apply.

An all-party committee on the eighth amendment was then established by the Oireachtas to consider the assembly's report and recommendations. I note that the recommendations contained in the committee's report represent the views of the majority of the members. There was not unanimous agreement on this particular issue. That brings me to the point about trusting in politicians. I trust the views of our Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution in respect of this issue. It was a cross-party issue with many different views. In other words, it was a people's committee.

The main conclusion of the committee's work was that change is needed to extend the grounds for lawful termination of pregnancy in this State. To effect that change, the committee recommended that Article 40.3.3° be removed from the Constitution by repeal. I support that recommendation. The committee then went on to make recommendations on the grounds on which a termination of pregnancy should be permitted in Ireland if Article 40.3.3° were repealed. In the first instance the committee recommended that termination of pregnancy should be lawful where the life or health of the pregnant woman is at risk and without distinction between risk to physical or mental health. Assessments should be made by no fewer that two specialist physicians and gestational limits should be guided by the best available medical evidence.

The committee accepted, secondly, that it should be lawful to terminate a pregnancy that is the result of rape or sexual assault. However, there were concerns about the practicability of including rape as a ground in legislation. The committee was therefore of the opinion that it would be more appropriate to deal with the grounds of rape or sexual assault by permitting the termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to reason up to 12 weeks' gestation, provided that it was availed of through a GP-led service and delivered in a clinical context.

The foetal abnormality issue is close to my heart as the Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities. The committee recommended that where the unborn child is diagnosed with a foetal abnormality that is likely to result in death, before or shortly after birth, it should be lawful to terminate a pregnancy without restriction as to a gestational limit. Where there is a diagnosis of a foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death, before or shortly after death, the committee recommended that the law should not provide for the termination of pregnancy. This differs from the recommendation put forward by the Citizens' Assembly, which proposed permitting the procedure up to 22 weeks' gestation in such cases.

I hope this divergence will help to reassure people about the careful consideration the committee gave to this issue. On this point, as Minister of State with the responsibility for disabilities, I attach a particular importance to the committee's statement that the State should provide specific resources for social supports for parents and better facilities for children who have special needs. This is of particular interest to me and is an important issue for me as well. That is why over the past 16 or 17 months we have restored the carer's grant of €1,700 to 101,000 families of children with disabilities. We have also brought back the issue of the medical cards for 11,000 children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, which cost €10 million. An extra €3 million was provided for the decision support service which will drive the engine room, as it were, of the UN convention. There was also an increase of €10 in the disability allowance in the previous two budgets. Recently, €10 million was announced for the ability programme for young teenagers and adults with a disability. In the previous two budgets, an extra €167 million was put into social care services. After listening to parents and families and also colleagues in the House, we have now recently announced an extra €10 million for respite care. These are issues that are important for disabilities. Of course we have to do more. I want to reform the services, invest in the services and, above all, put people with disabilities at the centre of the services.

It is important that we deal with this issue as well.

Speaking as the parent of a daughter with Down's syndrome who I would not swap for the world - our family is absolutely united on this particular issue and will all rally around my daughter - the real issue is we need to improve services. Diagnosis by CVS, chorionic villus sampling, where a small sample is taken away from the developing placenta and usually analysed in the UK, can take three working days. It should be noted CVS has a risk of causing miscarriage in 1% of procedures. Women may or may not elect to have this test. It is clear, therefore, that the diagnosis of chromosomal abnormality, while technically possible, can rarely or realistically be achieved before 12 weeks. To suggest, therefore, that disability will be eliminated by enacting legislation in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee is misleading. It is important we highlight this particular point.

The majority of Oireachtas committee members accepted the five ancillary recommendations set out by the Citizens’ Assembly in its final report. It also made recommendations, which I strongly support, for the decriminalisation of abortion, free access to contraception, comprehensive sex education and obstetric care as well as counselling. I am fully committed to ensuring all women accessing maternity services should receive the same standards of safe and high-quality care. Every woman from every corner of Ireland should expect to be able to access the maternity services she needs. The implementation of the national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together, will help this. Officials in the Department of Health, under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer, have established a group to address the recommendations and formulate an effective comprehensive response to the issues raised by the committee in its ancillary recommendations. The group will cover issues, both in the Department and the HSE, such as sexual health, primary care, acute hospitals, disability and mental health services, as well as any other areas subsequently deemed relevant.

Sometimes we are presented with the most difficult and challenging problems to deal with, areas in which the way forward may not seem clear-cut. In these circumstances, I believe our health care professionals are best placed to advise on the optimal treatment options. We should allow them, in consultation with women, to exercise their clinical judgment and the high standards of medical practice which we all know they uphold.

I come from the tradition of Wolfe Tone and Tony Gregory, which talks about including Catholics, Protestants and Dissenters with a strong emphasis on equality at the heart of our society. I look forward to a constructive debate on this issue and the issues raised by the committee. We must recognise the sensitivities involved and for this discourse to be respectful of differing views.";NULL
2375;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Éamon Ó Cuív;Fianna Fáil;"
The Constitution was introduced in 1937 and voted on by the people then. This is the first time we have been asked to put forward a Bill which will take away the most fundamental of human rights from people, the right to life. I note much of the time in this debate that the child in the womb is not mentioned. It is as if it did not exist. It is as if its health and its well-being do not count. I have a firm belief that human life in all its manifestations should be protected. It is a liberal belief. For many centuries, some lives were considered more important than others. One of the great steps forward in the 20th century was that, irrespective of race, colour or gender, human rights became more and more protected in both national and international laws. What we are proposing to do here is to take 100% of the human rights and human protection in the Constitution away from the unborn, right up to birth.

There are people who believe that unborn children are not human beings. As a parent and a grandparent, as well as looking at science, I cannot go along with the theory that they are only potential human beings. Are we saying that the minute a child is born at 24 weeks it is a human being while another child in the womb at 30 weeks is not? It does not make rational sense. Accordingly, this proposal has much more fundamental ramifications in the long term when we start differentiating between humans than any proposal put before this House since I became a Member. We must, therefore, all think deeply on it.

I also believe it is absolutely important that we protect women. As somebody who has been happily married for many years, the closest person to me is a woman. Her good is paramount to me. Accordingly, I have always agreed with Supreme Court interpretation, which I always believed from the very beginning was the only rational one, that if medical intervention has to take place to save the life of the woman and, if as an unintended consequence that the child’s life is not saveable, then of course one intervenes.

Savita Halappanavar has been mentioned many times in this debate. Unfortunately, that event happened in my constituency. When one looks at the reports, however, it is quite clear that mismanagement was at the heart of that issue. If the only way of saving her life had been to intervene, of course the law allowed that intervention. What the Irish people have been asked to do is to give this House carte blanche into the distant future into what it might do regarding abortion and, as developments take place that were already referenced to the people, that the House could do what it willed. Talking about Bills which might be proposed is of limited importance because once one opens the door here, there is no closing it again.

The Minister, Deputy Harris, mentioned the lonely place in which people find themselves for one reason or another in a difficult pregnancy.

I can fully understand those lonely places and empathise with that situation. However, we also have to remember there are many people who regret abortions, who do not live in a lonely place for a finite amount of time but who live with regret for the rest of their lives. Therefore, it is important, when we talk about this issue, that we think of the long-term consequences in terms of regret that could arise very easily out of this Bill. I know of very few parents but, more importantly, very few women who have had a baby and, when they see the reality of their child, have regretted it. I think most people would say that that has been their experience of life as well.

As I said, the Bill that might or might not be introduced is only what might happen in the next six months. It has, of course, no bearing or influence on what might happen in the future. Nonetheless, I think it is worth analysing what is proposed by the Government in the next six months. First, what is being proposed is basically a walk-in service to a GP in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. It has been seen through scans that, even after 12 weeks, the child in the womb is quite developed. Obviously, the question arises, if somebody develops a method of abortion that goes up to 15 or 16 weeks by some pill or some other method administered by a GP, does the logic follow that we allow the intervention on that basis up to 16 weeks? What is being proposed, once we go down this route, means there is no stopping where this is going.

Second, a lot of play is being made of the fact that 3,000 people go to England every year for abortions. Of course, we know that many of those people go for social reasons or for reasons of personal choice and not because of fatal foetal abnormalities or because of the very sad cases in terms of disability that people mention. Therefore, it is only rational that if one wants to stop people going to Britain, our law would have to mirror the British, because if there is a significant difference between the two, obviously, people can and will go to Britain. It is fair to say that this is basically what is being proposed by the Government, and I think it should say it quite clearly.

I was looking at the UK Abortion Act of 1967 which states it is not an offence to have an abortion when a pregnancy is terminated by a registered medical practitioner if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith, that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, or any existing children of her family, greater than if pregnancy were terminated. It then goes on to talk about the risk to the child but let us focus on what it states. In other words, in Britain two doctors certify, and in 95% of the cases of abortion there, it is under this provision that abortions are sought and provided. I think most people would say it is effectively a walk-in service.

What the Government here is proposing to provide for in the document it published is as follows:

Policy 1: That termination of pregnancy on the grounds of a risk to the health (which would include risk to the life) of a pregnant woman would be provided for...

Policy 2: That the General Scheme would make no distinction between a risk to the physical or mental health of a woman.

Therefore, again, there is no distinction between physical and mental health. We know from Britain that the vast majority of abortions are carried out under the mental health provision. The document continues:

Policy 3: That two appropriate (i.e. appropriate to the clinical circumstances) medical practitioners would be required to assess access to termination of pregnancy on the grounds of a risk to the health of a pregnant woman.

The only difference between the two is that one would appear to be going to specify that if it related to mental health, one would have to get a medical practitioner who had a specialty in mental health, in other words, a psychiatrist, whereas, in Britain, it appears that is not specified. Otherwise, what is being proposed here is the exact same regime as in Britain, although I am not sure if this document gives us a limit.

Let us be clear what is being proposed and put that to the people. Let us be absolutely clear that, basically, we are introducing the same regime as pertains in Britain. To be honest, it is rational from the Government point of view to do that since its stated aim is to provide here in Ireland what people seek in Britain.

Mar a dúirt mé i mBéarla, seo í an cheist is tromchúisí a thiocfas os comhair na Dála i rith mo thréimhse mar Theachta Dála mar táimid ag baint buncheart de dhaoine daonna - gasúir sa mbroinn. Is buncheart é atá cosanta sa mBunreacht. Má ghlacfaimid leis an leasú seo dar le seachtar breithiúna den Chúirt Uachtarach ní bheidh cosaint dá laghad fágtha sa mBunreacht. Is cuma cé chomh forbartha a bheas gasúr, ní bheidh cosaint dá laghad fágtha sa mBunreacht don leanbh sa mbroinn. Is an ceart daonna is bunúsaí atá ag aon duine beo é. Cuimnigh go raibh chuile duine a bhí ann riamh sa mbroinn ag am éigin. Tá an buncheart sin le baint amach ón mBunreacht.

Tá go leor daoine in Éirinn bródúil as an mBunreacht mar go gcosnaíonn sé cearta daonna, ach táimid ag déanamh cinneadh fáil réidh leis an mbuncheart sin. Chomh maith leis sin, tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach breathnú ar céard atá molta ag an Rialtas. Tá an-chaint go deo ar an 12 seachtain agus, mar a dúirt mé, níl aon srian air sin dul go 14 seachtain, 15 seachtain nó 16 seachtain amach anseo mar a dhéanfar forbairt ar phiollaí agus ar córacha leighis gur féidir a thabhairt san íoclann áitiúil. Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, tá gasúir á mbreith beo anois ag 23 seachtain ach beidh muid ag rá go mbeidh cead ginmhilleadh a dhéanamh suas go dtí an aois sin.

Tá sé thar a bheith spéisiúil breathnú ar an leagan amach atá sa mBreatain. Sa mBreatain má fhaightear dearbhú saighneáilte ó bheirt dochtúirí go bhfuil contúirt ann do shláinte mheabhrach nó fhisiciúil na mná, is féidir ginmhilleadh a fháil. Ní ginmhilleadh ar éileamh atá ann i Sasana ó thaobh an dlí de ach tá a fhios ag chuile duine go bhfuil sé ann go praiticiúil agus go saighneáiltear dearbhuithe go rialta. Níor chuala mé riamh faoi éinne a eitíodh ginmhilleadh dóibh i Sasana faoin dlí atá ann. Tá a fhios ag an Rialtas é sin.

D'ainneoin sin agus uilig, tá sé i gceist ag an Rialtas seo sa mBille atá i gceist aige a thabhairt isteach má éiríonn leis an reifreann seo an soláthar ceannann céanna a chur ar fáil. Beidh beirt dochtúirí fós i gceist, is é an t-aon difríocht ná go gcaithfidh siad a bheith cáilithe sa speisialtacht. Glacaim leis go gcaithfidh cáilíocht síciatrach a bheith ag na dochtúirí a bheidh i gceist más meabharshláinte na mná atá i gceist. Seachas an difríocht an-bheag agus an-teoranta sin is an soláthar céanna é. Cén chaoi is féidir le dochtúir a rá nach mbeidh cur isteach á dhéanamh ar shláinte na mná? Seachas an difríocht an-bheag sin, tá i gceist ag an Rialtas an solathár ceannann céanna a thabhairt isteach sa tír seo agus atá ann i Sasana. Tá sé an-spéisiúil smaoineamh ar an bhfocal Gaeilge ""ginmhilleadh"". Milleadh an ghin sa mbroinn. Tá sé i gceist ag an Rialtas é a thabairt isteach ar an mbunús sin.

Tá iarrtha ar an Teach seo vótáil ar son moladh a chur faoi bhráid an phobail a bhainfeadh buncheart d'aicme leathan daoine daonna. Ní fhéadfainnse tacú leis an gceist sin a chur os comhair an phobail, ar an gcaoi chéanna go ndiúltaíonn an Dáil seo go minic do mholtaí faoi reifrinn agus go ndiúltódh an Teach seo d'aon mholadh eile a bheadh ag baint buncheart den phobal.

What is being proposed is the taking away of the most fundamental human right from all unborn people, namely, the right to life. It is the first time since 1937 that, instead of adding to protection, we are taking away protection from every person who will be conceived. I cannot support the putting of such a referendum to the people, just as I could not support putting any other referendum to take away from the fundamental human rights of a wide swathe of people.";NULL
2376;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Michael Collins;Independent;"
Ninety-nine years ago Dáil Éireann met for the first time in the Mansion House, a building only a few minutes' walk from here. The First Dáil set out a series of principles to show the people what an Irish republic would look like free from Great Britain, principles that were put in place to ensure the republic would provide and care for its people. The eighth amendment is one of the many great things about Ireland that ensures the legacy of those who fought for our freedom will not be forgotten about.

In recent months there has been a great deal of spin about the eighth amendment. The press has been quick to argue against nearly all of the pro-life views expressed. There has been a deliberate attempt by it to silence pro-life views and ensure only one voice will be heard. That has been disappointing, to say the least. We are lucky that the majority of views expressed by Deputies in recent weeks have been respectful and I hope that will continue into the future. However, there has still been a great deal of disappointment. Everyone in the House knows that the pro-life side has been silenced. There are too many in the House who attack those who are pro-life. One person doing this would be one too many, but it is disappointing that a significant minority of Deputies are participating in the debate using such methods. Such methods should not be used in a modern democracy, but they have, unfortunately, become commonplace, not just in this debate but also across the political benches in the debates on a wide range of issues.

Members of the Citizens' Assembly sat through several presentations on the weekends they met, in some of which fleeting references were made to the issues on which they ended up voting, but not a single in-depth presentation was made on any of the 13 grounds for abortion that they ultimately approved and recommended to the Oireachtas. That is a devastating fact that completely undermines the entire process. For example, members of the assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of abortion on the grounds of a mental health risk to the mother. They did so without hearing a single presentation on the issue or from any expert witness. It seems likely that most members of the assembly were unaware that the result of the vote in question went against the peer-reviewed advice in this area of medicine.

Families who owe the lives of their children to the eighth amendment were excluded from the Citizens' Assembly. They say that having to travel to England meant a few extra days' planning and gave them time to think things through a little more and decide against having an abortion. They are horrified at the fact that they even once considered having an abortion a viable option.

When the Oireachtas joint committee first met last year, we were promised a fresh start and that the work of the Citizens' Assembly would not be repeated, but that is not what happened. The committee spoke to 12 witnesses who had previously spoken to the Citizens' Assembly. Like what had happened at the assembly, pro-life experts were given no voice at meetings of the committee which at the outset invited 24 pro-repeal witnesses and just three pro-life witnesses to present to it. On top of this, only three weeks into the proceedings, it was decided by the committee that repeal was, apparently, needed. On such a complex issue, it was a shame that this decision was taken.

We were also promised that ""experts"" and no advocacy groups on either side of the argument would be invited to the hearings. At the same time, pro-abortion advocacy groups such as the Irish Family Planning Association, the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights and the largest abortion advocacy group in the United Kingdom, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, BPAS, were invited. The BPAS which was, like the others, introduced as an impartial expert is one of the leading campaigners for abortion globally and has already registered in Ireland the domain name abortion.ie.

It has been estimated that since the eighth amendment was inserted into the Constitution in 1983, 100,000 lives have been saved. Even if the figure were only 10,000 lives, that would be enough. However, we are facing a dangerous debate in which these facts are forgotten by claiming that the 100,000 lives that have been saved would not matter if they had not been given that right. Such estimates have been written off as impossible to calculate, but they are easily calculable. In England one in five pregnancies ends in abortion. In Ireland that number lies at one in 19. If we move Ireland's abortion laws into line with what is in place in England and Wales, that is the type of figure about which we are talking. Bringing Ireland's abortion laws into line with those in other jurisdictions would also mean that unborn children with disabilities would be discriminated against, as pressure would be put on parents to abort their unborn children in such situations. In England 90% of children diagnosed in the womb with Down's syndrome are aborted. In some Scandinavian countries such as Denmark, the figure stands close to 100%. Every single one of us in this Chamber knows families who have children with Down's syndrome. Raising a child with the condition can be difficult, but every good parent makes sacrifices for his or her child and every family with a child with Down's syndrome will say what a blessing the child has been.

It should sicken us when we hear the statistics on abortion. In America, abortion is treated as a public good. The pro-choice think tank, the Guttmacher Institute has come out with the following statistics. Two thirds, which is 68%, of the 1.5 million unplanned births that occurred in 2010 were paid for by public insurance programmes, primarily Medicaid. By comparison, 51% of births overall and 38% of planned births were funded by these programmes. Of the 2 million publicly funded births in 2010, about half were unplanned. By comparison, 38%, or 1.5 million, of 4 million total births nationwide were unplanned. This representation of abortion as a cost-saving measure is not something any of us should want to see in Ireland. Statistics like this are designed to paint abortion as a public good because it saves the state money. Are we really going to start putting a value on human life? That is what abortion does.

Groups like the Guttmacher Institute are linked with Planned Parenthood which is the only winner in the US abortion industry. Staff at Planned Parenthood are paid based on the number of abortion procedures they provide. There is therefore no incentive to talk to women and encourage them not to go through with their abortions. In the Marie Stopes clinics in the UK, staff are given bonuses for ensuring that women who arrive in their clinics carry through with the abortion they sought when they arrived.

It has been said by several figures on the pro-abortion side that we need abortion in Ireland due to the number of women travelling to other jurisdictions for abortions. As I have already stated, Ireland’s abortion rates are much lower than Britain’s. It is true that much more needs to be done to help the women who return home after going through an abortion. It has been argued by the Minister, Deputy Harris, that we must have abortion to protect the nameless and faceless women who travel to England for an abortion. These women should be cared for in Ireland after going through such a traumatic experience but there are several other nameless and faceless women who did not go through an abortion because they had the chance to think about what they were going to do. These women openly discuss how they considered going through an abortion only to give birth to their child. The answer to the complicated issues that surround pregnancy should not be abortion. Abortion is an old-fashioned cure and it simply allows future Governments to ignore some of the most vulnerable in society. It allows for women to be made feel even more vulnerable. Abortion does not give a woman choice but it takes it away. This is because vulnerable women are made to feel abortion is the only answer by groups who are in the business of providing abortions. Ultimately, abortion ends a life prematurely before that life can have any chance to speak up or stand up for itself.

Two years ago we celebrated the centenary of the 1916 Rising. When we think of the Rising, every one of us thinks of the Proclamation. An essential sentence in the Proclamation is the promise to cherish the children of the nation equally. Let us not sully the memory of those who fought for our nation's freedom by taking away the right to life from society’s most vulnerable. Let us cherish the children of the nation equally at every stage of life from beginning to end. Let us not allow abortion to become legal in our country. Let us instead make sure that no mother feels she has to end the life of her child because she sees no other way out. Let us provide families in difficult situations with what they need to raise their child. Let us work together to make sure no child in this country is thought of as a choice but rather as a valued human being. Let us ensure that every child in Ireland is given the right to life. Let us stand up for mothers and their unborn babies. Let us protect the eighth amendment. In doing so, we would be doing something truly radical and positive by speaking up for life at a time when other countries have lost respect for the dignity and value of each new and unique individual. There is nothing radical about bringing in laws like other countries that have been shown over the past 40 years to discriminate against unborn babies up to birth. Let us be truly radical. Let us speak up for life and defend the eighth amendment with every ounce of energy we have.

Like a good man in my own parish of Goleen said to me one time about abortion, while there is breath in my body, I will never take the breath from somebody else's body. I certainly will not be doing that while I am here in Dáil Éireann.";NULL
2377;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Catherine Martin;Green Party;"
Tá an Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo. The introduction of the Bill is important for our society and our country. It marks an opportunity for change. It presents an opportunity to repeal an uncompromising article of the Constitution which has caused untold and unnecessary suffering for thousands of women since its inception in 1983. Ultimately, the Legislature must bear responsibility for the ongoing endangerment of the health and safety of women. The courts have on a number of occasions reminded us it is our function to legislate and they have, quite correctly, signalled their unwillingness to fill the gap and do our job as the Legislature.

The Green Party will support this Bill and will be campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote in the referendum that will follow. The eighth amendment has not worked. It has resulted in a system that has treated and continues to treat women appallingly. This referendum is an opportunity to make a change because change is needed. Not only have we abandoned women by forcing them to leave their own country to access a safe medical procedure, but also we have compounded it by threatening and sanctioning women and doctors with severe punishment and threatening them with jail sentences. The threat and stigma surrounding abortion puts women in a dangerous position and continues to tie the hands of doctors when it comes to emergency scenarios. When not responded to properly, as the country has learned to its eternal shame, it can result in the tragic and unavoidable death of mothers. Women should not have to steal away from their country to access a safe medical procedure and not one woman’s life should be put in unnecessary danger. It is time to trust women. We need to trust women.

The Minister said in his opening speech that moving towards the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee would represent a quantum leap from our current position. I welcome that leap, as our country is now ready to take it. I also acknowledge the Minister has committed to the principle that abortion in this country should be safe, legal and rare.

The Green Party supported the Citizens’ Assembly and as part of our support of that process we also support free, safe and legal access to treatments for pregnant people, up to and including legal terminations of pregnancy without restriction, up to 12 weeks’ gestation. The Green Party is in favour of deferring decisions on terminations after this point to such conditions and time limits as recommended by qualified medical practitioners who are subject to the Medical Council.

As a country, we are an outlier. The implementation of the recommendations of the committee will bring us in line with Greece, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Finland and France, among others, in allowing access to abortion up to 12 weeks. One of the many lessons to be learned from 1983 is the need for the Legislature to be trusted as the Constitution is unsuitable for detailed provisions that tie the hands of future generations. It is time to move forward with compassion.

I recognise the work of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment, particularly that of the Chairman, Senator Noone, for coming to a considered, shared and compassionate set of recommendations. I hope the upcoming referendum campaign will be a respectful one. I hope we can have a frank, positive and constructive discussion on the issue. I hope we become a country that provides full support for all women who decide to continue with their pregnancies as well as providing support to those who do not. I welcome the debate today because for too long the voices of our elected representatives were not sufficiently loud nor adequately effective, just, coherent or steadfast. That is why we are where we are today where some women’s lives continue to be endangered. Ireland can no longer pretend, indefinitely postpone or prevaricate, and that is why the Green Party will support this Bill and campaign for a ""Yes"" vote in the referendum.

2378;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Sean Fleming;Fianna Fáil;"This legislation will lead the way to a referendum after approximately two weeks. People will have different views on the matter to be decided by the people but I believe the function of the national Parliament is to let the people have their say. I urge people who are not happy with that approach to reconsider their position and accept the decision of the people when they make their decision. We should not do anything to frustrate the decision.

Others have done it but I wish to set out precisely what we are talking about as regards this referendum. The phrase ""repeal the eighth"" is very strongly embedded in the public mind but this referendum is not about repealing the eighth - it is about repealing the eighth amendment and substituting new wording for it. There is no proposal to delete the eighth simpliciter and I ask all commentators to bear this in mind. People are now talking about ""repeal and replace"" as the approach as it is not a question of delete versus retain. That may have been the view of the Oireachtas committee but it is not the view of the Government in terms of what it has brought forward here.

Article 40.3.3° reads, ""The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right."" It is proposed to substitute the words, ""provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.""

This all arises from the referendum we had in 1983 which put the eighth amendment into the Constitution. There have been various other referendums on the right to information and to travel and there has been legislation in the form of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which flowed directly from the eighth amendment. People were concerned when the eighth amendment was passed that the situation would not be clear and the Supreme Court would end up making decisions, which it did and which resulted in the Oireachtas passing the legislation to which I referred. The Minister may correct me on this but I believe that, over the two years since the legislation was enacted, approximately 50 pregnancies have been terminated where the life of the mother was in danger. In seven of those cases, suicidal tendencies were one of the reasons given. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 deals with the provision in regard to the eighth amendment where the life of the mother is deemed to be at risk, either for physical or mental reasons. If the referendum is defeated I assume that the status quo remains in the Constitution and the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 remains on the Statute Book.

Somebody felt it was a good idea to have a consultation on the matter so we had a Citizens' Assembly of 100 people, randomly selected from the voters' register. The assembly sat for a considerable period of time but I was very confused at the end of it and did not know what it had decided. Some 48% of members wanted provision for termination at 12 weeks, 44% wanted termination at up to 22 weeks and 8% of those attending wanted no time limit at all, but to delete the eighth amendment and replace it with a wording devised by the Government.

It was then agreed to bring the matter back to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. I will not go into how the committee did its work and some people have different views on it but it did its work and I take the report it published as the report of the committee. After detailed consideration and lots of meetings, the committee decided to use the phrase ""delete simpliciter"", which meant a straight deletion of Article 40.3.3°, and it agreed with a provision to have a termination at up to 12 weeks without justification. I accept that the phrase ""on demand"" is probably not correct because women carrying a child in a difficult situation do not go around demanding abortions. They do not have to justify their decision up to 12 weeks and it is not right to say that they ""demand"" abortion as it is often the last option they have, based on their own circumstances.

The Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution did not accept the view of the Citizens' Assembly, which wanted to delete and replace, and it had different views on the number of weeks, with 12 or 13 different votes taking place on the options. Some appear a bit contradictory and the outcome was that the committee came up with a different proposal, namely, to delete simpliciter. Then the Government looked at it and came up with the words ""delete and substitute"", before producing its policy paper on the termination of pregnancy. The Government has not accepted the views of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution but came up with a different wording and a policy paper rather than proposed legislation at that time. The Government may agree with the committee on the 12-week limit but the principal recommendation of the committee was to delete simpliciter, while the Government came up with a different option, probably following the advice of the Attorney General. The assembly came to one view and the Oireachtas committee did not accept its views. The committee produced a report but the Government did not accept its views. No group agreed with the group that worked on this previously. That is not helpful and it shows that the issue is more confused than people might appreciate.

The legislation has been drafted now and I have waited for it before speaking on the subject. I have a problem with the words ""provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy."" There are different stages of a person's life and some people have a long life while others have a short life. We have to respect the rights of all children at all stages of their life and that includes the unborn child.

People have spoken about the road they have travelled on the issue in recent times. I have been in the House for a number of years and I had been here for about a year when we had a referendum on the Twenty-first amendment to the Constitution on 7 June 2001. That removed the provision from the Constitution for capital punishment, that is, the execution of a person for the killing of a garda, one of the most serious crimes in our Constitution. It was a very difficult time but, out of compassion and respect for human life and regardless of whether they thought a person was the worst convicted criminal in the State, the people of Ireland believed such a person's life was sacred and that he or she should not be executed.

The legislation provided for life imprisonment. This Parliament put forward a referendum a number of years ago relating to people proven guilty of a capital offence in Ireland and we said that life was sacred no matter how dastardly the act of the person convicted of murder was and that we should not take life. The people of Ireland decided in that referendum that life should not be taken in the name of the people and that provision was removed from the Constitution. Now it is said that we have travelled a road and people are saying that perhaps we should insert what they call a positive provision in the Constitution to provide for the termination of pregnancy - the termination of the life of an unborn child. I think we have gone full circle and I would ask people to think about the full circle we have travelled in this Parliament. I know that one of the last times people were asked about the sanctity of human life, even that of a person found guilty of a capital offence, they respected the sanctity of human life, difficult as that is. Some people would say that not respecting the sanctity of human life is moving forward but I do not think everyone would agree with that point of view.

I know the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution said that dealing with cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities was too complex. It said it was very complex and that one cannot prove a rape took place. I think the debate in the committee took the wrong emphasis. In respect of cases involving rape, nobody should have suggested or even talked about having to report something to the Garda. We know how long a court case can take. People must name the person who they believed raped them. For people to even have that discussion was all wrong. If the woman felt that intercourse was non-consensual, that should be enough. She should not have to go to the Garda and commence criminal proceedings. There was and is a way of dealing with those issues through legislation, notwithstanding the fact that the committee felt that it was too complex. I think it would have been possible and is still within the ability of this Oireachtas to legislate for those issues if it chose to do so but that is not the option before us. The option before us is deleting the eighth amendment and substituting a provision for the termination of pregnancy.

This leads on to what has been proposed if the referendum is passed. The Minister has issued a policy paper on that issue that is available for people to read but it is no more than a policy paper. There is no guarantee the Minister will provide for this when it comes to drafting the legislation. Many important issues are dealt with in that policy paper but there are issues about which some people will take a different view. The Minister does deal with policy but this referendum might have a better chance of passing if the Government had been more specific, taken more time and let the people know what sort of legislation they would get if they passed the constitutional amendment. Instead it has said what it is thinking about, that it needs to have a discussion about it and that it needs to get further legal and medical advice and the agreement of the Oireachtas. It is a long way from what we know will be the outcome of the legislation and this lack of certainty opens the door to an enormous extent and people should be concerned about that.

Essentially, one of my disagreements with putting in that particular provision is that it allows Deputies to decide the matter. I want the people to think about this. As I said, very important issues are dealt with in the Constitution and I would consider the issue of life and death to be a matter for the people to decide rather than Deputies. I am concerned that Deputies want to take too much power for themselves. Any time during recent years where the people have been asked in referenda to give Deputies more power, they have said ""No"" and they have said ""No"" for good reason. One of the reasons is that there are 158 of us here. Most of us come in with a particular point of view. We have a particular bias on most issues either for or against, although some are probably neutral and their views change over a period of time. We are not a neutral assembly. We would not be much of an assembly if we did not have views so I do not think the Oireachtas is a neutral forum in which to pass legislation on this matter. I believe it would be better if the people had the final say.

People say that we should not insert a provision on a complex issue into the Constitution. Nobody is suggesting we do that. Nobody believes that would be a sensible idea. However, when it comes to a big European treaty, we have a referendum to allow the people to give the Oireachtas the authority to adopt the treaty. Similarly, those European treaties are not written into our Constitution but a section is put in allowing the Oireachtas to ratify the particular treaty. Similarly, legislation could be drafted where the specifics are in the legislation and we could then have a referendum to give the Oireachtas the power to ratify that legislation. This is one of the ways we should have gone about this.

The Houses of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service has produced a very impartial analysis of recent referenda setting out why some were carried while others were not. The people said ""No"" to the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Houses of the Oireachtas Inquiries) Bill, which was a proposal by the last Government to give Deputies more power to carry out investigations. They did not want to give Deputies more power. I am quoting the reason given by the Houses of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service. It said there was a feeling that the people were not sufficiently well informed. More critically, it went on to say that many people rejected the proposal as it would give politicians too much power. If the people of Ireland felt that they did not trust the Oireachtas to carry out investigations into matters of public interest, I think the public may well come to the same conclusion and not trust the Oireachtas to pass legislation on a matter of life and death. The Oireachtas Library and Research Service gave another example when it said that Government supporters were generally in favour of a Government proposal while those not in support of a Government were not in favour of a Government proposal so it became a bit politically partisan.

The last Government, which included most members of this Government, brought forward another referendum in 2013 to abolish the Seanad. Here was a proposal to give Deputies more power. It was a case of, ""Let's abolish the Seanad and let's concentrate power in here and if there's a few of us running the Government and we run the Dáil, sure the few of us will decide what's good for people and sure we'll get rid of the Seanad and we'll have less public scrutiny and accountability."" The principal reason given why the people rejected that referendum proposal was that they did not trust the Government and not a lot has changed since then.

The document produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service says that the second reason people gave for not accepting that proposal was because of the perception that the proposal was a power grab by politicians. Here we are again. We have a referendum on a life or death matter but we want to grab the power to decide it instead of letting the people decide the issue. If there is to be legislation dealing with termination of pregnancy, I would have no problem with publishing that legislation and asking the people whether or not the Oireachtas should have the power to ratify it. I am not saying I would support it but the people would know precisely what they were voting on. What we are being asked to deal with here is too vague. It gives the power to Deputies and I do not believe matters of life and death should be solely in the hands of Deputies. It would be far better if it were left to the people. People say we cannot have a divisive debate but I think it has been a very civilised debate and I think it will continue to be a civilised debate. If somebody comes forward with legislation on a particular issue in years to come, I see nothing wrong with putting the question of whether the Oireachtas should ratify it to the people. That is a better way of going about it. With the divorce referendum, specific proposals relating to the divorce legislation were included so people knew precisely what they were dealing with on that occasion.

To summarise my position, I believe in the right of the people to have a vote on this issue. What the people decide should be the final word on the matter. I would not agree with preventing the people from having a say on this matter. There has been a lot of criticism of the eighth amendment but the new provision that is proposed to be substituted for it is causing bigger problems.

It is a power grab by Deputies to allow them to pass legislation in the Oireachtas. It is a case of ""Give us the power to pass the legislation"". We are asking the people to give politicians a blank cheque on life-or-death matters. Those serious matters of human life should be decided by the electorate, not by a small group of Deputies in this House.";NULL
2379;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Martin Kenny;Sinn Féin;"As Members are aware, we are debating whether it is appropriate to retain the eighth amendment in the Constitution or, as outlined by the previous speaker, to replace it with a phrase suggesting that this matter be legislated for by the Oireachtas. There has been considerable debate about family, children, mothers, etc. The natural instinct of all of us is to protect life and care for pregnant women. It is the role of all medical professionals who work so hard and whom we trust to do the right thing at all times. Many of those medical professionals appeared before the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and gave their evidence. I meet many people who work in the medical area. I certainly have not come across any whose instinct is to try to take life away; they want to bring life into the world. That is what they are there to do and that is what they always want to do.

The eighth amendment is preserving what is called the equal right to life of the mother and the developing embryo in the womb. That is what it provides for. I came to a decision on this matter approximately 18 years ago. My daughter is now 17. I have four children. On our second child, Ava, my wife was very ill, but not critically, and she was in hospital for a large portion of the pregnancy. I came to realise that difficult decisions needed to be made in a minority of cases. Fortunately, we were not in the position where we were the minority within that minority where the really hard decisions have to be made. However, it happens.

I came to realise that having this locked into the Constitution was not appropriate. In that minority of the minority of cases, the eighth amendment has another provision, which is that it creates the equal risk to ill health and possibly even of death of both the unborn and the mother. That is the problem; the equal right to life has a reverse side to it. That is what we are dealing with here; we are dealing with a minority within a minority. We need to be big enough to recognise that sometimes the greater good is to look after that minority. That is really what we are talking about doing here. I understand that people on all sides have very strong views and it is an issue on which there is considerable debate.

Many people, including many speakers this evening, have said we cannot trust the politicians. If something happens to us, however, we have to trust the medical profession. We need to pass this along to the profession in order to allow it to do its job appropriately in that minority of the minority of cases. That is really what this involves. We understand that people sometimes feel they cannot trust politicians. However, they have an option to change them if they cannot trust them. When people think about this issue, they usually talk about things that happened in the past when politicians made all kinds of wrong decisions and shady deals were done. Those decisions were made and deals were done well away from the very intense spotlight there is on this issue.

People heard all the views very clearly during the debates at Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and came to understand the position. If the eighth amendment is removed from the Constitution - it may not be - we will have the opportunity to come back here and discuss all the issues relating to 12 weeks and the other matters that are difficult for people. We will do it in the open and everyone will understand the positions that people hold. While I could be wrong, I am of the view that the result of this may be much less liberal than people fear. However, we will see. Time will tell.

We need to recognise that what is in the Constitution does not work. It does not work for a very small minority, but that minority are citizens of the State and are absolutely entitled to have their rights upheld. In order to do that, we have to grapple with this very thorny issue. In some places it will be difficult; it is difficult for all of us. Ultimately, we have to deal with it.

All of us in public life meet all kinds of people with various problems. I am sure most of us will have dealt with people who have been traumatised as a result of sexual abuse, rape or incest. That brings trauma to their lives and some of them are incapable of continuing with a pregnancy which may have resulted from that. We have to understand that and deal with it. Others may be well able to deal with that and want to go on and have the baby. Again, we have to understand and respect that, and ensure that they are able to do that safely. It is not something that should be compulsory under any circumstances.

Another issue has been much discussed. I met a woman recently who, along with her husband, had planned to have a child. She had worked for a long time to get pregnant and then, quite early on, discovered there was a huge problem and that the child would not live. This woman did not want to tell her family and friends of her circumstances. She did not want to go through that trauma and she chose to go to England to have an abortion. It was very difficult for her because she came from a devoutly religious family and it went against everything they believed in. However, she was trapped in this place. She felt it was wrong for her and we have to recognise that.

Some of the issues in this debate are difficult. I have heard people talk about being pro-life. I do not know many who are not pro-life. All of us are pro-life. I also hear people saying - I have been accused of it - that some people are pro-abortion. I do not know any who are pro-abortion any more than they are pro-chemotherapy if a person has that terrible disease and they have to try to do something about. In that circumstance we need to deal with this and understand it.

Ireland has changed since 1983. The vast majority of people who become pregnant choose to be pregnant; they want to have babies and want to bring life into the world. In the vast majority of cases, they are successful in doing that. However, we have to have the courage and ability to deal with that minority of the minority. As a result, the people need to be given the choice as to whether they want to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution and allow, as we are asking them to do, the Oireachtas to decide the circumstances in which we can do that. That will be decided in the full spotlight of the public's view. It will not be done behind closed doors or in a shady corner somewhere. It will be done here - out in the open. People will see and understand why the result will be what it will be. In those circumstances, I firmly believe that people will understand that the right thing is done.

The right thing for us to do now is to put that to the people and let the people decide on the eighth amendment. Then we can come back here, have our debate respectfully, put the issues on the table and move forward.";NULL
2380;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Pat Buckley;Sinn Féin;"
I am very proud to be a Deputy for the constituency of Cork East, particularly in this Dáil, which will finally bring to a close a shameful period in Irish history whereby women's health was turned into a political battle by the religious right. The eighth amendment was a grievous mistake, cooked up by a cabal of activists intent on holding back the social progress of this island. The same people opposed divorce, decriminalisation of homosexuality and, most recently, marriage equality. The people will no longer tolerate a backward, closed-minded Ireland. This referendum gives them another chance to push our nation forward. I am confident that they will enthusiastically accept this opportunity.

I commend the work of the Citizens' Assembly and the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, both of which worked diligently and fairly to develop a response to the obvious issues that arose from the enshrinement of the eighth amendment in the Constitution 35 years ago.

It is a great pity that some of those who refused to engage properly sought to use their work to grandstand and protest rather than to advance understanding or to encourage discussion. They did this clearly as they felt they could not adequately address the weight of medical, psychiatric and legal evidence against the maintaining of the amendment. This was an insult to the public, and also to the democratic institutions of the State. It was very disappointing that some would try to dismiss the hard work of the committee and its members. I am proud of the three members of the committee from my own party who took part, and I stand by their conclusions. I also want to commend the Minister and the Government for its work in this regard. Many previous Governments have at best ignored the issues, while others have actively sought to limit further the rights of women to health care and to tie the hands of their doctors. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I do not agree all the time, but his recent thoughtful and clear comments were very much appreciated, and I give credit where it is due.

We deserve no great applause for finally acting on this matter, but I am very glad that we have, and am also glad for those who have put their heads above the parapet in the last few years. However, I want to pay tribute to the real heroes. They are the women up and down this island who have struggled tirelessly before and since 1983 to realise a society where women are trusted and respected. The eighth amendment has cost lives and impacted on the health and comfort of countless women. We will never truly know the scale of the damage it has done over the 35 years, but much of the medical evidence we have heard, from experts in their respective fields, lays bare the many pitfalls it set for doctors and the women they cared for. For many years politicians and the media chose to ignore these realities and the toll it had on the women of Ireland. Those days are over, thankfully. We know the stories of the women who, for 35 years, were victimised by this law.

The question that we as a nation are now being asked is not what we think of abortion or what our personal or philosophical opinions about the beginning of life are. It is simply, do we trust women? Do we trust women and their doctors? In a perfect world there would be no rape, no unwanted pregnancies, no physical or psychological threat from pregnancies and no fatal foetal abnormalities, and so there would be no abortion. We do not live in that world, however. We make things so much worse by pretending we do and digging our heads into the sand. We must decide whether the lives of the living, breathing women deserve the full medical protection afforded to everyone else in our society, or if the pregnancy somehow limits their right to health care. There is no perfect conclusion to this question, but we have seen the damage that occurs when we decide that a pregnant woman is not deserving of this right to health care and that her doctor's hands are tied. I never want to see another case like those of Sheila Hodgers, Ann Lovett, Savita Halappanavar, or those of many nameless women, such as Ms X, a child pregnant due to rape, or Ms Y, who refused food in protest and was operated on against her will. There is only one way to deal with this very difficult and tragic situation, and that is to repeal the eighth amendment and to finally give women and doctors the ability to make the medical decisions appropriate to the care they desire. I urge people to trust women and to repeal the eighth.";NULL
2381;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Carol Nolan;Independent;"My party is in favour of repealing the eighth amendment in specific cases. However, my personal opinion is that the eighth amendment should be retained, as I am proud to say that I have strong pro-life views. We are all aware of the fact that unborn babies are the most vulnerable in our society. Surely then, as a society, we must protect them and embrace each and every child, and their differences, as an inclusive society. The eighth amendment has saved 100,000 lives since 1983, and I am sure we have all heard the personal accounts of young women who have stated that they were glad the eighth amendment was in place when they experienced crisis pregnancies. Many of these women admitted that if abortion had been freely and readily available in this State they would have availed of it and lived to regret the decision later, decisions born from panic and isolation.

I firmly believe that abortion is not a solution. Research has shown that it can often have detrimental and lasting effects on women's health. For example, the latest study on abortion in the British Journal of Psychiatry found that abortion itself increases the risk of mental health problems for women by 81%. I acknowledge the fact, and the harsh reality, that women in this State do experience crisis pregnancies. Those women need adequate supports, and those supports must be put in place so that they are not left isolated, vulnerable and fearful. Those women are being let down. However, abortion should never be presented as a panacea. How can it be an acceptable solution when it takes away the right to life of the unborn, which is a fundamental human right?

The recent ruling of the Supreme Court was a wake-up call to us all in this State. We are faced with a clear decision in the forthcoming referendum. We can chose to retain the eighth amendment, which is the only legal protection for unborn babies under which doctors in Irish hospitals protect the lives of both patients - the mother and the baby - or we can repeal the eighth amendment and face the prospect of abortion being normalised in this State.

I believe that the deletion of 40.3.3° from the Constitution, which would remove the right to life of the unborn, would be a very regressive step, and one which we as a society will live to regret. Every child has the basic, fundamental right to life, and that right to life is non-negotiable. We should cherish and uphold this fundamental right, and we should not repeat or replicate the mistakes of England or other countries where abortion has been normalised and liberalised.";NULL
2382;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Charlie McConalogue;Fianna Fáil;"
I welcome the opportunity to speak on the debate. It is appropriate that sufficient time has been given to Deputies to express their views. At the outset I want to indicate my own position, which is that I am not in favour of repealing the eighth amendment. I believe it is important that the right to life of the unborn is recognised in the Constitution, which is our primary guiding document. It is a very important principle and is something which should be contained in the Constitution. I acknowledge that it is a very difficult issue and that there are very many difficult cases involved. I also want to acknowledge the work of the committee, which took the time to look into this and to tease out in great detail the various considerations and to hold hearings in the Dáil over many, many weeks. I thank those members who took part in that committee on behalf of the various parties in the Oireachtas and those who spoke at the hearings, as well as the staff who participated. I acknowledge the work those people carried out. One does not have to agree with the outcomes to respect the fact that much work was done and time spent on behalf of the Oireachtas. It is now appropriate that the matter comes back to the floor of the Dáil so that everyone can consider those issues. It is appropriate that the public will ultimately get the opportunity to have their say on what is to happen and what our laws should be. I welcome the fact that so far the debate has been very respectful. I am hopeful that will continue. People can hold differing views, and those views are genuinely held, so it is important that that is respected.

It is important that we allow people to live their lives as they so choose, whether that be according to their own religion or to no religion.

People should have the freedom and the right to go about their daily lives and live them to the full, so long as that does not impinge on the rights of others. As regards abortion, I believe there are two lives to be considered in a pregnancy: those of the mother and the unborn. All countries, even those with liberal termination regimes, recognise in legislation that there are two lives in a pregnancy. All countries have laws which restrict terminations of pregnancy because there is a recognition that two lives are involved. Some countries have more liberal regimes than others but in all cases there is recognition that there are two lives in a pregnancy and that the life of the unborn must be considered. In my view, that should be given the utmost consideration. As all members know, the health and welfare of the mother is paramount but we should also take every appropriate and possible step to ensure the life of the unborn is protected and considered.

The Supreme Court last week clarified that the rights of the unborn are only crystallised in our Constitution in the eighth amendment and are not otherwise explicitly present. It would not be appropriate to do away with that recognition of those rights. There is no doubt that there are difficult cases but the accommodation of such cases should not lead to the withdrawal of the protection of the rights of the unborn from the Constitution and that protection should remain in place.

A decision in respect of the upcoming referendum will be difficult for many people. The approach taken by my party in terms of allowing each Member to vote according to his or her conscience is appropriate and right because this issue is very personal to people. People will question themselves in respect of the referendum and each person can take a very different but genuine view on how he or she will vote on the issue. However, the outcome is likely to be far closer than the polls suggest. For many, it will come down to a choice between keeping the situation as it is or voting for what is likely to be abortion on request up to 12 weeks because the proportion of Members who have indicated in favour of 12 weeks is just short of 50% and if Sinn Féin changes its approach, as has been indicated by its leadership, it is clear that a majority of Members will be in favour of up to 12 weeks. In terms of the campaign and how the public will consider the matter, it is increasingly likely that if the eighth amendment is repealed, a regime will be put in place whereby abortion on request will be allowed up to 12 weeks' gestation.

It is very important that the protection of the unborn continue to be recognised in the Constitution, which is the appropriate place for it, and for that reason I am very much in favour of retaining the eighth amendment and will be voting against repeal";NULL
2383;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Catherine Connolly;Independent;"
I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate. I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for his approach to date and his well thought-out speeches. I also thank the Citizens' Assembly and the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. However, we are not here because of the Minister's speech or the work of the Citizens' Assembly or joint committee, notwithstanding the excellent work they did. We are here because the Government and previous Governments have been excoriated in the courts as far back as 1992, when Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy in a Supreme Court judgment from which I will quote in due course, criticised the Government on its failure to bring in appropriate legislation almost ten years after the 1983 amendment. We have been excoriated in the European Court of Human Rights and two United Nations committees on human rights. We are here because we have brought shame on ourselves and the eighth amendment has caused appalling suffering to women and loss of life.

I often find myself in agreement with Deputy Ó Cuív and, on occasion, with Deputy Mattie McGrath but the interpretation of the case law by my colleagues on my left who are really on the right beggars belief and leads me to believe that they have not read it. I have read every relevant case that has come before practically every court of the land, the European courts and the UN committees. I think the only court that was left out was the Circuit Court. Women have appeared before the District Court, the High Court, the Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations committees. They have either gone there themselves after a very traumatic abortion in England or have been brought there by the agencies of the State. I will go through that case law.

I wish to correct a number of inaccuracies. It has been stated that we are rushing legislation through but the opposite is the case. The eighth amendment was made in 1983. The X case was heard in 1992 and it is important to point out that it involved a 14 year old girl who had been subjected to repeated sexual abuse over 18 months, culminating in a rape. That poor girl, who is now an adult, is living with that legacy, as is her family, and must cope with Members continuously talking about the X case. As I stated, during the course of that judgment the Supreme Court excoriated the Government of the time for not bringing in legislation following a gap of almost ten years. One would imagine that a government would learn from that and listen to the well thought-out rationale of the Supreme Court. However, rather than that being so, a series of cases were brought by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, SPUC, to control information and travel. Indeed, an injunction that restricted my basic right and that of other women in terms of what information we could receive remained in place for four years. There were two more referendums after the 1983 eighth amendment referendum, one of which regarded travel and information and also the exclusion of risk of suicide as grounds for abortion. When the people of Ireland rejected that, those who insisted that life was black and white brought forward another referendum to exclude the risk of suicide as grounds for abortion less than ten years later, which the people refused. In parallel with those developments, appalling cases were coming before the courts I mentioned, with some of which I will deal.

Another piece of misinformation being disseminated is that the death of Savita Halappanavar had nothing to do with abortion and was simply due to a lack of basic care. As a proud Galwegian and one who believes in public medicine, I believe that a fundamental part of the problem was a lack of basic care and, unfortunately, that remains the position as a result of the systematic running down of our public health system and the failure to employ sufficient staff or have enough beds. However, it is absolutely disingenuous to say that was the only cause of the death of Savita Halappanavar. I have read the entire report and recommend that those quoting from it would also do so. It is 108 pages long, including appendices. It states that a key causal factor was the failure to offer all management options to a patient experiencing ""inevitable miscarriage of an early second trimester pregnancy including where there is prolonged rupture of membranes and where the risk to the mother increases with time from the time that membranes were ruptured"". In case that is insufficiently clear, the investigation team states it is satisfied that concerns about the law, whether clear or not, impacted on the exercise of clinical professional judgment. If we are to quote, let us do so comprehensively.

The notion that we will have the most liberal abortion laws if we go down this road is also totally inaccurate. I ask Members to read the turascáil from the comhchoiste. I also ask them to read the Bill digest where they will see all of the figures. In terms of opening the floodgates, that has never happened. I like to be precise. A very small number of abortions were carried out following the 2013 Act. In 2014 the total figure was 26, of which the total due to the risk from suicide was three. In 2015 it was 26 with the total due to the risk from suicide also being three. In 2016 the total was 25, with the total due to the risk from suicide being one. In addition, we have the number of women going abroad. No floodgates were opened in Ireland as a result of the 2013 legislation.

It was mentioned already by Deputy Paul Murphy that Sheila Hodgers died yesterday, 19 March, 35 years ago. It is significant that she died in March, which was six months before the eighth amendment became law. She died at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda after giving birth to a premature baby who died almost immediately. The hospital had refused to allow her to stay on treatment because it would harm her unborn child. That was prior to the eighth amendment. She was denied an X-ray and pain relief. That was Ireland in March 1983. Her husband asked at various stages for an abortion, early delivery of the baby or a caesarean section and all were refused. That inhuman medical treatment occurred just six months before the people of Ireland voted in the eighth amendment. It was quite clear when they voted for it that the pain, anguish and death of Sheila Hodgers had not led to any period of meaningful reflection or learning on the part of society, rather, the cold ambition of preventing abortion was to be at any cost to the life and health of women and it was also in complete denial of the reality of the thousands of pregnant women who travel out of the country each year, including in 1983. We have the figures in that regard.

Year after year following that, women came before every court in the land, in Europe and before the United Nations committees. The movement was to give certainty in an area where certainty cannot apply. We know that from all of the cases I will outline in detail. However, we knew that at the time as well. Peter Sutherland, the then Attorney General appealed for it not to be done. Unusually, the then Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, took the step of publishing the advice. In 1983 he said:

Far from providing the protection and certainty which is sought by many of those who have advocated its adoption, it will have a contrary effect. In particular it is not clear as to what life is being protected; [We know of course now that the life of the mother certainly was not being protected] as to whether 'the unborn' is protected from the moment of fertilisation or alternatively is left unprotected until [...] Further, having regard to the equal rights of the unborn and the mother, a doctor faced with the dilemma of saving the life of the mother, knowing that to do so will terminate the life of 'the unborn' will be compelled by the wording to conclude that he can do nothing.

We know that is exactly what happened as case after case came before the courts. I respect the opinions of those to my left who have spoken but I ask them to inform themselves about the facts. If they believe that this is not what happened I refer them to a number of very recent judgments. I refer to a case dating 3 December 2014. The family in question did not have a very good Christmas that year. On that date a 26 year old mother of two children who was pregnant with her third child, who had previously been admitted to hospital, was diagnosed as being brain-stem dead but because she was pregnant she was kept alive. The father of the woman, in agreement with her partner, was forced to take a High Court action, which finally led to a judgment on 26 December, St. Stephen's Day 2014. What is noteworthy in regard to the eighth amendment are the notes of the doctor in 2014 which said that they were not to do anything that would get them into trouble from a legal point of view, and that they were awaiting legal advice. That was the High Court in 2014 which finally agreed with the father that the woman should be allowed to die with some measure of dignity.

The lead-up to the case can only be described as grotesque. A woman who was dead was kept alive. Make-up was applied to her to make her look okay when her children visited her, all because of the eighth amendment. There is no doubt about that in my mind, but what is in my mind is not important, what is important is the evidence that came out in the case before the High Court that the eighth amendment led to the doctor not doing anything and so that woman was kept alive in 2014, in the second decade of the 21st century. It is quite clear that the tentacles of the eighth amendment have stretched into areas never foreseen, such as keeping a dead woman alive.

Another case in 2016, a little over a year ago, concerned a woman who had three caesarean sections and wanted to go as far as she could in her fourth pregnancy. She knew in the end she would probably have to have a caesarean section but the doctor took a view that she was endangering the foetus and that he had a duty to act under the eighth amendment. A High Court action was taken to force her to have a caesarean section. Fortunately, the judge decided it was a step too far to order the forced caesarean section to be carried out on a woman against her will, even though not making the order increased the risk of injury and death to both Mrs. B and her unborn child. The High Court judge went on to give the woman a lecture on the decision she was making. He said she was making a bad decision, one he would not make, but he considered it a step too far to interfere. Since then, Justine McCarthy did us all a favour by publishing the story on the front of The Sunday Times. We saw a lovely young woman who gave the human side to the High Court case where she was taken to task by the judge. She said she simply wanted to go as far as she could with the natural process and that was her only reason. She said she would make her mind up in the end.

We are asked not to be emotional but as a woman it is difficult not to be emotional when I read all of those cases and I listen to a debate where some of the speakers talk about protecting women's lives and say that of course treatment is given. No, treatment is not given. It was not given in the case of Savita. I have mentioned the High Court action concerning the dead woman and the case concerning the caesarean section. That leads me to the area of fatal foetal abnormality and the untold distress and upset that has been caused. In one case a woman had twins, one of whom was dead and the other was going to die, yet she was forced to go the whole way to the European court. On that occasion, unfortunately, the court agreed with the Government's argument that she should have exhausted every remedy at home. It was said there was an arguable case that perhaps the courts would have given her permission to have an abortion. Can one imagine that woman, pregnant with twins, one of them dead and the other with a fatal foetal abnormality that was going to die yet the Government argued, very recently, that she should exhaust every remedy right up to the Supreme Court and that she should only then go to the European Court of Justice? That is the nature of the law we have here.

I refer to the special cases, the cases that should have led to reflection and forced politicians to do something about it. They are the cases that should have led every man and woman in this Dáil to say, ""Oh, good Lord"". We are hearing one thing from the church about human life being sacred, but this is the reality on the ground. We had the X case involving a girl who was 14, followed in 2006 by another case with a letter from the alphabet, only this time the girl was a year younger, again the subject of a rape in the care of the health board who wanted to go abroad to have a termination. The health board was helping her to go but the parents took an injunction in the District Court to stop her.

The A, B and C v. Ireland case was before the European Court of Human Rights. The C case involved a woman with cancer. We then had the Mellet and Whelan cases in 2016 and 2017 in regard to fatal foetal abnormality. How many more cases do such courageous women or their families need to bring before we reflect and use a different type of language here?

In terms of the figures for those who are leaving on a daily basis, and we should be precise and use the figures from the Bills digest, between 2010 and 2015, some 5,650 women used abortion pills. Every year in each county, 3,265 women leave to go abroad for an abortion. Will we ignore all of those women or will we look at their profile? Their profile is not what we imagine. It is largely women between the ages of 20 and 40, and 69% of the abortions took place before nine weeks gestation. Some 49% of the women were married or in a civil partnership. That is the profile of the 3,265 people who leave our shores every year but we want to ignore that and pretend it does not exist. As a woman, I certainly cannot pretend that it does not exist.

I will reluctantly talk about my personal circumstances. I come from a family of 14, equally balanced, seven and seven. I am someone who suffered the loss of a mother at a young age. I bring that into the debate not on an emotional level, but to say that we are not pro-life is insulting. It is worse than insulting. It is dangerous because it seeks to polarise a debate that should not be polarised. It is preventing a debate based on evidence and facts, and it is allowing a myth to continue that the eighth amendment saves lives when it has actively caused the death of women and others to suffer seriously. It has also seriously disabled and disempowered them. I ask that we read the cases, read the Bills digest and come back in here to make a conscientious decision, which I respect, but based on evidence and what is happening on the ground.

In terms of criminalising abortion and having a 14 year penalty in the 21st century, words fail me. The fact that it has never been implemented is very worrying in a sense because the purpose clearly is to terrorise, isolate and demonise.

I welcome the Minister's approach to date. I am sure I will disagree with him on many other issues, and certainly on the state of the health service nationally and also in Galway city, but I thank him for his approach to this matter.";NULL

I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am in favour of holding this referendum to give the people their opportunity to vote on this issue. It is one of the most important social issues that will come before this Dáil. It is an issue which involves morals, ethics, society, religion, biology and deeply personal issues. No one answer will satisfy all those issues or satisfy everyone.

This issue of termination of pregnancy has the capacity to be deeply divisive. Termination of pregnancy has been a feature of cultures and society throughout the millennia. The nature of termination of pregnancy has moved away from back street abortions experienced through the early parts of this century and many other centuries and it has become a medicalised and controlled issue for the safety of the mother. No longer will women die from a mismanaged, unsupervised termination.

However, there is no escaping the biology of embryology. It is a linear development of a baby from conception to delivery. The interference of that developmental process by termination of pregnancy is the ending of the life of a human being, and there is no way we can get away from that reality.
However, it is up to each individual to make an ethical and moral judgment as to the rights and wrongs of termination of pregnancy in the circumstances in which they find themselves. Thus, should the eighth amendment be repealed, the nature of the legislation to provide for termination of pregnancy will be centre stage.

The recent Supreme Court judgment has clearly decided that the only right of an unborn child is the right to be born. Should the eighth amendment be repealed, that right will no longer exist. The stark reality is that the unborn will have no rights whatsoever in the Constitution. Any rights will have to be defined by legislation. I believe that will be a major issue in the debate.

Currently in Ireland, termination of pregnancy is legally allowed only if the life of the mother is at risk, not the health of the mother, in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and not for rape. I believe repeal of the eighth amendment is necessary to allow for those eventualities. At present, there is a serious contradiction in that it is legal to have information about termination and to travel abroad to have a termination, but it is not legal to have a termination here in Ireland. That is seen as acceptable to some as it gives the impression that termination of pregnancy is not happening to Irish women, but of course it is - it is just not happening on the island of Ireland.

We have to realise that we are no longer isolated from the outside world and we cannot pretend that we can place barriers to insulate ourselves from the outside world. How do we balance these moral, ethical, social, religious and deeply personal issues? How do we balance the right of the unborn baby with that of the mother and still recognise the reality of what is happening today with regard to termination either by post with unsupervised medication or by travelling abroad for surgical termination? I do not believe we can balance those rights in our evolving society with changing medical advances.

The decision of a woman to terminate her pregnancy without reference to reason or without specific reason prior to 12 weeks is a deeply personal decision which has inevitable consequences for the developing human being. There is no biological uncertainty that there is a developing human being involved whose life will be lawfully terminated as the baby will not have any right to life. The 12 weeks issue will be the lightning rod on which this debate will revolve. The 12 weeks limit is being introduced to accommodate the reality of the several thousand women who choose to terminate their pregnancies for myriad reasons, and I do not believe any, or certainly not many, undertake such a termination lightly.

Regarding rape, in reality, no woman who has been raped should ever progress to a developed pregnancy as they should all be able to access the morning after pill within 48 hours of being assaulted to prevent implantation.

I have a number of issues with the policy paper the Minister has produced. The first is the definition of appropriate medical practitioners. The legislation would include all registered medical practitioners on the medical register. I believe that is too loose because it does not require the medical practitioner to have any particular expertise. That needs to be defined and teased out.

Second, regarding certification and notification of terminations made to the Department of Health, we should ensure that this information will be anonymous and that identity will not be public knowledge. That is extremely important.

The issue of conscientious objection for medical or nursing personnel also needs to be clearly defined. In the event that the eighth amendment is appealed, it is proposed that a general practice-led service for the termination of pregnancy up to 12 weeks will be provided by means of the prescription of medical termination medication. This is a hot issue among general practitioners, with 58% of respondents to a recent survey of general practitioners indicating they did not wish to participate in a GP-led termination service. The Minister must carefully consider this issue. Is a general practitioner-led service in place in any other jurisdiction? My understanding is that in most countries where termination of pregnancy is permitted, it is provided in clinics, rather than in the community. What training, supports, diagnostics and medical indemnity will be provided to general practitioners who participate in a GP-led termination service?

Access to diagnostic ultrasound is highly restricted in this country. Will confirmatory ultrasound examination be required to assess gestational age? If so, will this be readily available in a timely manner to women who present wishing to terminate a pregnancy?

General practice has been seriously underfunded and was disproportionately subjected to funding cuts under the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation during the austerity years. Underfunding commenced under the former Minister for Health, Ms Mary Harney, and was accelerated under the subsequent Minister and current Senator James Reilly. It continued under the current Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health and persists under the current Minister. How will a community-based termination service be delivered by a crumbling general practice service, even if general practitioners wished to provide a service?";NULL

Considering that under the maternity strategy, we are struggling to provide anomaly scanning for each pregnancy, will maternity services be given sufficient resources to provide proper assessment and enable informed decisions to be made by mothers and their doctors to provide for lawful terminations? The Government's proposals in this area will require substantial investment. All the issues I have raised will need to be addressed if the eighth amendment is repealed.

In summary, I am in favour of holding a referendum and I will support the repeal of the eighth amendment. Termination of pregnancy should be provided for in cases of substantive dangers to the health and life of the mother and fatal foetal abnormality. As I stated, in cases of rape, the victims should never get to the stage of a developing pregnancy. The critical and most contentious issue is the 12 week termination limit. It is also the issue about which I am most unhappy, although I acknowledge that it is necessary to recognise the position of those who wish to terminate a pregnancy for whatever reason. They should be accommodated in this country, rather than being forced to travel abroad. We must take ownership of this issue and stop exporting it. As unhappy as we may be about abortion, this is the 21st century and we must recognise how medicine and society have developed by introducing legislation that is restrictive but not excessively restrictive.";NULL
2387;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Martin Ferris;Sinn Féin;"
It is essential that the debate on this issue inside and outside the Oireachtas is carried out in a respectful and cordial manner and that all points of view are heard. We must not go down the road of the 1983 referendum campaign when people were viciously attacked and called murderers and so forth. Much of the conduct during that debate was disgraceful. Thankfully, the debate on the forthcoming referendum has been respectful thus far and I hope that will continue.

All of us must make a difficult decision on the eighth amendment and we will all agonise to some degree before taking a position on the matter. I did not give the issue of abortion much thought after the referendum in 1983 until a personal experience in my family much later. In 2001, my son and his wife were expecting their first child, who would have been our first grandchild. Four and a half or five months into the pregnancy, they were told their child would not live independently because the brain of the baby in the womb had not developed and would not develop. As a result, the baby might not survive birth and if it did survive, it would not be for long. The medical reports provided by the gynaecologist indicated there was a danger of the baby dying in the womb and outlined the potential consequences in the event of such a scenario. It was suggested that my son and daughter-in-law could opt for early inducement or seek a termination outside the country. They were devastated, as were my wife, Marie, and I, when they told us this news and asked for guidance on whether to seek a termination to protect the life of the mother or take a chance and see the pregnancy out. There was no doubt that the child would not survive. They took a decision to persevere with the pregnancy in the hope that nothing would happen to my daughter-in-law. The baby was induced in early 2002 after seven and a half months in the womb and lived for 58 minutes before dying in her parents' arms. We were all present and I will never forget it. If matters had gone the other way, the four children my son and daughter-in-law subsequently had would not be in this world. They have since had two lovely little girls and two little boys, although they are no longer little as they are 14, 11, nine and six years old. The family has a grave for the baby who was born and survived for 58 minutes. Her name was Seoidín and they visit the grave frequently. Her mother and father visit every week and her brothers and sisters also visit regularly. I consider them very fortunate in that things could have gone terribly wrong. Perhaps if a facility for abortion had been available in this country at the time, circumstances would have been different. In any case, things worked out well.

I have given much thought to this issue in recent months, as have my comrades in Sinn Féin. One tries to put oneself in a position where a daughter is the victim of rape or a fatal foetal abnormality is diagnosed and the only way out is for one's daughter to get on a boat to England to have a termination. I do not know if Deputies heard a heartbreaking interview on radio this morning in which a lady gave an account of her circumstances, which were similar to those of my daughter-in-law. However, as there was a danger of cancer, she took the decision to seek a termination and went to England. She broke down many times as she described her experience. She said her one regret was that her mother was not with her after she had her pregnancy terminated.

The cruellest part of all was that she and her husband had to bring that baby home. They got a little coffin but there was a delay. The weather was very warm because of the time of year and they had to buy ice packs to put in the coffin to bring their baby home. They did that on a bus, with the coffin in the compartment underneath. They described the difficulties they had on the bus. When they arrived at the port in this jurisdiction, they came to a checkpoint but the garda on duty, to his credit, waved them through.

When I listened to that this morning, any doubts I had were wiped away. As legislators, we have failed that woman and the 3,500 people who make similar journeys each year. We have failed the 8,000 or 9,000 people who obtain abortion pills annually. We have failed many of the people mentioned by Deputy Connolly just a few minutes ago. We must do the right thing and support repeal before debating what will follow. We must empower legislators to do the job they are elected to do. Let the testimony of people who have been through what that woman described this morning on the radio be a help to all of us who have a tough decision to make. I have no doubt that her story touched many people. Before I was ever elected, people came to me and told me about having terminations. These were young people in particular who had to go on the boat to England for terminations and they had no support on their return. They were hidden and received no counselling or other necessary support. They were afraid to go for it in case somebody found out about it. There was a stigma attached to it because of a lack of legislation that would help people.

We can do this right. There is scaremongering by some people that we could open the floodgates but I read recently that there are states in America with proper procedures in place and the abortion rates have been reduced to an absolute minimum. There are counselling facilities prior to procedures and a delay to allow time for decision-making in order that people can ensure there is no other option. If there is a termination, counselling facilities are provided afterwards to help the people involved. It should be an example to all of us.

If we do not face this, we will fail the hundreds of thousands of women who have left this country stigmatised as criminals. We will fail the people - like the lady I heard this morning - who take the boat and who, in some cases, bring back a child in a coffin for burial. I will support the repeal of the eighth amendment and I would be delighted to take part in the subsequent debate on legislation. The leaders' debate that occurred after the Minister announced what would happen was one of the best examples I heard from all those leaders. It demonstrated a maturity in dealing with and presenting the issues. It was respectful, and long may that continue in this debate.";NULL
2388;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Robert Troy;Fianna Fáil;"
I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, which has been ongoing since the country voted to insert the eighth amendment into our Constitution over 30 years ago. The beauty of our Constitution is that it belongs to the Irish people and it is only they who can amend it. To date, the debate has been very respectful and I hope that will continue to be the case. I compliment those who served in the Citizens' Assembly and my colleagues who served on the Oireachtas committee that brought forward these proposals. I do not wish to undermine their views or diminish the work they have done, but it will be the people of Ireland who will have the ultimate say. It was far from helpful of Ministers to say that if the repeal side loses, the result will not be accepted. Everybody in the House is entitled to a view and to campaign or articulate a view. They can try to influence people and apprise them of the rationale of that view. I encourage both sides to continue to do so.

I am very conflicted in my personal views. I voted against the protection of life during pregnancy legislation in the last Dáil because I felt a person's mental state is transient. What a person feels today might be totally different from what he or she will feel next week, in a fortnight or in a month. I gave an example at the time of that legislation being debated in the Oireachtas of a school friend who took an overdose. I was the person who came to him. At that stage in his life, he was very lonely and unhappy. Today, however, he is very content and happy and living a very fulfilled life. He felt an awful lot better in a matter of days and weeks after getting particular help.

There was a Private Members' proposal to facilitate terminations in the case of life-limiting conditions, where a parent with medical advice and guidance chooses to go through with a termination. I voted in support of that. My colleague, Deputy Ferris, outlined, quite clearly and compassionately, the rationale behind such an instance. The name the lady used this morning is not her true name. The name used was Ciara. She outlined the antagonising journey that she faced when she had to go across the water to have a medical termination. Nobody should be forced to do this but some people, for whatever reason, make that choice. We should facilitate that. If somebody chooses to go full-term in a pregnancy where there are life-limiting conditions, we do not offer the required level of support in perinatal hospice care. We are failing in that regard.

What strikes and disappoints me is that during previous discussions we spoke about the need for greater medical care when someone goes through a pregnancy and for greater standards of care. We argue there should be greater consistency and the same level of care across the island but it still has not happened. Some of the findings and recommendations in the report of the Oireachtas committee indicate that there must be a greater standard of equal care across the country. That is still not happening.

The ability of women to access anomaly scans at 20 weeks depends on their geographical location. We talk about improvements to counselling and support facilities for women. Again, they are not where they should be and have not been. We have been speaking about this for years now. We talk about enhanced and improved perinatal hospice services. Again, we had the same conversation during the protection of life legislation and, unfortunately, they have not advanced and improved to any great level in recent years.

We are still talking about what we need to do and are still promising what we should be doing but at the same time, we are failing to deliver. We have spoken about the need for free contraceptives to help prevent unwanted and unplanned pregnancies. I note an article published last week in the Irish Independent in which the Minister stated that if this legislation goes through, if the referendum is passed, then he would consider introducing free contraceptives. I do not think it should be a matter of whether the referendum passes or fails. That is something we should have done a long time ago.

Perhaps there is greater emphasis on introducing repeal of the eighth amendment than on considering some of the other measures that can help in respect of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies, such as how we teach sex education to children and teenagers and the areas of free contraceptives and perinatal care. We did not need the Citizens' Assembly or the Oireachtas committee to tell us that this is what we should be doing. We should not be doing it now; we should have done it years ago. Personally, I have no issue where medical intervention is needed to save the life of the mother or the child. Medical professionals have said that as it currently stands, it is problematic and needs to be changed. I believe that most people accept terminations in the instance of medical reasons.

I do, however, have an issue with 12 weeks in the case of a healthy woman and a healthy child. I also acknowledge that in this country, we have voted to give a right to travel and a right to information. Thousands of women every year, for whatever their reasons, opt to travel across the water to seek medical attention. We know from the evidence given to the Oireachtas committee that, unfortunately, many women here opt to take tablets to bring on a termination where there is no supervision or medical care in place. That is worrying and something we need to address.

I honestly believe this is a choice for the citizens of Ireland to make. I am lucky, in this instance, that I can choose according to my conscience when I go to vote at the referendum. I am happy to vote to facilitate a referendum and I will be supporting the legislation to ensure we have a referendum. When I go to vote at the referendum, as it currently stands, I still have grave reservations in relation to the 12 weeks. However, I pledge that I will abide by the choice and the decision of the Irish people. I will not participate in the debate but I will abide by their decision. We all need to acknowledge that the wisdom of the Irish people will prevail with regard to this referendum and I look forward to it taking place. I encourage everybody on all sides of the debate to continue to debate in a respectful manner and to acknowledge the alternative view. Then it is our job as legislators to give effect to what the people of Ireland decide.";NULL
2389;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;F;Ms. Anne Rabbitte;Fianna Fáil;"
I welcome the opportunity to speak here tonight. It is not my first time to speak on this particular issue in the Chamber. I served on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. Like many other people, I am torn by the whole issue and have been from the very beginning. I am clear about that. At present, the debate is on the referendum and on the issue going to the people. One reason I am speaking tonight is to state I will be supporting the fact that there will be a referendum. The people put it into the Constitution and it is the people's choice to do with it what they so wish, that is, to leave it in the Constitution or to remove it from the Constitution. I have only one vote, no different from anybody else who is over 18 years of age, and that is how I will be exercising it.

However, on the substantive issue as to how does Anne Rabbitte feel on it, I always have been very clear. I always said I was open minded but when we are drilling down into it, I will not be supporting the repeal of the eighth amendment. I will not be supporting the 12 weeks. That is not something I am comfortable with in my conscience for all the reasons my colleague, Deputy Troy, has outlined here. I do not believe we have the systems in place to support women who wish to carry babies to full term. I do not believe we have the right perinatal hospice care. I do not believe we have the same standards of care throughout the entire country. That is regrettable and when the various people from the various medical professions appeared before the Oireachtas committee, they told us it is not equal throughout the entire country. That is wrong. Why should a person on the west coast or the east coast not gain the same care? We are not providing that for them.

There is another issue. We talked about contraception. The morning-after pill to me is one huge issue outstanding that we should be addressing at this very moment. I refer to the fact that there is a charge of €30 for it. There should be no charge for it because we could have an immediate support for people who find themselves in a crisis situation. That can be addressed. To some people, €30 is a large amount of money. I refer to the 17 year old, the 16 year old or to whosoever of whatever age. They should be given that right and that access opportunity. I listened to ""Morning Ireland"" this morning and that story undoubtedly was hard-hitting. We heard that story at the committee when the man sat in front of us and told us his story. It was different when we heard the husband who had supported his wife through that entire journey. I think it took him a number of years to recover from it.

While I do not support what is before us at present, I do not have the right to impose the story we listened to this morning on anybody. Unfortunately, however, given the way it is worded at the moment, there are no other forms of discussion. That is where I have a difficulty, namely, with the 12 weeks and the way it is being presented. I wish for a respectful debate and I would like to think that all times when it was being discussed by the committee and since it has come in here to the House, the debate has been totally respectful. It should continue in that manner. We do, however, need to inform the people and not scare them. They should be given true facts and not false facts. That goes for anybody on whatever side they are supporting. Scaring people into thinking that they have to vote a particular way is not right either. Let them hear the full stories and let them hear more of Ciara's story. I also welcome the opportunity to listen to the story of the lady who will appear on tomorrow morning's programme. They are the people who will inform us. They are the people who have worn the shoes.

We also have to listen to the women who choose to bring a child to full term. We have to listen to what supports they found they did not receive, as well as the time they spent with that baby, whether for five seconds or five minutes, and the benefits they got from that. We also need to know exactly the role the GP is going to perform in all of this and if we have them all on board. There is no point in bringing everybody to the top of the hill if we do not have the supports when this is passed or rejected. There are lessons to be learned from what we need to do, particularly with perinatal hospice care.

I have made it clear that I want to support a referendum. I did not vote in the last one. I will be telling everybody to come out. The only way it will be delivered is in the ballot box and everyone putting in their vote.";NULL
2390;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Eugene Murphy;Fianna Fáil;"My time is limited but I have spoken before on this issue. I am conscious of the fact that, between Members and staff, there are seven women present in the Chamber. Some of them may say, ""Here is a male talking to us."" I hope, however, they understand where I come from because I am a parent of two beautiful and healthy teenagers. I also have a nephew and a grandniece who suffer from autism. As I have said before in the Chamber, those two little people have brought so much joy to our family. I often talk about the challenge parents of children with disabilities have and the struggles they have every day with the system. While in many respects, issues have improved, there are many other issues regarding children and people with disabilities which are still lacking.

I also heard the lady referred to on the radio this morning. Deputies Rabbitte and Ferris said it was heartrending. I also heard Tanya last Friday on the same radio station on the other side of the argument. We can look at the story from every side. They are sad, tragic and happy. It is a funny thing to say but that is the reality. Deputy Ferris spoke sincerely about doing the right thing. What is the right thing? I know the Minister himself, deep down in his own mind, is not happy with all of this. However, he has responsibility as Minister. Many people are not happy with this. I have a good working relationship with Deputy O’Connell and others, but I do not agree with them on this issue. I feel, as a father who has seen scans of our two children at eight and ten weeks, that life does begin at an early stage. The formation of the body is quite clear then as is the heartbeat. People ask why I mention the heartbeat. I witnessed it as a father. It is a strong thing in my mind in this debate and I speak about it constantly.

If we go for what is suggested on the 12 weeks option, abortion would become normalised in our society. Abortion is legally available in 195 countries. While I have not been able to check each of these countries in my research, there is a huge amount of opposition in most of them to abortion.

Not one church person of any persuasion, Catholic, Church of Ireland or Presbyterian, has pushed their opinions on me. I got no letters or emails from most of the churches. I did get a nice letter from the Presbyterian Church, asking me to support keeping the eighth amendment. I also got hundreds of letters and emails from my constituents, the bulk of which asked me to support the eighth amendment. That is what I have to do.

Several doctors in my constituency have approached me and asked me not to vote for repeal. They are reluctant, however, to talk in the media. Tonight, I ask them to speak out. While there are others who say we should support repealing the eighth amendment, I ask the medical people who have difficulties with repealing it to come out to state this is where they stand and let people know of their concerns. I cannot support what is proposed by the Government and I will be voting to retain the eighth amendment.";NULL

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this subject. Whether one is pro or anti, it is a sensitive issue. I have my own views on the eighth amendment which are based on my own life’s experiences. I do not favour the repeal of the eighth amendment.

I listened to many Members speaking tonight and previously about this matter. From my life's experience, I know life is very precious. For me, the life of the unborn is precious and needs to be protected. Last week in Tuam, I got a phone call when I was walking down the street from a dear friend of mine from another part of the country. He asked if he could run something by me. It was a simple story. When he was a young man, he and his wife, unfortunately, could not have children. Accordingly, they adopted several children. One of the children they adopted grew up, fell in love, got married and had children of their own. My friend now has grandchildren of whom he is very proud. They are the making of his life at this stage when he is approaching 80 years of age. The mother of these grandchildren was born out of wedlock. Her mother would have gone for an abortion to England but she did not have the money. For me, that is what life is all about, namely, the fact that the baby was not aborted, grew up in a loving family to have her own children and provide such accommodating and lovely grandchildren for my friend who is now in his 80s. He took the time and the trouble to ring me to tell me if I got an opportunity to speak in the Dáil Chamber that I should relay that story. That is why I am relaying it here tonight.

It is important that we reflect on our beliefs. They are all very personal to us. We all go through life and have different encounters. Deputies demonstrated tonight different stories, personally and otherwise. We must respect all of that. We have a decision to make whether we support repealing the eighth amendment. We must make the decision as Deputies. I believe we should have the debate. When the vote comes, I will be voting to retain the eighth amendment. I believe it is important to state that so the people who asked me what I would be doing in this regard hear me state it publicly. I have told them privately what I would do. The reason for that is very personal.";NULL

I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this very difficult debate. For a long time, I have held back because I wanted to study the evidence from the joint committee and the various contributions that people made, as well as the Minister's Bill, in order that I could try to make the most informed decision possible. I also took the opportunity to meet various groups which have very different views on this issue. Clearly, there are no easy answers and very difficult decisions must be made, whichever way people have gone when they are faced with the question of having an abortion or not. I do not think anybody arrives at the answer easily.

Where I get stuck is that there is a life and, afterwards, there is not. It is what I cannot agree on. I am trying to make the most informed decision I possibly can and, based on everything that has been made available to us, I do not see that I will be able to support the Minister's Bill.

Braithim go bhfuil sé fíordheacair ar aon duine cinneadh a dhéanamh maidir le ceist an ghinmhillte. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbaileoimis pé eolais is féidir linn chun teacht ar an gcinneadh sin, ionas go mbeimid in ann cinneadh réasúnta maith a dhéanamh agus ionas go gcinnteoimid go bhfuil an rud ceart á dhéanamh againn.

The courts have looked at the rights an unborn child would have, if any, and decided that there is only one, namely, the right to be born. I think it would be ironic if we were now to take that one away and leave a gap or a vacuum. While I understand that there is proposed legislation to be put in its place, there is no certainty that would come through. Again, the fundamental aspect for me, having spoken with many people at home on this, is the question of life. For that reason, I am not in a position to support the Bill. I will certainly support the retention of the eighth amendment.";NULL
2393;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Danny Healy-Rae;Independent;"I wish to reiterate my firm belief that life begins when a baby begins to grow inside a woman. It is a crime to take a life. Let us go back to what abortion is. People should educate themselves that abortion is stopping the right of a little baby to live or continue its journey into this life from the mother's womb. I was absolutely disgusted and so upset when I heard the way it is done, with two injections, first one to paralyse the little baby and then another to stop his heartbeat and stop his life, and not give him the chance to live. That is terrible because life is a gift and a treasure. The babies that are born around the world tonight are our future; they are the world ahead of us. Once a baby is conceived, it has a right to live.

Everyone around the country, in this Chamber, at the Oireachtas committee and at the Citizens' Assembly, which was not elected by anyone and the membership of which was, I believe, selectively chosen, has had his or her say. The little unborn babies will not be able to say a word. That is where I have a serious difficulty, and nothing will ever change my mind. It is my duty, as an elected Member, to speak for them and to cite their right to continue their journey into this world. No one in this world has the right to take the life of another. There has been a lot of talk about babies throughout the country. Whether it is a growing child, a mother, a father or anyone else - even an elderly man living in the countryside who is killed by some blackguards - that is wrong, and it is wrong to take the life of an unborn baby. Only God decides when a life should end, and it is a good job it is that way.

Girls and women should have access to support. If they become pregnant and are despairing or in bother, they should receive help. They should receive plenty of counselling, financial support and whatever else. If they cannot manage, there are plenty of couples who would gladly adopt and cherish a little baby boy or girl if they were given the chance to do so. There is a great deal more available to women today than there was 50 years ago, when girls were frowned upon when they became pregnant out of wedlock. That is not the position today. There is contraception and so much education available, and rightly so. There is fierce respect for women and girls who become pregnant in today's world, which is wonderful. Life is a gift. I appreciate life and I will do so while there is a breath left in my body. Little unborn babies have the right to continue their journey into life.

The eighth amendment has served mothers and babies very well for the past 35 years. The referendum proposes to allow abortion on demand up to 12 weeks and, in other cases, may allow it up to 19 or 20 weeks. The referendum proposes to get rid of the eighth amendment but no other wording is being put in place to either protect the mother or the unborn baby. That we would leave it up to the Members of this Dáil or future Dáileanna is my major worry as I see so many Deputies in this Chamber supporting abortion. The small unborn baby making its way into this world will not stand a chance. I am asking all the good people throughout the country to remember the unborn baby, as we all once were, and to vote against the proposal to get rid of the eighth amendment, which has protected mothers and unborn babies for the past 35 years.

The Supreme Court ruled that the unborn baby has a constitutional right to life but does not have the right to life before it is born. What it is saying is that the unborn baby does not have the right to remain within the protection of the womb. To me, that is very contradictory and hard to understand. As I have said before, I am against allowing abortion of a little baby who has reached 12 weeks in a mother's womb. A baby at that stage is very well formed and has a heartbeat, a brain, a head, arms and legs. We all know that and no one should try to deny it. This baby cannot ask to be let live while everyone else can express a view. We have to remember the small unborn baby has done nothing wrong.

In all the debates that have taken place in recent years, there has been very little mention of the negative effective an abortion has had on many mothers. Once that little baby is gone, while the mother may have other babies, she will never forget the one she does not have.

I reject the idea proposed by some Deputies that parents should be allowed to have an abortion because they are not able to support and rear another baby. God help us, is that where we have got to now? What about all of the contraceptive methods and morning after pills? The last thing we should be talking about is getting rid of the little unborn baby.
So many people would love to have a baby but cannot. If a mother is in trouble, why can she not get help and seek to have her baby adopted by such people? Many couples would love to adopt a baby.

What about the lovely, big families that were reared around my neck of the woods? There were 22 Cahills, 17 Lovetts and 15 O'Connors who are still around. They were fine boys and girls. There were also 16 O'Sullivans. I know of a girl who has arrived in our neck of the woods from another county. She is very welcome. There were 22 in her family. She told me of how their father took them to school in a cattle box tied onto a Ford 3000 tractor. At one point, 14 of them were going to the local primary school at the same time.

Such families did not have the dole or social welfare and the children helped their parents to rear one another. None of them starved or perished from the cold. While we rightly criticise the Government for many failings, it is not legitimate to propagate abortion because the Government is failing in terms of housing, health and other services. However, some Members have the ridiculous idea of suggesting that the Government not providing services is the reason babies should be aborted. I named a number of families, but there are none like them anymore. Families with four, five or six children are considered large these days.

To everyone who will vote in the referendum, what is being proposed here is to get rid of the eighth amendment and allow for the abortion of babies up to 12 weeks gestation. There are many good people out there and a lot of them have been contacting me in recent months. They are appalled by the suggestion that unborn babies of up to 12 weeks gestation should be aborted. Maybe the Government is not in the real world or does not understand this, but they are rightly appalled. I ask people to reject this referendum out of hand. There will never be a second chance. As sure as day follows night, the 12 weeks will be increased to 19 weeks or maybe 25 weeks. What if someone like Hillary Clinton came along and got power in these Chambers? She said that it would be fine to abort babies up to eight and a half months.
There is a God in this world, because she did not become President of America. Whatever about President Trump - there is much criticism of him outside his country and many people are in favour of him in his country - it is a good job that someone like her did not get power, given how she propagated something like that. It was horrible and outrageous.

I was listening to the radio one evening recently when the Minister, Deputy Harris, stated that it was terrible to think of a mother coming home from abroad with her loved one in the boot of the car. I do not know what he meant by it, but the little dead baby did not feel very loved. It would not have made a difference if the baby was in the boot of the car in London, the North or the South - the unborn baby was dead at that stage. I was very hurt when I heard the Minister saying something like that.

If abortion is introduced, it will increase the number of abortions in our country. It will mean that most children with Down's syndrome or disabilities will be aborted.
The Government has its view and I have mine. If this referendum goes through, which I hope it does not, we will see in a short time who is right and who is wrong.

The Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee seemed to have one aim and one aim only on this issue, that being to recommend a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment as soon as possible. Throughout the process, they ignored anything and anyone who would get in the way of that. One must wonder why they ignored anyone who was in favour of the eighth amendment. Of what were they afraid? Perhaps they were afraid to put it on the record that, after 22 days, the little baby's heart is beating, the baby's brain is forming at six weeks, and the baby can be seen on ultrasound sucking its thumb at 12 weeks. Perhaps they were afraid to put it on the record that one in five pregnancies in England ended in abortion. Perhaps they were afraid to put it on the record that 90% of babies diagnosed in the womb with Down's syndrome were aborted.

If we are going to be afraid of anything in this debate, we should be afraid that the elected representatives in the House and the media are hiding these facts from the people in order to push through the repeal of the eighth amendment. This is what repeal will lead to.

There is no mystery about the lives that have been saved by the eighth amendment. We all know who they are. We all know people who got pregnant but took some time to get used to the idea of being parents. Maybe they thought about travelling for an abortion but, because it was not easily available in Ireland, they had enough time to think about it some more, change their minds and have their baby instead of an abortion.

I will not be voting to repeal the eighth amendment - I will vote to retain it. I have held this view for a long time. If I as someone who has been elected by the people of Kerry to represent them in the Thirty-second Dáil did not seek to protect the life of a small, unborn baby, I would not be worth much.

I forgot to mention a point. We were invited across the road to Buswell's Hotel approximately 12 months ago. A 39 year old lady from the USA told us her story. Her mother was forced to have an abortion by her grandmother.

One way or another, the abortion took place but she lived. She attended a meeting across the road and told her story. She was 39 years of age at that stage; she must be 40 now. Life is precious. When we see something like that happening, we realise the situation. There was nothing wrong with that woman. At that stage when she was an unborn baby, she had done nothing wrong. I am glad she lived and came over here to tell us her story. I worry about all the others who did not make it. I hope our country will reject the repeal of the eighth amendment and that it will be retained to protect the unborn baby and the mother.

2394;Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018: Second Stage (Resumed);20.03.18;M;Mr. Simon Harris;Fine Gael;"I thank all Deputies for their contributions to this Second Stage debate. I have had an opportunity to speak on this issue on a number of occasions in recent months, as have all Deputies. I hope in the not-too-distant future we will have an opportunity to stop speaking on this issue, or certainly to stop speaking to each other on it, and to start engaging with our constituents, communities and civil society as the people make a solemn, serious and complex choice.

Tonight has been quite an emotional debate in a way I did not expect it to be. The reason is that we are all professional politicians and we come in here and grapple with complex issues. We debate them and trade barbs every now and again. What has struck me tonight is that even people with whom I absolutely fundamentally disagree on this issue, and they with me, are grappling. We are all grappling to do the right thing. I genuinely believe that. It is important that as we grapple we do not try to create bogey men, call each other names or suggest that anybody places a greater value on life or that anybody cares more or less for one group of people. That is not a true or fair reflection of this debate.

I thank Deputy Ferris, in particular. I perhaps did not think I would say that in the House, and perhaps he did not think I would say it about him in the House, but that shows how the debate transcends party lines. Deputy Ferris has shared his family experience and insight which I greatly appreciate. We all do. The humanity the Deputy has brought to the debate, regardless of people's views on the issue, is important. It is important that we hear all those real stories because it is not an abstract concept. They are not faceless women, whatever decision they make. They are not numbers; they are people and they are women. They are people we know. They are our families and they live in our communities and they work alongside us. They are faced with complex situations and difficult decisions. Some people will make a decision and others will wish to make another decision. The problem I have at the moment is that in this country certain decisions are protected and viewed as okay and other decisions are not allowed.

I am sorry if I offended or upset Deputy Danny Healy-Rae but he did not hear what I said in the Dáil. I told the story of the couple I met. I sat with them. They had desperately wanted a child, had been told they were pregnant and were overjoyed. They were then told the baby would not live. They did not want to kill their baby or take their baby's life or any of those crude or vulgar terms. They wanted the baby badly but the baby was not going to live. The baby could not live. People were coming up to the pregnant mother asking if it was a boy or girl and asking when the baby would be born and whether she had picked a name. The couple knew that baby was not going to live. They knew the baby was either going to die in the woman's womb or straight after the baby was born from that womb. They had to go to the UK. That was the decision they made. They went to the UK and they had to bring their baby back in the boot of a car in a coffin. The House has heard similar stories from Deputy Ferris and on radio today. Deputies will hear different stories in the coming days from people who chose to do different things. It was not about being offensive or anything like that. It was about me telling the Dáil the story they shared. They cried when they told me that story and I cried with them. Very few people would not be moved by that story.

People have made a number of very important points tonight. I will refer to the points made by Deputies Rabbitte and Troy and many others on how we support people in crisis pregnancy. The cross-party committee did excellent work. If I was to pick a flaw, it is that they are called ancillary recommendations because they are important. The committee made recommendations on how we help people who find themselves in crisis pregnancies, how we reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, how we educate our younger generation on sexual health, how we provide greater access to contraception, and how we support the woman and her partner who decides to go ahead with a pregnancy to full term knowing the baby may only live for a few brief moments. We have a lot to do in that regard.

I said the last day I spoke in the Dáil that I will bring proposals to Government. They will not be proposals that I will say we will introduce if people vote ""Yes"" but proposals I want to introduce anyway in line with the committee's recommendations. They will look at things like the different types of contraception and how we can make it more available, how we can address the committee's finding that in some cases cost is a barrier to access, how we look at things like perinatal hospice care and put concrete proposals in place to help in that regard, and how we look at greater access to counselling and sexual health education so that all our children learn about sexual health in an age appropriate fashion as they go through our education system.

I have been taking notes of some of the suggestions Deputies have made here tonight on some of the things I should consider in the context of bringing forward that package of proposals. It is a very important part. Regardless of what one's view is or what label we put on one's view, we can all agree - it has disappointed me that we have not all agreed - we have not heard every campaign, regardless of its perspective, say it is a sensible thing to do to provide people with greater access to contraception and that it is a good idea to provide more perinatal hospice care and to provide better sex education in our schools. Unfortunately, I have not heard unanimity break out on that, which worries me because it is a common sense thing that we should all do.

I will make another point but I will not get into the substantive issues of the legislation that will follow. I will get into it at length again as I have already in the House, but today we are concerned with the referendum Bill. It is about putting the proposal to the people and giving them a chance to have their say. That is what the referendum Bill is about. I have a duty to put forward what I propose to introduce should the people vote ""Yes"". I have done that. I have produced a policy paper which has been ratified by Government and is published on my Department's website. All Deputies have seen it. We discussed it here the week before last - all the weeks are running into one on this but I think it was the week before last. I will very shortly publish the heads of that Bill so, as Deputy Fleming referenced, it will be more than a policy paper and people will get to see the legalistic language as it develops into a Bill.

People keep talking about my proposals and the Government's proposals. They were not picked by me or plucked from the air and they did not fall from the sky. They were the cross-party committee's proposals. I appreciate there were Deputies - Deputy Mattie McGrath was on that committee - who did not share those views. I appreciate there was not unanimity on the committee. I absolutely appreciate it but in my view it was the best thinking of a cross-party committee and the best effort at trying to reach consensus on an extraordinarily complex issue. There was not a consensus but it was the best effort. When one reads through the testimony and the transcripts, as I have many times, one sees that the committee did not just wake up in the morning and decide it was the way to go. It put huge effort into arriving at those proposals. There is an onus on me as Minister. The sensible thing to do as Minister for Health is to proceed on the basis of those recommendations and to allow them to form the basis of what we do.

I hope we can pass Second Stage. I hope that after the passage of Second Stage of the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 we can scrutinise the legislation further this week in the House on Committee and Report Stages and discharge our duties as Members of the Oireachtas. We have talked a lot about rights and conflicting rights. We have rights as Members of the Oireachtas to scrutinise legislation. We have an obligation. That has to be balanced with the right the people should have to have their say on this issue. I hope we can get the balance right in the Dáil this week and hopefully in Seanad Éireann next week so that we can allow the people of Ireland to have their say in a referendum by the end of May. I am conscious that every party leader in the House, to the best of my knowledge, has given a public commitment that they would like to see the referendum by the end of May so there can be maximum participation by civil society. There is an onus on all of us to work together to facilitate that.

The debate has continued to be respectful and it is important that we set the tone in this House so that, when the debate leaves the House, that tone can be continued.

There will be plenty of time to tease out and discuss the issues and like others, I hope we hear from doctors, regardless of their perspective. When we talk about this, everybody becomes a gynaecologist or an obstetrician, though of course we are not. I hear people who are not doctors making definitive statements as to what happens in a clinician's room or an operating theatre and I hear people purporting to be nurses giving their views on what a nurse would do, only to have to retract and concede that they were never nurses. It is important that we hear from medical professionals, from women, regardless of their perspective, and from civil society. I will go back to Cabinet next week on a general scheme of the legislation I would propose if the people vote ""Yes"". I will also introduce a package of measures to reduce crisis pregnancies, to improve access to contraception and to improve the availability of a comprehensive sex education programme to protect the sexual health and well-being of our young people.
